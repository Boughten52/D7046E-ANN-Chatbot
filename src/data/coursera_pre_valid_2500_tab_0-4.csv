i loved being able to hear directly from the leaders of the civil rights movement the course videos were short enough that i got through the course in two saturday afternoons the stories interwove historical events and insights practical strategies for mobilizing and inspiringmoving confessions of light in even the darkest timessome of my favorite parts included learning about the followingjails were used as active classrooms for university students they even shared info on college access with a jail ward crazythe civil rights leaders honored all peoples dignity and believed in their mission beyond what seemed to be in front of their eyes who would have thought that the jailed students would sing to jail staff by name that theyd build a relationship with them that theyd sing songs of such conviction to uplift their spirits and to warn the system to be prepared for the many more whod soon join their movementandrew youngs confession about what his wife told him after they read about dr lafayette essentially drop everything we gotta go back home now their sacrifice and courage even when they had everything set up for them in the north are incredible to witnessthe crosscontinental influences i ddint know jim lawson was a divinity school student who ended up learning nonviolence in india where he lived  years as a missionary the intersection of faith social justice calling crosscultural sharingempowering were themes i found unable to shake from my mind days after i finished this coursethe civil rights movement was fiercely organized and executed it didnt happen accidently over night or by fury or whim of young folks alone even the young  so many of the leaders were so young  had a very clear strategy to winning against structural racism and even their sacrifices dares so to speak were planned and not foolish they knew what dangers or threats there may be but it was always with a clear goal and purpose that they put themselves in the act of civil disobediencei will be spending my upcoming months going through the readings books and independent research to learn more about the civil rights movements and its leaders i was not taught any of this in detail in highschool which i feel that it should this course is timely and much needed as its been disparaging to try to remain engaged and active under trumplandia thank you to those who lived this history thank you so much for translating your experiences into another digestible course so that less informed folks like me can encounter albeit late your bravery intelligence and accomplishments which should never be forgotten	4

good focus on ideas vs principles the focus on relational algebra is a great way to look at data manipulation in general unfortunately relational algebra is explained quite well but not really applied after that this could be a great course if it really taught to constantly think in terms of relational algebraokayish explanations of databases and hadoop not very deep and not always structured but rather focused on the technology principles instead of the data principlesi think that this specialisation suffers the same problem most data sciencemininganalytics courses suffer it ignores the nontechnical starting point scientific or business relevance how does one organise data get to know completely new data understand possible value ie how to start a data science project if all there is is unorganised data and the wish to do something with it	1

great for getting to know not only about python but about overall programming too	3
really enjoyable course  this was my second time of taking it as i wanted to revise the topic this time around i didnt have the time to engage in the forums as much and found that i missed the lively discussions there	4
i liked the course very much for a foreign speaker though i found it particularly challenging the nuances of words are particularly important when dealing with matters of style and i struggled through the exercises which i found a bit more abstract than those in preceding courses of this series maybe it was just selfconsciousness in any case because i encountered this struggle the course was helpful in making me think about how do i want to pursue my next steps in the process of creative writing  should i continue in english or should i try instead to do it in my native language i am sure this is a question that many other students have asked themselves i shouldnt conclude without saying that i do recommend the course in any case	3
thank you david i enjoyed this class thoroughly and learned so much i feel much more confident in being able to work directly with accountants and finance professionals as you said there is so much more to learn and im thinking about going back to university to take an accounting degree the pace with which you conduct your lessons is very nice and your diction is pleasant and easy to understand the real life examples help	4

most interesting compact comprehensive and a real life saver a million thanks to prof raj and the whole team	4
very well organised course the content is well explained by richard and progresses in an comprehensible manner the only tweak i believe is necessary is to look at the ordering of the questions in each of the quizes as some of the intended sequential questions are not in order and result in fragmented and more difficulty processing the cases	4

excellent tips and tricks we usually dont know about learningtips and tricks that we must know in order to do the best	4
illuminating and broad this course was much more than the titles suggest or its provenance from a law lecturer would hint at spanning history culture sociology and politics this is a wide ranging tour of the modern world muslims live in utterly fascinating	4
the lecturer explained things very detailed oriented and the materials are very helpful to use for a nonnative speaker	4
 the title is misleading since at scale led people to think that large scale data processing platform such as spark and nosql databases will be central to the course right from the start the assignments need a lot of improvements i am not happy with how were often only required to submit a single number as an answer the biggest problem is that this way the grader wont be able to give you meaningful feedback  hint of where you might be wrong a grader that only tells you your answer is incorrect does little to help you learn from mistakes i think assignment  can be paced differently  now it feels that we have a bunch of very easy parts ag that is not very interesting where the last three are significantly harder	1
honored to be a learner of this course have attended a lot of leadership workshop but this one is the best	4
thank you so much for providing such a good course for us	4

love this course insightful and well presented	4
teacher is awesome and very useful course	4
this course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry but the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful for example the instructor talks about project management public speaking how to write a resume etc the instructor starts by talking about why they are useful and then followed by one to two  minutes long video lectures each of these could worth a full coursera course and i am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this coursethe quiz questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all some of the correct answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quizthe third peer grading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himselfherself or to pitch the game the student makes however the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skills beyond the basics unless you are already in the industry i do not think anyone can make anything impressive to be worth pitching in front of the audience	1
i can beat my chest and say i know bootstrap it was an awesome experience i was taught well which is a whole lot better than self learningteaching which leaves a you with a whole lot of unknown information about the subject	4

excellent environment to get acquinted with r specifically the swirl programme inside r is really helpful and will get you the basics of how you can work in r in a very efficient wayfor me as a clinical researcher some more information on how to clean your data and run your analysis would be very useful but this course is mostly focussed on programming your own functions	3
very interesting and pertinent to work i am doing	4

excellent course even for nonenglish speakers i really enjoy the humor of everyone	4
you are not actually writing any code for this particular course the assignments are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code repository for this course the lectures are great there is a lot to learn from them but the assignments are a total bust not worth it for the money but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization	2
full of info tips and strategies and very engaging videos many thanks	4

good for the beginners to programming	3
the teachers there do not do what they teach they rattle down their text as fast as they can speak and do not emphasize the content with movement or even change of expression i was disappointed	0

great way to get started in this field	4
perfect course i have ever had till now	4
amazing experience throughout course	4
i had indeed to look for codecamp to practice all the small commands how to deal with vectors swirl does not allow you to follow up so clearly i wish you guys could implement a little r interface so we can follow you closerthe last project quiz demands you a huge amount of time if you do not have much experience they could shorten a little the questions i know that one takes to the other but i only had time to finish the first and understand yes perhaps i am not the best but you are offering the course to people who are not born programmersi think that it would benefit strongly from a clear distinction between how to deal with vectors matrix dataframe etc separately instead of the huge videos with bullet points of the potentialities we need to practice more i like theory and i know how important but i dont think that i learn much from the lessons or quizzes how to code something like the last part i dont think it build my knowledge until i understand how to create that script for week i had to look around in all the internet buying books read more just my opinion i think you guys could give small scripts or asking smaller tasks to lead people until they understand how to build thatalso has its positives i really learnt great tips and technically i know a lot of r potential	2
this course is awesome dr chucks super explanation and lectures make it easier to understand stuff initially i wanted to review a couple of videos but ended up completing all assignments	4
totally awesome	4
very good course overall it gave me some good thought nuggets to keep in mind for the future at times the course felt more like it was trying to sell the notion of home cooking rather than being about food and health sometimes terms were hastily presented and maybe assumed to be common knowledge which left me confused in one of the quizzes serum triglycerides for instancethe course touches on interesting topics that couldve been elaborated more on for instance how transfats are made	3
a very clear and straightforward course giving a foundation for the following learning of machine learning	4
this course is a natural linear progression from entrepreneurship 	4

very interesting with a good exposure of the topics	4

the course content is very good and is must have if you missed that stuff in colledge it teaches of algorithmic analysis so you know which algorithm is more efficient gives some examples of cool techniques and provides challenges to apply those techniqueshowever there are things that i hate about this course first of all this is about forums they are broken down into sessions and there are too little people on each session staff provides exactly zero help if you are stuck you have no hope on these forums and will need to find help somewhere elseprogramming assignments are great they are relevant interesting challenging and the automatic grader system estimates not only if we get the correct answer but also the efficiency of our algorithm there have been some problems in divide and conquer section though ive been struggling with implementing binary search which is quite a simple algorithm in javascript to pass the assignment for weeks ive written and rewritten it in different ways done hundreds of manual and automated tests posted on course forums receiving zero answers and have gotten the same error again and again i was able to solve this only by switching to python i am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case which cost me hours and hours overall the programming assignments are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worsei do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails perhaps if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programmer but i felt more like it was wasting of our time the main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding angersome lecturers have a strong russian accent that is very distracting it is not a lot of work to take some english pronunciation training before making a course isnt itoverall i enrolled for the specialization and planned to buy it in full but bought only this course to start with now i am glad i did that because now i am not sure about buying the other courses and will look somewhere else firstanyway the creators of the course have done a great job which is highly appreciated i believe you can make this course much better by fixing the issues i pointed above	3

although the course content is highly informative and interesting the way its all presented it not the best most of the time concepts are confusing because of this quizzes become guessing games most of the time forums feel neglected by the course tutor lots of question that someone knowledgeable should answer become random rambling as nobody is sure as to what the tutor actually meant as somebody said on the forums i feel like im alpha testing your course	2

i think it is really nice	4
good course i enjoyed learning chemistry however the pdf slides could be much better made since most of them are empty and the errors in the quiz should be corrected	2
it was nice succinct and extremely inspiring for some amateur seeking the meaning of art	4
picks up where the previous course left off the last assignment is a bit more challenging than the others well for me it was thanks to the people who put the course together	4
it gets  stars only because i learned new things in the class but the teacher bless his heart for meaning well ended up being rather annoying and distracting with his constant antics its okay to throw that in every now and then but this was really awful makes you want to forward to the parts where he is normal thats when you can pay attention to him and understand it all think you should ask him to tone it down big time everything in small doses is greati think there is an unfair marking system in the last week  i wrote about it too i dont want to pay for a course and have my points cut for silly reasons if thats how it works i never want to pay for certificates whats the point in paying for subjectivity or having to adapt my answers to suit the course	2
this course completely opened my eyes as a team lead software development is now very clear	4

python data structures is a great course for anyone who is interested in learning computer programming the concepts taught here are very relevant to the field of computer science and apply to any programming language the fact that this course uses python for teaching programming is not a limitation but rather a boon for students who may be intimidated by other programming languages python is easy and very fun to learn it is also utilized by many large companies for things such as data analysis and modeling so developing a fluency with python is a valuable skilldr chuck speaks and teaches well and he is very enthusiastic about the subject of computer science my favorite thing about him is that he shows multiple examples during lectures it also helps that he knows how to relax and have fun at times i highly recommend him to any student	4
needs to pay for submit assignments	0
good course to get you thinking about python	3

its a wonderful course to learn the basic knowledge of diabetes the course design is wonderful and it never looks boring one of the best online course	4
the course is well presented and the content is packed with information and great techniques to use in your work world and in everyday life i really enjoyed the lectures and scott derue besides being a world leader in his field is an engaging and personable speaker who brings the course to lifedespite the course being very engaging and worthwhile i am dismayed that you cannot take the tests if you do not buy the certificate of completion option i understand purchasing the course certificate and understand that it costs time and resources to put this course together however since the tests are scored by a computer the developers are not doing any work for free if they allow test access and scoring to those who choose not to buy the certificate option by barring the those people from taking the tests the mooc suddenly becomes not so open anymore people often wonder how a process or a product gets from a to b where it goes from open access to access for a limited few this the little step of denying access to test taking in courses that purport to be open is that first step once this take further hold more and more course will become less and less open and the mooc system becomes the moc system of just being massive online coursesplease maintain the spirit of the mooc by allowing testing access to all learners not just to those who pay for the certificate thank you	4
after teaching english for many years i found answers to old questions and new challenges to work on the course was worth every minute i invested in it	4
i found the process effective and helpful the fact it connects to earlier courses and lay out the build up of the project over weeks is excellent having the final task a compilation of earlier work with executive summary is excellent model at some stages i felt time pressure given my work duties and i am happy the process made it easier to continue	4

very interesting clear and usefull	4
slightly slow and not hugely thorough but very practical	3
in my opinion some lectures do not fully explain the theory or do not show enough practical application of the theory and i am not talking about real life application but the ones given later on the test had to refer to the internet on multiple occasions to fully understand the materialhowever have to say pretty good course overall give you the idea of what type of knowledge one needs to understand the game theory help to build your mindset	3
good course few things towards the end of course were not quite clear to me	3
this was a deep dive into all things regression and i guess having a background in mathematics helped out a lot with following the material however i wish there was a better distribution of quizzes and assignments throughout the weekly lessons because they seemed to all come during the end of the lesson all in all this was a very good course and i wish that i would have taken a similar course during my undergrad	3
i loved it i just got very bad headaches with that white background	3
i study this course still	3
simple to follow	4

very useful course	4
im really sorry to give this rating but i have no choice the course was horrendously boring and so far removed from the interesting and interactive work that we had done in the previous sections of the specialisation this is such an unfortunate course to have as a requirement to complete the specialisation and especially the final hurdle to get into the capstone moreover it was the longest of all the courses thus the least interesting and also the longest  makes little senseas i said im sorry to give this rating but it needs to be said the teacher seems like a great guy and im sure hes killing it teaching statistics and r studio at uni but using r studio to such a standard just doesnt seem like the everyday work an hci designer would do a statistician or data specialist yes but a ui designerperhaps you could make the course higher level avoid the indepth r studio and make it  weeks like all of the other courses	0
simple and interactive course	4
good and interesting course on the basics of project management videos are very clear and the information is good accessable it could be stuffed in  week but spread it out over  weeks is better to let it sink in it may be interesting to add a quick overview of other management styles for example for projects with very high uncertainties and different types of business	3

the lesson is really useful	4
that was a very good experiencealso ive got to admit that teacher is the best	4
good course	4
challenging course offered balance of study and testing  essays  short tests and one final exam the quality of interviews study sources and presentation by professionals was secondtonone by coursera standards this course is demanding if you take the course you need to have a background in tax or be prepared to study over  hours per week if you follow the guidelines and substantial source documents and presentations you should be able to pass the course more importantly focusing on the issues ways and means that global enterprises have benefited from weak tax treaties and domestic laws is an eyeopener every politician elected to public office should take this course very done leidens centre for international tax law is clearly a world leader in tax law study and assessment	4
a very very good introduction to inferential statistics a very systematic review of this topici like very much the videos they did very lively this is a proof that they have put a lot of efforts on itthe teachers also give very important remarks to lead us think in the good way	4

i would rename this course as programming octave with application to machine learning rather that machine learning once you start the course you will have to focus on octave rather than on ml topics if you want to do programming exercises there is no degree of freedom in programming you are provided with a lot of weird octave codes which you will have to complete instead of writing yourself from scratch more than  of my time was spent in order to learn octave and understand guess octave codesso if you really want to learn ml and try it in practice this course is not for you however you could just watch the videos whose level is not more that elementary introduction to ml	0

i recommend this course   to everyone who really want to know what is the best way to learn anything the correct way to me helped me a lot	4

very well organized and informative course	4
the course taught so many useful techniques ive insightful knowledge about how the brain works and apply those knowledge into effective learning	4
the beginning sections of the course were interesting as they were descriptive of some pragmatic approaches towards thinking and learning like the pomodoro technique excuse me if spelling is wrong the later portions could have been better although they werent that bad either overall i learned how to learn	2
great course although the paste of the course was a bit slow for a person who is already familiar with programming languages other than python speeding up the sessions solved everything the only draw back which prevents this course from reaching five stars is the lack of more challenging problems that could have been put in the course as a bonus for those who are after wrestling with codes a bit more the rest is good	3
nice things to do and good examples	3
instructor really made this course if you want to learn about map theory and why maps are interesting and important you need to check out this course dr anthony robinson did a commendable job keeping the material compelling and the class a worthwhile venture i can only hope he will hold more courses in the future	4

great course their are parts that are dry and very academic but taking the time to listen and take will payoff and be very rewarding i particularly found the neuroscience research most interesting and engaging the labs are a great way to end tie together everything that is learned in each section from academic to science to historyapplication	4
the lectures can be a bit dry but this is a wonderfully fascinating subject and well worth the time to explore if youre at all interested in human behavior	4
an excellent course by a computer scientist phd the course was very well presented at a steady pace and in a lovely clear voice pity some courses online arent so professionally clearthe assessments and especially the final one ensure that one focuses and aims for perfect syntactic and semantic code  which is what all developers should be striving for now im very pleased that i achieved  great job colleen van lent  now im interested in the second course in the series introduction to css	4

short and crisp course on design thinking  a good crash course and introduction to a few design thinking innovation tools that can be applied in practice almost immediately after the course is completed practical but it can do with some more case studies and deliberate discussion questions every week to keep the discussion board focused and engaged	3

introduction to sustainability has given me greater insight on the world on a sustainable path whether we are approaching a j curve or s curve this course broadens your knowledge and sharpens your mind to be a great thinker when it comes to sustainability and im glad to partake and complete this course	4
good course for beginners	4
videos are very brief  slide presentations of course outline one has to depend entirely on reading materials to understand the course	1
the assignment instructions and grading criteria are unclearincomplete because of this given these are peer graded assignments it is likely to lose marks because the peers interpreted the instructions differently some of the topics covered in the lectures are not covered in the assignments while other topics which are not covered are all assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code the lecture videos contain a lot of code examples but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the api sometimes the code examples in the slides contain mistakes it sometimes felt like the content covered in the videos could have been delivered in a much shorter time	1
excellent course i thoroughly enjoyed the scientific advancements and studies presented throughout the course	4
a great course well presented with clear objectives and instruction that ensures successful outcomes well put together engaging i walked away from this with an indepth understanding of how to apply the materials each area was fully and carefully explained and demonstrated most fun ive had with a mooc such a good teacher who anticipates the questions and provide the answers	4
this course certainly connected all the knowledge i had about the universe and where we are heading towards and why	4

course contentthe material is very cool a lot of topics are covered as for me sometimes it was hard to understand the material because there werent enough visualization and animation would be good to visualizeanimate content more like in andrews ng ml course less text more visualizationorganizationsome links were broken some quizzesassignments were without filespictures so it is bad	3

very informative course i like the ocntent of it and how it progresses through it however i think it can improve in termms of practical examples on the differences when changing values of parameters	3
its really useful thanks so much	4
the material is not presented in a cohesive manner in video questions are not very good and dont make sense often since this is the only course of its kind on coursera you dont have many options either the material seems very arbitrary and even with a basic knowledge of machine learning and advanced mathematics it is difficult to understand the first week and the types of neurons presented understanding which is essential i think	2

great course	4
dr chucks explanations are clear and all the lessons are easy to follow focus on relevant web technologies perfect pace examples based on popular apis as someone with some basic knowledge in programming already i was expecting the assignments to be more challenging as clearly announced on the website this course is targeted at beginners who took the previous courses from the same teacher all exercises can be solved in about  lines of code and the solutions can be directly applied from the videos without much further thinking the rest of you will like me breeze through it in no time kudos for the interesting interview videos proposed as bonus material	3
it was an useful course i believe that i will use the tools learned in this course	3
very well explained this course and specialization are really good	3
very good course the classes were very elusive and the teacher is amazing	4
a good start for studying machine learning much better than directly taking a ml algorithm and try different parameters	4
great teaching 	4
very useful this course thanks	4
a very thoughtengaging and enjoyable course i learned a lot about the history and contexts of various muslim countries the challenges faced by them as well as the practical challenges that islamicbased political thought have not demonstrably addressed so far the instructor is very knowledgeable and wellmeaning i like the courses approach of not so much attempting to answer the questions as just a tour guide and an entry point to the much more complex discussion about the topic i might not agree with everything in the course and some of his statements might have made me a bit uncomfortable but overall this is an engaging and insightful course	4
i had always fascinations for machine learning and ai things this course helped me to understand things very much really appreciated every task provided	4
i really like this course because it covers many interesting things related to developing internet of things solutions with raspberry pi sensors and web services the course is easy to follow i especially like that there are a few home assignments each week that could be done in a couple of hours i also like frequent quizzes it helps to learn things better there are a couple of small things i wish the course could done a bit better update videos with the latest bluemix ui and slow down a bit when showing a demo on how things could be done on the bluemix site and nodered editor otherwise it was fun and very useful course i highly recommend it to all my friends	4
solid content and dedicated teach staff	4
absolutely great brian winn is just amazingly concise and to the point pragmatic organized exhaustive in every detail and alternative variation a fantastic course thank you	4
this course is very basic for a person with an it background but nevertheless might come in handy for people without relevant experience	2
nice introduction to the subject teacher and presentations were easy to understand and not too dry homework assignments were interesting and peer reviewing other peoples submissions helped get pointers on what i couldve done better	3
this is the best machine learning course for everyoneeasy to understand and straightforwardthank you andrew eg lovely tas and warm hearted subtitle groups 	4

very good as introduction to this area of implementation  it will be very interesting to create another course with more advanced topics	4
this is an amazing coursethank you dr brown for allowing me to pursue this course from the comforts of my homeand thank you coursera	4
this course is so great and i want to thank prof schmidt cause every explanation is clear	4
good course as the name says covers the stuff every engineer should know about	3
the course as intended was just an overview which sometimes can leave the student with a lot of questions which i guess was intentional too also i feel the instructors were trying a bit too hard to sound cool and fun or maybe its just that i am  and i cannot relate to it much the content was excellent and the course serves an ideal platform for the launch of the specialisationkindly give other free options of software since graphlab is paid i small session on scikit nolearn or any equivalent machine learning package would be extremely helpful	3
a good brush up and clear information a bit basic for me personally this should be stated more clearly	3
very informative truly enjoyed this course	4
this course was very interesting it gave me many things to think about as i prepare to become a teacher i liked the different articles and i now have different ways to think about teaching and learning	4
so helpful i learned a lot	3
this course was a loss of time and money except from week  material the rest can be found on the internet and should be required by everyone who wants to take that specialization this course doesnt worth it its just to take extra money from anyone who wants to learn about data science	0
with the new tools on hand such as the pomodoro technique i feel more confident in finishing courses ive been wanting to take for a long time	4
i found this course to be highly informative i also discovered new methods to address common leadership problems	4
so far as good as previous courses in this specialization course materials are pretty easy to follow and course load is very balanced	4
its a great learning venture  opportunity for beginners and students to learn  gain knowledge from high qualified experts n faculties kudos to coursera	4
excellent course i knew next to nothing about coding and learnt loads from this with the help of very enjoyable and imaginative teaching	4
after digging around in the mooc world for a bit in search of a more current course i came to the conclusion that this course is still the best reasons are it offers a solid theoretical foundation and it doesnt use all the builtin libraries when it comes to implementing the core concepts i feel confident that i can now tackle a more current course with a better idea of what goes on behind the hood a truly great course	4
really helpful course to understand the fundamentals of accounting and its business implications this course is a must for anybody without an accounting background and willing to get into business i did the course before starting my mba and it definitely helped me afterwards	4
great course and instructor requires no prerequisites and goes quite deep will teach alot about web development and instructor responds in forums with detailed replies active community	4
i think the exercises could be more deep	3
amazinghelped me a lot	4
great introduction to the different statistical software packages gitgithub intro to data science terminology and basic command functions to get started	4
there could be more work in the assignments in this course the quizzes are very simple	2
i just review the first week of the course and i think this course is what i want it will help me to build my longterm health	4
complicated course that requires lots of mathematic background	3
this course has helped transform my life evidencebased research on happiness has been powerful for me thank you kindly	4

cool course and good quality	4
great material and lectures giving a nice scope of what happened and what is going on very nice class	4
the topdown approach of this course is the best way to understand concepts and view solutions for realworld applications this way i can go deeper after understanding why i am doing this	4
a great course i have learned valuable skill which are applicable for research	4
a fastpaced overview of compiler construction and the associated run time environment	4
heavy contents unable to cover a weeks material in a week	0
i think chuck is easily one of the best instructors i have studied under and like the previous courses he has been really good in this course as well however i think in the week  lectures he could have spent a bit more time to explain all the different concepts he has usedintroduced in his programs some of which he had explained previously but some of them are surely not covered before example the use codecsopen and when to use that and so onthere are other examples as well overall the course is very well taught although the last assignment was just too easy and does not really test the knowledge and understanding of the subject	3
it really opens your mind and gives you a better understanding of a very complex topic that is doping	4
i am very happy with this course its easy and helped me a lot 	4
extremely helpful course	4
even if i have worked with bootstrap before i found this course very useful to review and deepen my skills the lessons and exercises are very clearly explained the course is easy to follow and very enjoyable i took this course as part of the full stack web development specialization	4
great course to introduce nonprofessionalsbeginners into major fields or topics of philosophy excellent quality of lessons teachers were always good to understand even for nonnative speakers and eager to get across main themes to disciples inexperienced in philosophical studies only critique difficulty levels of exams could have been more evenly balancedi can only recommend this course to anyone interested in the study of philosophy great job by the university of edinburgh and its staff for organizing this on coursera	4
great course	4
excellent course with lots of practical exercises	4
this is a fantastic course well designed and incredibly useful as far as course content	3
not the best course for beginners too much theory and no implementation also the assignments were impossible for a beginner	0
i enjoyed the content and applications cant wait to continue on	4
really good course great materials and well structured	3
the exercises need more work done if the students are expected to actually learn this stuff	2
this course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good the instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible rd pengs courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum simple language having a background in theoretical physics and computer science this duality in this course is very confusing for me also i do not need to see a tiny grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos	1
i wish the course was longer the professor did a fantastic job of making the content fascinating and engaging please please please make another mooc	4
a class on modern american poetry and ezra pound was only treated secondarily crazyas well much of my time on recommended reading was spent looking for the poetry why are there no links to the poetry we are learning about	2
a good course the methods and pace was not good enough i wonder if those new to these topics learnt anything	1
really gain a lot from the courses	4
it is a very good course for beginnners  i have proramming experinece but i wanted to learn python and this was the right choice	4
learned a lot from this beginner course in python a very good icebreaker to getting into programming thank you instructors	4
it does what it says	4
excellent course well rounded and each section compliments the learnings of others thank you so much jeffery for providing this to us for free	4
just started this course but so far love the graphics and the enthusiasm of the teachers	3
i like it very much i have engineering background i think differently than others a lot this class provides me a different perspective	4
very interesting topic about law and an economic aspect of law and its application	4
great learing experience	4
very good lot of new learning and understanding i liked the responsiveness of discussion forum is great it helped a lot as learning new subjectpoints for improvement video may rerecorded as screens are different now in bluemix i also there are material to learn on this iot platform like blockchain managed device and edge analytics it would have been covered in this course	3
very important and complete	4
interesting research with practical applications	4
nice course to get a fair idea for beginners	4
welldone introduction to html css and javascript including jquery	4
quite useful and hard	3
as already explained in the preceding question this mooc is less well built and thus useful than the preceding one partly due to the lack of time and efforts to present the tools among which the score the savoir relier protocol which stays on the whole quite theoretical and some of the leadership models which are given too short a time for students to really make themselves an opinion about ittoo many interventions from oriane and references to what was certainly a nice show would be good to balance testimonies from young students with more development coming from mature managersthis said on the whole the mooc stays a very interesting activity and my last word will be to thank the team and wish for the sr community to become live as i have found the conversation a very useful and surprising method	2
straightforward interesting and easy to follow i wish it were a bit more challenging	3
amazing coursed	4
so thanks prof i think that it was a great course and really my hope now is to visit greece to recall homersocrateshesiodsolonas a course ancient greeks resource me much and i advice all students to take this wonderful course	4
thanks professor for explicit farreaching and inspiring explanations on big data culture now i am more clear about my career goal and have decided which data analysis tools to learn	4
i was so excited for this course but it failed miserably i am a complete newbie i didnt know one thing about iot before engaging in this course i gave it one star due to actually learning a small something in spite of the fact the prof is extremely inarticulate the course is extremely short and vague there was no care in detail or discussion or presentation theres no forum to ask questions or to even start or engage in a discussion	0
the lecturers try to keep the instructions basic and pedagogical pretty good everything in this revolves around a tool graphlab create not so great i think it is not free you get a one year licence and hides all the action from the user i dont like that the course then makes me feel that i must rely on a specific product to solve problems	0
really good insight into the pricing of financial instruments	3
some parts are needed more clarification in other words as a student of the course you need to go beyond the materials since the materials are not selfsufficient specially about simulation methods however this is not the reason that i give the course  out of  the absence of any help from tas based on my experience is the reason i expected some official replies to my question while there are only a few question for each week of the course	3
this course has given me some good new insights into perceiving data and has got me started nicely i am very great full	3
the adequate explanations about clauses and the exercises linked to each chapter brought me a lot of confidence in my english writing	4
good initiative	4
this class is superb while doing the project i am learning concepts gradually and the functionality of my project is also growing during the process perfect learning experience	4
i was pretty disappointed with this course firstly the course did not seem well balanced meaning that some weeksparticularly week had a lot of materials to watch and really felt like it was two weeks crammed into one and then other weeks barely had anythingsecondly the exercises seemed unclear poorly thought out and not really helpful there were many errata that really should have been fixed in the beta iterations of this coursethirdly i really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithmsfourthly the scaling section was also a major disappointment while it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic gradient descent i think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classifiers work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using sparkfinally given that graphlabdatoturi was just acquired by apple i question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as all the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist	0
could be more challenging but i really enjoyed the course highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn java and data structures	3
great course	4
very interesting course excellent teacher	4
ive loved this journey with passionate teacherslearners they share a general mindset and powerful tips to optimize our learning already profitable for me	4
really like this course with abundant exercises detailed explanation realworld data and sweeeeet professor it is a good start for sql beginner	4
a very good course but it was a little narrow because it focused on the professors own research perhaps one or two lectures on other trends ad research results from the wider field of positive psychology would be apt	3
this is a well thought out course and delivery by the lecturer is superb	4
videos were ok practice quizzes somewhat helpful however the final autograder quiz was extremely temperamental and gave no usable feedback this resulted in frustration and made what should have been a good experience a very bad oneupdated course to three stars since a change was made to be able to pass the final quiz without needing to pass the autograder submission	2
great course	4
i love the course it is very easy to understand and the professor is excellent very grateful thank you	4
great course to get started introduction to concepts is really well structured	4
it is a good course very helpful	4
it is a very good course for everyone to learn basic of korean for me who have learned korean by read korean lesson book somehow this course not give much thing to learngrammar this course is good because it give me more insight about korean grammar difference between normal formal and informal speech the using of 예요 이에요 이가 etcthe teacher she explain clearly and give some exercise in the video to make us practice i like the methodvocabulary there were not much vocabulary in the course i hope yonsei university would add more new vocabulary in the coursetest assignment ive taken another language online course at another site that similar to coursera that sites assignments more complex than this courses given this site only test our reading and listening but there were not speaking aspect that scored here and i wish you will add writing aspect to the courselesson the lessons those given here really simple they were easy to understand but i hope there will be a sequel of this course that will give us more advance lessonsrecommendation add more vocabulary add speaking and writing assignment a sequel of this coursethank you for coursera and yonsei university for giving me an opportunity to learn korean language for free	3
great	3
very clear introduction	4
designed more for a child learning about poetry for the first time some of the facts about poetry arent accurate the effort to make the class more engaging ironically only distracts from the course material the time spent attempting humor could have been spent on teaching but instead a lot of time is wasted by speaking down to the viewer like they are a toddler i did not finish this class as i couldnt stand the videos	1
im so glad i enrolled for this course	4
its a great course	4
this is a great course it is challenging but that comes with the territory if you want to write code i like the fact that the assignments are challenging and long the only issue i had is that i work fulltime and hardly have the  hours a week to spend on the programming assignments also the estimated times listed for each assignments are not realistic for somebody learning the topics in this course for the first time i would recommend this course to anybody wanting to learn how to develop web apps and api web services using rails with mongodb as the backend just be prepared to dedicate a lot of time each week especially weeks assigment i ran out of time and had to transfer to a new session to complete the course because of my fulltime job it would be beneficial for students to have a spare week in between the third and fourth assignment	4
thank you drchuck	4
great course i learned very interesting keys and skills	4
the course meterial was state of the art as a software development engineer i know a bit of opengl and i personally found it interesting to see how much is really covered in unity already so that you can really focus on game flow more than on nitty details of trail rendering for example	4
great preparation for college	4
this course is perfect in all ways	4
this is really an awesome course lecture videos by prof hornstein are very lucid informative and bang on point thank you sir and thank you coursera for this superb platform	4
amazing content well presented and very applicable to anyone who leads people so much of what was covered resonated at a deep level for me i return to this course again and again for inspiration and i share and recommend it with many other friends and colleagues	4
this is my first class here at coursera and it was fantastic good teachers good reading material	4
awesome course great instructor and fun assignments	4
very nice course it is worth taking	4
very good introductory course nice little assignments to complete my peers were supportive and encouraging with their feedback would definitely recommend this course	4

this course helped me in a very turbulent period of my life i now know what i truly want to be and this course helped me on the way to discover such thing	4
its good	4
this class was well thought out and easy to follow i really enjoyed listening to barbara oakleys presentations with the funny graphics most but terrys ss material was well presented and extremely interesting i look forward to being to implement the lessons from this course in every learning area of my life i highly recommend this for any person interested in learning or teaching	4
very basic introduction to data science the class is wellorganized and suitable for new learners of data science	3
it was really helpful educating course thank to university of stanford and thank to mr andrew ng	4
i learned a lot about bootstrap in this course	3
i wasnt being fair on my review it was my mistake that i didnt see this is a part of a bigger course i feel like it doesnt deserve  stars because the way the exercises were made didnt help me retain information i feel like the students should do more	3
excellent coursenice course for beginners to learn programming	4
i found this course to be very informative and impacting too bad i could only audit it and not purchase the course to earn the certificate	4
the best way to meet programming as a discipline for the first time сharismatic teacher useful assignments wellthoughtout course thank you charles severance and coursera team	4

great course good videos the assignments are challenging and the concepts clear perfect 	4
this course cover all the basic fundamentals require for machine learningdoing assignment before this were never interesting i am enjoying the assignment part	4
this course really helped me a lot	4
the course is excellent great quality of supplied material teachers and assignments i rate it on the fact that i was able to follow it and learn quite a lot on a subject that is far from easy and im pleased with the resultsthe only issue  recommendation i can point out  the course is not very specific on the needed background as an example i took this course being an engineer with a decent understanding of maths a lessdecent understanding of physics almost no quantum physics background and experience with python programming in my case it required a lot of effort in order to follow some of the chapters specially the ones focused in quantum physics and normally always more than the normal  hsweek i recommend the student to have some background on probability theory  functions and python programming so as to follow easier and expect some difficulty in fully understanding some of the subjects i still rate it  stars	4
great course	4
just reading the materials	0
great course with engaging material and enthusiastic and experienced instruction the materials lectures assignments extras links etc were excellent only two negative aspects occurred the first was the initial lack of materials with which to follow the instructors as they went through various processes in arcmap in their lectures however this was remedied quickly and materials were provided the second was the instructional material for the week  assignment which lacked the stepbystep detail and polish of the assignments from other weeks this may have been due to the course being new and somewhat unrefined overall the course was extremely helpful and well worth the time and money i intend to continue on and complete the entire specialization	3
started out a bit slow with material that i felt was somewhat extraneous but then got to the good part hard part of installing r and getting it working with git	3
great course	4
this is an wounder full course its very sad that i can afford it for certificate but if you can u should go for itdont wait dont think just go for it	3
i generally think the course needs a lot of improvement as after week  the assignments and quizzes dont seem to relate to the course content we are at very different levels so a more gentle easing and explanation of ideas is necessary other than this apparent quantum leap from one stage to the next i have had to do a different course else where and i am getting the sort of good introduction into the r language its not practical to expect everyone to understand the ideas in  weeksprogramming is hard enough as it is	0
it is an excellent course perfect to enter the wonderful world of programming for ios applications	4
its one of the best courses ive ever take	4
it was an awesome course i learned so much thank you	4
this is a really practical and interesting course that i enjoyed i would recommend it to anyone who is serious about learning	4

hi team i just had one feedback on the course content that there were some princip	2
too easy	2
awesome course	4
for me it is easier to grasp algorithms that are written out than audiovideo description i would have given  stars if the course material accommodated different learning styles for each chapter i had to do a fair amount of searching for information on the a star search algorithm to the understand the subtle details	3
this course will be very help for me in my masters track since i am doing master in this field so i want to study all the topic in more detail furthermore the course is helpful for me in my career development	4
i really learned a lot about diplomacy this course is very wellstructured	4

very productive course for building web sitethe professors handson style teaches how to actually explorehope this will be a permanent course for my children to come to learn	4
great course	4
the lecture  interview approach brings diversity and different views on the table the topic of the mooc is actually quite simple and its its simplicity that makes it so important  first thought for the large majority of entrepreneurs should be to raise money by their own means ie building a sellable product and finance the business through customers the fact that it isnt so nowadays is the reason for so many failures and its also why this course is so relevant	3
kickstarted me into using graphs in r	4
i like the course very much because it is not just completely understandable and logical structuredbut it gives a lot of useful advices thank you	4
it is a good general overview about recruiting but i would like more information about staff planning as well how to forecast the workforce needs	2
i think the way it is taught is not very insightful the lecturers clearly just read a script and make it difficult to follow they assignment questions are often hard to understand most importantly there is very little about the actual mechanism behind pricing financial instruments instead they just state the formula	0
weel done great training	4
its a very complete course with a lot of detail and valuable information for me it has two parts one very technical and the other that is more into the spiritual meditation and techniques i think it was worth the time and effort thanks a lot	4

incredible course the material taught and discussions held where practical and applicable to the real world situation today	4

best course for beginners in marketing field 	4
useful information thank you very much for the opportunity to learn	4
very good course 	4
well presented and thought provoking	3
i really enjoyed this course an interesting mix of history philosophy and psychology i enjoyed the written assignments as it made me think harder about the course material than just passing the quizzes reviewing others work was fascinating too as it made me consider things from different points of view though i do think the reviewing criteria wouldve benefitted from being just a little bit more detailed to better reflect the huge variation in standard between submissionsim very much looking forward to the next module	4
sometimes the lessons wanted to cover a lot of topics in a small frame of time so it may be hard to follow up with everything without a background in general psychology i absolutely loved the compendium of different scientific studies each week overall it is a great approach as an introduction but it may fall short if you want to go deeper nonetheless i would highly recommend it	3
had a blast i have no background in ml whatsoever but the tools concepts and exercises presented is really interesting and really help set the mood for the rest of the specialization	4
great class	3
very very intuitive and insightful course i got a lot out of it thanks andrew and coursera team	4
best course if youre new to ml	4
awesome course for people who want to start learning python thank you	4
basic but good knowledge	3
good course but very highleve	2
i liked the course a lot what i could wish for is additional smaller assignments that test parts of the learnt theory as well as the current assignments this would make the learning process more intuitive	4
love the brevity and intuitive explanation of each lecture course structure is well paced and structured	4
one of the best course in machine learning thanks andrew ng	4

it is very interesting and useful course	4
the enthusiasm of the instructors was the best thing about this class but i really wanted a more rigorous methodology  and didnt really get it here but it was an alright introduction to machine learning but not enough if you want to know what makes the black box work	2
fun and interesting course i learned a lot despite already being a live user reviewing the assignments of other coursetakers widened my horizons and helped me gain valuable insights	4
nothing can be better than this	4

one of the best structured intro course on plato and presocratics	4
great info about photography very easy to digest	3
the course is very good for new poeple on javascript and programming in general but its tedious for people who who a bit of js or have a programming background as it goes on to talk about very basic stuff like variables and arrays anyone with  months experience in software know this conceptsi suggest you add that this course is for the real noobies of js or programming in general	3
its a great course with useful information would be even better if it was a little bit longer and more informative anyway it definitely give some foundations about personal finances thank you	3
very helpful and useful information would definitely recommend it as i did	4
essential class for really anybody not only students	4
neatly planned with excellent information	4
thoroughly enjoyable with all the different lecturers  i related to a lot of philosophers  made me wish i could belong to an era where i could make use of all that was learnt and discovered and theorized at that time it was rather brief  though i mean theres no way to explain it all an stick to the guidelines that fit the coursera code  but enjoyable none the less makes you really want to scratch your brain and question everything  which i personally  believe is always a good thing	3
an introductory course to this contemporary technologic phenomenon which merges you inside the very basis of internet functioning and how iot devices have been evolving and diversifying how we can understand and conceptualize them disassembling existing ones conceptually and learning the basic ideas on why and how to design an iot device	4

programming for everybody getting started with python helped me familiarize with basics of python in less than  hours i have a programming background the interactive interface along with course materials kept me involved throughout and it was over before i knew it dr chuck is awesome	4
i found the video lectures less helpful with this course than the quantitative course and resorted to reading the transcripts in order to learn the important information i did enjoy the assignments  observation and interview processes and found the application helped better understand the theory	2
extremely interesting but could be more detailed showing more specific data and examples with downloadable spreadsheets	3
i recommend this course to be provided early along the genomic data science specialization probably before genomic data science with galaxy as it would help make the later one much more easier to understand	4

the best course ever for people who are interested in machine learning or people who need to advance in this field	4
the course information was great and the assignments were very helpful what lost points for the course was not the content provided by wesleyan which was good but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques for each assignment i had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing sometimes more there should be a way to rate critiques so that students cant move on if they dont do the work of critiquing well	2
fundamental and detailed 	4
a very well organized and presented course with relevant content	3

it was a very interesting course especially for those who are not english native speakers i learned a lot	4
its an awesome course where one can learn a lot it is well structured and andrew ng does a fantastic job in teaching i enjoyed the course very much and would recommend it to everyone interested in machine learning	4
excelent course and instructors	4
given the importance of this subject this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as glm or model selection techniques	2
great course the lecture about actors that were mentioned in the beginning of week  would have been a nice addition	4
great	4
this is a great starter course for materials informatics it covers a good amount of topics and uses a nice case study to reinforce digital representation of data spatial correlations principal component analysis and regression i really liked the examples of pymks my only suggestions is it would have been nice to have more handsons use of pymks and scikit learn this could have been accomplished through a course project or homeworks	3
really amazing course	4

very accessible thank you	4
interesting approach and good overview of the long history and development of the western way of wara bit of a gap between the long historical development lines up until ww and the the last lectures about more recent events	4
assignments are very easy and there arent easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos	2
this course would be much better if there was some actual substantive content this course was not worth 	0

dr heather has done an outstanding job to create this unique material with a fine combination of theoretical and practical aspect of spark she has covered almost everything from basic to complex but there is some area which demands more time from the creator for its explanations since this is first time launched course and definitely going to improve itself in upcoming days i enjoyed this course thoroughly it helped me cementing my basic concept of spark	3
the topics that were explained very lucidly and clearly the realworld examples helped develop an intuitive understanding of the course material however i think more topics could be covered in an additional few weeks	3
learned a lot very well covered material	4
motivated	4
this was painful the videos were so terrible in explanation clarity and relevance that i ended up going to youtube to watch the topics and other websites to read the content relevant to the subjects this must be improved	1

this course was invaluable to me in teaching best practices for learning i consider myself a lifelong learner and have been seeking useful techniques for learning difficult material and retaining new material i didnt take to any suggestions from a previous informal study habits minicourse and for over a decade i just resigned myself to not being intellectually able or disciplined enough to tackle certain subjects but professor oakleys teachings encourage me to mount and master learning mountains this was a fantastic course and i have already recommended prof oakleys work to others	4

the course gave a good overview of r language the knity gritty things could have been explained better  for example the result of splitting a data frame does nor return a data frame etcit wasnt for some one who had never programmed in his life	3
just following a text book without an added value from the lectures	0

great course very helpful for practical use	4
great course	4
i kept expecting the colonel to pop around saying no no stop that its silly dthis course was tons of fun and the lecturer is suitably goofy with his examples i loved the randomness and learned quite a bit if youre thinking about game development but youre not sure where to start then give this a go its an entrylevel course and there is a lot of lessons on c programming which is  of the course if you know c then the lessons dealing with the fundamentals of c programming might feel a bit tedious but the examples are fun so you wont mind learning about these things againi liked this course you can see he enjoys what he does which makes you enjoy it as well and helps you learn more	4
exceptional course emily went into great details of the regression algorithms and its application thoroughly enjoyed it	4
great python course for beginners who has no computer science background however the assignments are too easy for anyone who has programming experience it would be better if this course can offer more coding assignments and more challenging questions	4
this course is really helpful for people who wants to change their eating habits for the best this course will teach you how to make first step to healthy food	3

i wish i was exposed to this kind of information in my first year of university nonetheless its definitely still relevantmany thanks to all those involved in preparing this course	4
great course	4
excellent content and a simple manner but effective to transfer the knowledge of the issues	4
classes are amazing exercises could be a little bit tougher	3
overall i thought this course was designed well and did a good job of communicating serious information while staying mostly light i think the professors could use a little more experience presenting this sort of thing as some of the videos were kind of awkward but this is a new style of teaching so i dont really fault them i would recommend this course to most people who have an interest in how the human brain works	3
i felt that the information in this course was very helpful but that the modules were a little redundant it seemed that  weeks of material was stretched into  so that theory could be one course and practice could be another i am in the midst of practice now so my opinion may change and this may not be a fair assessment	3
great course simple and engaging	4
great course	4
brilliant overview many thanks to the teachers for designing such a comprehensive overview this course must be followed by all the others in the specialization for best understanding	4
help me improve my knowledge of how to learn and now i can learn many things more faster than before i love this course	4
awful course the lectures in no way prepare you for the final assignment which is supposed to take two hours the course consists of really boring videos of the instructor using galaxy and in no way teaches you anything about using galaxy or how it works the lectures and quizzes are a joke you can pass the quizzes just by watching the videos i got to the final assignment and had no clue what to do if you i know nothing about bioinformatics or ngs which is why i took and paid for this stupid course so i spent weeks on the final assignment and i still could not finish or pass the course whoever allows this course to still exist and waste peoples time and take their money should be ashamed of themselves read the discussion forums and youll see what im talking abut do not take this course	0
wonderful class	4
most effective course thanks a lot	4

very informative	4
good beginner course	4
i would have liked some more depth in the course while the course name says punctuation it deals only with commas and to a small extent with semicolons the assignments and practice exercises need to be tougher also given that this course is taken by students from all over the globe it should mention that the serial comma is not mandatory in all writing styles	2
excelent material great videos great motivation and a great teacher	4
wonderful class i learned so much from the instructors here that i just want to reach out and hug them  thank you so much for this opportunity	4
thanks to coursera and university of arazona for this great course i enjoyed it so muchit will be of a great help for my careerspecial thanks to the instructors	4
excellent course about game development introduction it will be nice if they include achapter about mobile game	3
this is a very good course if you are considering a career in graphic design it does not concentrate a lot on the technique but rather on the creative process and the theory the assignment are not too intense yet very helpful in giving that exposure to the role of the graphic designer i definitely recommend it if you are a beginner or even if you already know some techniques but want to learn more about the theoryalso throughout the course you get very valuable recommendations for further readings i found that very helpful	4
many problems and mistakes found in the assignment programs and i felt a lack of staff assistance on helping solving them	1
very good course for beginners explanations are short and concise and very clear dont know how part  is organized but i think it would be nice to have also an introduction to cadcae softwares like inventor or solidworks and to solve some of the examples with those softwares so people is aware of the existing numerical possibilities	4
thank you very much for the great course	4
logically structured and well paced	4
excellent course andrew ng is truly a great lecturer who turns complicated ml problems into easytounderstand examples even for a person without cs background like me	4
excellent course comprehensive material good classes	4
i would like a different approach on the way this course is given to the student the first couple of classes were really cool and inspiring but the later two became more of the same and kinda took my inspiration and motivation down to finish the course	2
excellent learning opportunity	4
best and nicest instructor ever	4
it is really good and worth the time	4

it was a privilege listening to this passionate and clear guide through the history of technology and antitrust with all the relevant docs  each time i finished a segment i could not help listening to the next one like in a good tv series	4
astounding overview of life	4
good introrefresher for someone with no or very little programming knowledge	4
thanks for this excellent course i am a doctor and in  i have completed my mph in epidemiology from bsmmu bangladesh but for some reasons i have a gap in last  years in my career and recently i have started working with an epidemiologist in nui galwayireland and looking for something which would help me to remind all those things i had learnt  years back this course works like a magic now i got my memory back both teacher are very kind and they tried to make it easier for all which made this course fascinating best wishes for alldr sabrina zarin	4
i think the course met my expectations  its super highlevel and does not at all go over the underlying algorithms involved i give it  stars because i have this feeling like this specialization is an underhanded way to sell the dato graphlab create product theres a bit of a conflict of interest going on here	3
in itself interesting content structure was difficult to follow and the history  in my humble view  was going back too far into the past whereas more recent developments where only touched at the surface quality of slides was poor	2
the course is great as an introductory course to metaanalysis i feel like i know a lot more about metaanalysis now	3
very good course i learned a lot of knowledge especially in cloud services which is the most updated tech in the world	4
only just started this course but already enjoying it very much	4
pretty good course where you learn how to analyse performance via various statistical analysis techniques you also learn quite a bit in ms excel	4
it will be better adding examples related with engineering cases this is for technical people in any branch of engineering	3
good explanation to the core components	4
it was amazing this course s very enjoyable and interesting if u want to know about nutrition	4
the programming assignments are challenging  atleast for beginnerswith each question taking about  hours to complete many topics in pandas are covered  making us reading the docs and finding solutionsthat further helps in learning  excellent course  good support from other learners taking the course and very very informative  no other platform can give us a course  and knowledge  of this standard  planning to take more courses from courseera  however a small feedback  the description for some questions are slightly confusing  please make such questions more descriptive with examples 	4
it make me to know more	4
a clear explanation of the topic very useful background on sql and intro to sqlite	4
very good but slightly basic great starting point	2
this course has great content and i believe the professor is very knowledgeable about this subject matter however at times it can be very difficult to understand what he is saying i believe he knows the english language very well but between his deep accent and speaking very quickly there are a number of times i cannot understand what he is saying this is reflected at times when reading the transcript below each video i found it better to slow the video down to x the regular speed to hear him but that did not remove all of the difficulty	2
the content in this course is wellstructured and wellpresented topics are broken into short digestible segments that are narrowly focused and thoroughly explained including relevant examples quizzes and assignments reinforce the critical aspects of the lectures	4
best coursera containt  highfive andrew ng	4
i learnt many things i already started to use i also like very much chapters on system design and diagnosis	4
the classes were pretty good but the bibliography was not the bibliography consists of encyclopedias articles which are not necessarily written to a beginner it is quite discouraging for someone starting with philosophy to read articles which lacks a pedagogic approach	2
a very good course but not as good as the first two in this specialisationit could do with a bit of editing and strengthening the last  exercisesother than this dr chuck is an excellent teacher and great fun to follow	3
i had a great learning experience	4
great course	3
not for the faint of heart but this course does a really good job of explaining clustering and retrieval of images and text it includes several programming assignments which can be tackled with minimal programming experience if one perseveres	4
good understanding on energing concepts experiences from scandanavian countries and gets me exploring possibilities in our environment cities	3
very good introduction course thanks	3
a great online course while taking this facinating course i have found myself discussing the content with several of my friends which is normally not possible when studying such geeky topics you will get a much better sense of what is possible and what is still not possible how long it takes to implement how to do it etc this is much more useful as an introduction to machine learning than reading a book	4
there is quite a bit of material within this course having the supplementary book and princeton online material helped substantially especially when debugging the assignments	3
very helpful	4
its a great course offering a great quality of work covering everything i needed to know about meetings and how to handle meetings in a great professional way	4
great	4
very informative and systematic but have to pay attention to the terms because it can be quiet difficult for the beginners in this field	4
wholesome experience	4
cant wait for cryptography  excellent course fantastic professor	4
it really explains some fundamental things about learning worth checking it out	4
covers a lot of ground in short time	3
the instructors really had a simple structure throughout which made the course itself interesting and easy to follow along also the few wisecracks here and there are appreciated 	3
this is an excellent course to get to understand the principles of image and video processing however this is not a course to take lightl if your goal is to learn youll spend at least  hoursweek especially between weeks  if you want to get all the juice out of it	3
learning this course gave me confidence and more interest in exploring data science i plan to explore further through the next couple of courses	4
honestly i cannot believe that this course wont allow people to go an extra mile to make something better and learn more than what course was designed for how is it possible that i try to do something different and better than what i was requested to do and because of that i got bad gradings because it was different even though it met the projects requirements i left a complaint and this is the response from one of the mentors john f davis replied all i could say is keep your personal touch in your github and submit the nonpersonal touch version to be gradedhow is this going to allow the students to learn more if they are going to be graded badly if they do if we are not allowed to work on something greater im disappointed with the peer grading system but even more with this kind of attitude from a mentor	1
best course ever very handsond oriented practical example applicable to real life business innovation projects	4
great insights and its a gold for any marketing lover	4
a set of powerful tools for learners	3
excellent very helpful and wellexplain	4

excellent overview of the big data field and its relation to escience	4
great starter for astronomy and cosmology 	4
good course good teacher very usefull thanks	4
awesome some minor errata you manually have to account for here and there but otherwise this course strikes the perfect balance between the technical and the practical in as understandable a manner both to programmers and nonprogrammers alike	4
overall very good perhaps a bit more indepth at some of the subject but i off course understand that it was meant as more of a overview good book	3
the course is really well structured and gives a solid understanding in the latest approaches in machine learning however i would also like to see in this course more sophisticated math because it matters and i think there are important	4
very nice one may be not the one for a beginner but help to gain some basics	3
wonderful course thank you professor biss	4
the course is well structured and the contents are exposed clearly probably one of the main problems of the subject wind energy itself is it covers many disciplines aerodynamics mechanics and machinery structural design electricity and grid connection financial aspects so a week course had to be quite superficial to cover each of this aspects minimally for my expectations it was a little bit too simple but mostly the quizzes were too easy the hints after the quizz questions were solving the questions and avoiding the beautiful part of the quizzes playing with the formulae and interiorizing itall in all it was a nice enjoyable course but sadly i feel i didnt get deep enough in many of the treated subjects even for an introductory course	2
i have absolutely no idea how could this become a separate course  and one spread over  weeks it is extremely basic extremely general and extremely high level it should be compressed to  hours and added as an _optional prerequisite_ to other courses in this specialization i personally feel cheated out of my  usd star	0
its a really helpful class that will help beginners in machine learning its easy to understand and is taught in a very efficient way	4
excellent introduction for this topic	4
progress is a bit too slow	3
im in week   cant master data analysis in excel	0
very helpful in acquiring necessary knowledge about live i would recommend this course to several others like me interested to get their hands on ableton	3
covers the basics well	3
this course gives in a fun and easy way practical tools for studying more effectively share with us successful experience of others and general knowledge of our brainwith only little effort you can become a better student and a better mentor to others	3
great course  the problem sets were challenging and appropriate for the learning goals for participants who have not been exposed to significant mathematical coursework the mathematical notation may be intimidating at first but is not an insurmountable obstacle	4
good introduction of a few essential key concepts	4
an amazingly deep dive for an intro course covers generics pattern matching immutable data structures in lectures week  had some issues with the grader robot and exponential run times if you wrote some bad code	4
the material is interesting however there is not enough information provided by the course to effectively implement the algorithms in the allotted time of each weeks assignments it relies on deferring to external reading materials as primary sources and these resources were not specified in advance to secure copies in a timely manneradditionally there is a big disconnect between the knowledge provided by the weekly material and what is required to easily do the programming assignments in the suggested time of  hoursoverall the course material needs to provide more background material to be more effective in delivering the knowledge expected each week this may be an artifact of trying to cram what other online course provide in  weeks down into  weeks if the intention is to give a flavor in  weeks then the material needs to be distilled down into more of a cookbook format	2
this was a very good introduction to python	4
really inspired cursus	4
thank you so much dr charles severance	4
this is a truly unique course covering an essential but largely neglected part of human nature and history	4

great course loving the experience of programming	4
this is an excellent course well designed with historical examples	4
this course was very boring and very frustrating long long slow lectures with lots and lots and lots of questions and no answers the briefest of comments on potentially interesting people or topics but no links to enable those to be followed up quizzes on concepts not covered in the material conflicting descriptions of assessment requirements discussion moderators who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for before taking this course i could find only one negative review which i dismissed as probably being a minority having taken the course i agree with that review wholeheartedly i did learn a couple of things despite everything but i would not recommend this course please upgrade it substantially	0
great for all languages	4
its a great course	3
i thought i knew a bit about genetics  evolution when i enrolled but the first genetics lecture showed that i was wrong prof noor has taught me a lot about genetics he is an engaging and inspiring lecturer it is also obvious to me that he takes a keen interest in the students as he has been quick to reply to questions that i have asked in the forums im looking forward to the evolution lecturesi am not sure why i enrolled for this course since i was sure i already knew the material but i am glad that i did i recommend the course if you belong to any of the following categories people who think they know the subject people who dont think know it but are interested everybody else because i think you will find prof noor inspiring	4
it was not challenging could raise the difficulty a little	2
great course makes it easy to understand basic concepts and algorithms of most popular ml methods through program assignments methods like logistic regression svm and neural networks become easy to comprehend and are not a black box anymore	4

thank you to university of michigan and its professors scott derue and maxim sytch this has been one of the best online courses i have ever attended the course brings into picture a lot of ideas and strategies to help evaluate develop and motivate your teams	4
unfortunately i found this course to be the least enjoyable so far in the specialization im not sure if i was just jarred by the change in instructor but i found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling im not sure if shes a mother or not but thats the way she comes acrosslike shes trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten yearoldsa majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class and she would often list things she was going to talk about and then ignore one of those items entirely in fact one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map something that was mentioned in the lectures but not gone into in depth at all i tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logicalultimately im very disappointed with this part of the specialization i dont feel like it was worth my  and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning ux designer to learn and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth	1
the instructors presentations are so irritating due to him acting in a jumpy nervous and hyperexcited manner that i could not stand watching the lectures if you dont mind that its probably not a bad course	1
very useful and awarness course before starting this course i thought waste management is a simple thing but now i am able to understand the effects of its open dumping an treatment proces	3
this is a really great course its broadened my scope of music a lot i never use to think much of jazz and blues but ive really got an appreciation for it now 	4

marketing analytics in theory was much more enriching than this one it would be great if tutors can add practical examples to show how marketing analytics is actually performed it would have been great	2
its a truely amazing course having studied so much econometrics from undergraduate to phd i still learnt so much from this regression course this course teaches me regressions in a way that is very different from any economicsbusiness schools i have ever attended while it is technically less demanding than most econometric courses from second year ug onwards it is the appliedpractical nature of this course that makes it so valuable	4
good class not much different than the arduino one useful to learn and use ssh with linux if you do not have a monitor for your raspberri pi	4
great content but animations are annoying	2
auditing is pretty useless with how this class is updated i cant get peer reviews so my assignments get zero feedback coursera didnt used to be like thisasked about how to be more involved in class discussions and peer reviews a couple days ago and havent received feedback	0
this is one of the best courses i have ever taken it is fun and yet it is very detailed and yes it takes a bit more than  hours per weekyou will learn much more than using tableau you will learn to ask the right questions and you will also learn how to present your data analytics results to the csuite or whoever asked for iti highly recommend this to anyone beginners and experienced business  data analysts	4

very informative course and proper lectures and presentations prepared which makes it enjoyable for a learner	4
i felt it was mainly fun and i did talked about the principles and interviews ive seen during the course so i guess something about the course works also it helped me understand some of my behaviors for good and bad there are a few things that were a bitwellmade me go somewhere else for a while during the courseit took me a while to get used to the lectures tempo for me  they are a bit too slowin many cases  the answers for the question were long from time to time  it was really exhausting	4

quite useful for introducing data science i will now enroll in the data science specialization	4
this course is life changing	4

great course	4
the goodvery palatable content and provides information at a very slow pace for ease of learningmore reasonable content and far more worthwhile than the first arduino course of the seriesthe badnot worth the money when looked at generally the first and second course could easily have been merged a lack of introduction to electronic circuits also hinders full use of what is being taught	2
are you a procrastinator participate in this course when you should be doing your real classes or workeven if youre an expert in all the latest productivity hacks youll learn the biological reasons behind such subjects as putting things off and why you may not be learning even though youre covering all the materialonce completed you can apply what youve learned and get down to more efficient learningadditionally it seems that the professors do a good job of keeping the course updated and communicating to students	4

i totally enjoyed the course and it really opened up my mind to think in new ways absolutely recommended to take this course	4
its very helpful thank	4

great fundamental information of hospitality	4
this is a very interesting and enjoyable course that gives great reading materials supplementary to the main materials thank you to the course team the key problem with the course design is the peer marked review system for the final assignment in the language of the course there is no intrinsic motivation to peers to mark correctly or with any effort leading to inappropriate marking practices	3

the excercises on the course are great but the videos can be a little vague	2
the fundamentals like the title says very well explainei wish there was more info on what software to use for the assignments for those of us more used to traditional mediums rather than digital	3

interesting and informative perfect combination of lecturers information and amazing views look forward to water resources management and policy 	4
a fair chance to broaden thank you all for the travel	4
with all due respect to the lecturer its obvious that he is intelligent and an expert on the subject i found this lesson not easy to participate because of inordinate learning curve and fast accent	0
this is really a great course thanks yaakovi am zero start with angularjs but through this course i think that i really get a lot and by passed every assignment that i can also use angularjs wellso it is a right choice get start from this course  yaakov always offers high quality coursesthanks yaakov again	4

its really goodi have learn the useful way to change my study	4
everything is clear to know and learn everything to start implantology the course is too a guide to explore more about implantology with a guidelines of research because in this surgical discipline we have never finish to learn in dentistry everything go fast and we must stay connected whats news  whats protocol is better  and what we must to do or stop actually with the data acquired from science in fact this course its an amazing guidelines but we dont never stop to learn more about all of subject in implantology thank you to all great and amazing speakers who have try to give us the best information that we need to start implantology or to confirm what we now it seems to be difficult to resume all keys factors of each course in one video thank you all ill stay connected now with university of honkkong dr hans helder boussamba k gabon  central africa	4
pretty good course while the assessments are pretty much just a repeat of the invideo questions i feel i was still able to learn a fair amount	3
this was a great course  a fantastic introduction to marketing research and consumer behaviour  packed with good info delivered in an easy to follow way	4
a very well explained course on how to break down decision making purely on rational and analytics  this course did not explain strategy in a higher level it only explained in systematic decision making scenarios	4
for me this class was a fantastic introduction to the wonderful world of moocs not only was the content welldelivered and dynamic with a variety of speakers short and easily manageable video lectures great discussion forum topics and a wealth of optional supplemental materials but i really appreciated how the experience was organized as a first time moocer uncertain of how much time i could dedicate to my learning schedule i appreciated the three level track system that allowed me to allot my time accordingly as desired and able  the mere existence of learn engage and go deeper tracks reassured me that i could get the required work done and explore further at my leisure in fact i tended to get through all the levels but i appreciated the opportunity to customize my learning experiencea great introduction to an important concept and a superb overview of philosophy psychology and sociology  none of which i have studied in depth before excellent course for the beginner all the way to the advanced student i have already registered for the followups on science and practice to be launched this summer and fall really well done	4
very interesting course that provides a very insightful overview of the international energy issues i like the way it is structured and how much of valuable information is given taking into account relatively not big time commitment i work in the electric power industry and i find information that i have learned during this course to be very helpful for my general understanding of the international energy issues	4
great basics and intro to following courses	4
very good and thorough course everything is explained to the root so for all the things you learn you learn why you are learning this how it is used and in which situation you would us it i did have some previous experience from taking a computing science master but i thought the difficulty level was perfect you have to think about it but there is enough explanation to make everything cleari enjoyed it	4
excellent course but good for the beginners  after this you can will have much knowledge to take any advance course related machine learning	4
cover very broad range of topic	4
helpful well organized make you curious about whats going on in later course	4
teacher is so goodsand so enthusiasm	4
great and excellent thoughts and course material	4
very nice and well organised enjoyed a lot thanks a lot very helpful	4
python all the way baby	4
very clear and helpful to understand the energy market	4
learned a lot from this class greatly enjoyed the content	4
its very informative for the fresh studentscourse content is explained very clearly	3
i would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in getting a thorough albeit rapid introduction to financial accounting professor marc badia has a gift for deconstructing dense material into digestible bits through concise weekly videos the quizzes and final project are all very applied in naturewhile we all learn differently i cant stress enough the importance of taking meticulous notes each week	4
this course has some very distinct and informative material which was terrific for learning about writing for young readers i particularly found maria gills modules very informative encouraging and well presentedwhat i found really disheartening was that we as students who arent qualified and at times have questionable english literacy skills were the ones who were given the task of assessing all of the assessments in this course i was really hoping for feedback from the industry experienced course creators   the other thing that was frustrating is that word count was a criteria some students were brutal in their grading because one was over the word count by a few words so be aware of that if you are going to undertake this coursethis is not so much a course which leads to some sort of exam or qualification dictionarycambridgeorg but an independent information acquirement experiencei learnt quite a lot about writing and publishing and would encourage you to do this course as it does contain some great information and tips just be aware that grading is based on newbies like us and sometimes the feedback can be a bit disheartening but just persevere and you will learn lots these people really know what they are talking about	3
nice usefull knowledge	4
good but nowhere near as indepth as some of the other courses found on coursera	2
liked the way course is organized posing questions at the beginning of each lecture is a great idea	4
fantastic course  great content very informative and engaging presentations	4
professor shapiro is one of the finest instructors who have chosen to offer their courses on coursera his knowledge is deep his ability to explain and clarify subtle concepts is superior and the manner in which he teaches the material covered is sound to have the chance to hear his tutorial is a real opportunity that anyone who has interest in the study of political or political ethics should not miss a fine course bravo	4
insight after insight  great course	4
this course needs no previous knowledge about the field the instructor takes you from the scratch	3
very good course thanks to it i got an interest in developing my skills in data analysis further	4
excellent course to start with  it was a pleasure doing all the assignments and watching all lectures	4
would like to have seen more material using git and git bash commands more repetition here would be helpful seems like a lot of this information will be lost or forgotten when it comes time to use it especially as it relates to the data science specialization	1
the teacher was rather informative he analyzed the subject to its detail i am very satisfied	3
lots of theory but includes some useful models and formulas	2
wonderful lectures great chuck	4
life changing literally i am an unorganized artist and this has already been a benefit to my personal life and business	4
as for me too much water id like to have this course shorter and faster	3
excellent course this course will have a positive impact in your daily activities and also in you professional duties	4
i love finance and i love how the instructor teaches it very thorough	4
if you are trying to understand what is a research and how to do one this is the perfect start	4
i think that presentation slides should be offered to students these slides will cointain information that is given by the expositor also it is possible to offer a toolkit pages in each module to faciltate teaching	2
ive never taken biology before although i had to google lots of terms i understood the concept and that was all i wanted great videos	4
fun class great introduction to programming with the arduino	4
very good  well distilled and concise	3

awesome i learnt a lot special thanks to professor and his staff	4
great	4
wonderful base for machine learning enthusiasts prof ng delves deep into various subtleties which are only glossed over in todays world where ppl rush to packages like tensorflow to build quick prototypes but then struggle to understand whats going on under the hood  debug their ml programs highly recommended kudos  thanks to prof andrew ng	4
excellent course intimidating at the beginning but very well taught with little knowledge of mathlinear algebra quite steep learning curve very good professor excellent practical examples and assignments	4
helps a lotthanks for professor and this platform	4
to the point and with excellent real world data to train on your assignments	3
some lectures are just right for the public in general but most of them seem to be built from common sense theres where i wonder if the american people are so unliterate on food issues the quality of the visual material is also variable i am sure that including animation of more appealing graphics would be helpful to engage more people into the course another challenge would be to prepare more challenging content	0
good course to set foundation	4
was really helpful and the structure of the course is good	4
this is an excellent course it has been designed accurately for professionals who want to get the esl teaching certificate i enjoyed learning about the language foundational principles lectures theories teaching techniques etc	4
its really helpful for me 	4
the course is nicely paced i was able to go through all the videos and assignments within a day or twoprof yaakov chaikin is very skilled and makes his videos fun to watch it is amusing as well and educational really liked the videos about the restaurant visit and how to talk to a customer and what to expect and how to deal with issues in the process	4
nice course but need more syllabus to be included	4
wonderful course  amazing way to present it in very simple format  got to learn true meaning of love gratitude  micromoments it gave me new perspective about positivity  instead of being positive in every situation  which is not possible in many situations  being open in any situation really worked for me to be more resilient while living my imperfectly perfect life 	4
very good material very good neoj hands on for new comers the critique goes to the coverage of graphx hands on which at least to me is not explained clear enough	3
very good course about security especially if you are looking for details about the lowlevel of c and c	4
excellent course mini projects teach you a lot	4
i feel there are many more topics to discuss for this course i also feel that the topics discussed could be examined in further detail and at a slower pace and there were times when the speaker was quiet or the microphone didnt work properly and i had a difficult time hearing what was being talked about	1
very interesting i will recomend it	4
this is a great course and i highly recommend it to anyone who is getting ready to begin a new learning path whether it be college a new job or a coursera module this course will help you in understanding a little bit about why your brain does what it does great course	4
i really learned a lot and also that ai is mostly a and not so iprof andrew also rekindled my programming skills	4
this is such an introspective process toward leadership it is illuminating in a personal growth capacity and the ability to relate with others	4
great course interesting and challenging	4
professor ed is very inspiring and engaging he has the best teaching skills	4
very insightful	4
everytime i retake this course it helps me understand the subject more and moreit helps me connect with many things in real world	4
interesting course that i thoroughly enjoyed would recommend	4
way too much videos and too little handson learning felt like the course mostly taught you to remember stuff and not actually learning a skill though i broke the course early	0
a very informative course that is extremely well presented	4
very good overview of wind energy	4
course provided me great insight regarding different dimension of development and what is the appropriate definition of development the least developed countries of today will achieve the status of most developed countries however the cost that environment has paid for the present most developed countries need to be taken care of with a balanced approach the shackles of poverty can only be removed by social inclusion and creating good public policy this course has added a new perspective about sustainable development	4
a different and interesting perspective to look in the field of finance content is little confusing and more of self study component but overall its worth	3
i loved the first three weeks for the really well presented background information weeks  and  did not give me any further interesting knowledge i also missed lectures on qpcr ngs and other molecular methods for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes as these methods are up and coming overall thank you for setting up this course	2
awesome course i hope institution will provide more similar courses like this one	4
very good teacher since i am a choral conductor i specially appreciated the interviews and advies from the choral conductor picked up quite a few points i was surprised to learn that dr feldman let his players sing their partsi will definitely recommend this course	3
a great course on social thinkers	4
i am liking a lot what i see great course  thank you	4
it makes sense to learn the course which helps me learn more efficiently	4
very good explanations and the exercises and power points prepared helped to understanding it better thanks	4
this is a good overview to r programming though the lectures leave much to be desired at least for a programming beginner watching the videos left me confused about key concepts which i absorbed much better through the swirl interactive exercises the discussion forums and other examples online of course we are supposed to be hackers but i enjoyed this course much more once i just turned off the video read through the slides and focused on other areas where i could learn the conceptsalso the discussion forums were great for helping with key issues and the homework assignments were also outstanding for making sure you absorb and apply concepts so its worth taking  just keep in mind the videos may not be for everyone	3
a quite good and complete course to understand the basics of astrophysics and planetary science	4
very good course but lectures could be more tuned onto the home assignments a lot of independent work for me at least teacher is very good	3
excellent course thanks	4
very helpful course that can help improve your life on many levels	4
i really loved the course  it helped me greatly to gain an overall idea of the aspects of machine learning at the outset itself without confusing me with intricate details of the course and yet introducing to everything in there at a glance really keeps you hungry for more 	4
 points out of  for professor peter  point out of  for professor mike the first  weeks were good as professor peter presented with very brief and sum up the ideas on another hand the last  weeks were bad professor mike didnt do well in term of summary he spent  for introduction of each topic before reaching to the points that he want to make most of the time he didnt make any points plus he didnt answer the questions that he asked i am disappointed i was expecting to learn more as the course structure was impressive but the actual lectures are not covered the topic	1
great course i always want to lean	4
really helpful worth to this course	4
interesting and really well done	4
excellent course and teacher congratulations	4
in my humble opinion this course does not have a correct balance of difficulty of new conceptstools with the exercises given by the course to practice it is a hey look there is something called pandas out there that may be very useful for you but it is too introductory and i know the course has the word introduction in the title but that does not grant in my opinion to run a week course such as this one with so little content	2
this part i liked less than the first less substance and i do not like somebody replacing mr odersky as a lecturer	3
excellent course will serve you long for any course program and any things you want to learn in life	4
the final assignment is impossible to finish since i have  version in my computer you as the course provider should modify the assignment instead of asking the student to make changes the point is that we are trying to gain some knowledge not wasting time on solving those bugs	0

an absolutely outstanding course nothing else needs to be said	4
i find this course extremely valuable for me even though i finished my studies couple of years ago now i look at the process of studying from different perspective with very well understanding the processes involved in understanding and memorizing things i really recommend this course for everyone	4

great	4
if there had been a working autograder for the last final project this course would have been worth it somehowwhat does that mean the lectures provided valuable information the quizzes generally made sense in relation to the lectures learning how to code wasnt really possiblewhy is that there is only one programming assignment the autograder doesnt give any feedback at all why resp where things go wrong thats everything but good style for software as well as for learning code snippets cant be tested individually thats very bad behavior in programming at the end working code that meets the teached rules is marked as wrong you are lost without any clueso probably you can learn something unfortunately you cant possibly finish the course with a feeling of success	1

great concept much needed	4
the theory and examples are very good and cover a lot of functionalities i like most the questions that pop up in the middle of the videos it is a great way to check whether you understood the conceptssome parts require refinements the questions in the middle of the videos must be synchronized with the content there is a little time gap and the questions in the weekly assignments must be reviewed in depth i dislike wasting a lot of time trying to understanding what is required to answer in each question	3
its very interesting to read all these informations	4

this course has greatly helped my understanding of not only some python but pandas as well my only suggestion to anyone that wants to take this course is to make sure to allocate as much time as possible to it they give estimates as to how long it should take you to complete a weeks worth of material but this can vary highly from person to person overall i enjoyed	3
its sometimes difficult to follow professors beacuse they take for granted information about the examples they use that is not evident for the learners they should take a minute to explain a little bit more what the examples consist of and what are the charts they show as it happens when brian caffo explains the blocking adjustments part	2
john covach is a fantastic instructor i love the combination of trivia music analysis and anecdotes that made the course so fun moreover it feels like he is genuinely a beatles fan like myself it made the experience more special having already done his twopart course on rock history i am looking forward to doing the course on the rolling stones	4

this course is really well introductory while the material presented is interesting the lectures can be quite dull at times  especially later on in the course when substantial time is spent plugging numbers into the same expressions  or  times beginners will probably be better off reading a wikipedia article or any general chemistry textbook for the others setting the playback speed to  improves the quality of the course a lot	2

the informations were useful but the videos were repetitive this whole course had the amount of informations as one week of many others if it was free i would have no complaints but since it is part of a specialization i expect more removing all the fat each week would have  minutes worth of materialalso i did not appreciate the length at which the speakers promoted their books	1

excellent practical application of the knowledge gained chapeau	4
it was a great course mr chuck knows how to teach quality material to the masses i would only suggest that on the programming assignments it would be best if the instructor doesnt write half of the code one reason is that having some of the code written would make that student think that the piece of code provided must be a part of the whole code and as i worked on the programming assignments i realized that much of the code provided wasnt needed in fact it took me longer than necessary to solve the assignments because i kept using the code provided and upon solving the assignment none of the code that was provided was a part of the code i wrote on to the next course data structurethank you coursera and um	4

lots of cutting edge mathematical and computer vision concepts but a serious lack of support no technical staff around to help only one or two examples of how the math works and a general poor explanation of the conceptsthis course is not for beginners and i recommend you steer clear if you do not posses at minimum a bachelors in mathematics	1

great introductory course should be learnt in conjunction with another textbook prof andrew ng covers a lot of concepts some videos though may seem like repetition should be viewed again to understand the concepts advocated by him i have found it very useful to attend live mlai lecturesmeetups and then talk to people about this course and discuss some specific topics it is amazing how much prof ng has covered in the videos and exercises	4
enjoyed the course so much planning to do it again later this year	3

curso bastante básico de ruby on rails	3
this courses material is useful i knew many of things which are pointed here so there was almost nothing new here also i always was an ace student so maybe this course just wasnt impressive enough for  starshowever it featured many many tiny tips and tricks which if mastered can vastly improve learning trough the whole life save time and become more efficient great huhthis courses main material will give you direction and basic most important tips which you will remember however there are many more nuance things which may require additional research memory palace technique for examplei recommend this course for everybody because it obviously will benefit everybody whos determined enough to go through this course and take learning tips into practice	3

good introduction into basic data science tools and a nice starting point for the data science specialization yet the certificate is a little bit overpriced	3
good information but way too short for what coursera charges	2
nice job but somewhat slow in presentation and lumbering the playing on recording to other students for grades is way too cumbersome outside of the necessary downloads recordings playback the course was presented well and scales and position playing were particularly helpful and clear position playing is not as easy as one might perceived and the instructor did a commendable job elaborating and in particular explaining how the information can be used to be creative and improvisethe reason not a  is that the grading is cumbersome and timeconsuming to set up	3

this course is interesting though the main themeie how socrates was a model for much of kierkegaards viewsgets to be a bit redundant also i did not find the final assignment to be as stimulatinginteresting as the course material	3
i think i can understand the more and less of living rooted in a common history the description of life with the elegies and sorrows can be seen in the panel of the arch of titus the most important teaching is positivism in the face of difficult facts and the capacity of the human being to give a different meaning to adversities	4

thank you all for sharing your knowledge thank you dr oakley and dr sejnowski for this wonderfull experience thank you coursera group	4
a lot of the concepts in stats inf  although simple when you think about it and used pretty much every day  i felt were difficult to understand at first wikipedia and some other online sources and youtube videos were more helpful but i think the real issue lay in the teaching style i wont knock mr caffo like some of the others here have because at the end of the day everyone learns differently what works for some might not work for others and unfortunately his style did not suit my learning requirementsmy rating is purely based on the content which i think can be simplified by giving more visual examples i am rating this after taking the regression models course and in that course it is much easier because he gives real time and visual examples of what eg residuals mean or represent just that alone made a huge difference and it then helps me focus on how to write the r code rather than trying to understand the math hope this helps	1
why the assignment of week  and  locked until june  will it really open by then 	4
this course is very helpful	3
very useful	4
simply fantastic tothepoint lectures with great insight to look at problems	4
i really learned many things in this course 	4
as much as i enjoyed completing this course as ive enjoyed every course in this program this one feels less organised than the others simply in that the learning material doesnt clearly connect with the writing material and it was difficult to predict what the review criteria might be i found myself guessing at the meaning of each weeks modules before completing my assignments and more often than not i discovered little correlation between the videos and assignments	2
excellent course on not so easy topic i can not imagine a better way how to teach it	4
very clear and concise	4
a very interesting course thank you	4
excellent course this is a great introduction to hc design and rapid prototyping there is a lot more to learn but the specialization has all the courses needed to get a much deeper understanding the peer assessment of the assignments is a very smart way to make the class more engaging and involved i hope more classes are like this	4

enjoyed week  looking forward to week  believe my review will be five stars by the end of the course am interested in taking more mooc like this in philosophyenjoyed week  looking forward to week  and starting ancient philosophy aristotle and his successors i like the lecture style and can tell susan really enjoys teaching the subjectenjoyed week  looking forward to week  so far plato and socrates make much more sense to me than aristotle but i have only done week  of ari perhaps ari mellows a bit as he gets older lets hope so bjust finished week  great course only sorry that i couldt give it six stars i read that socrates was married to a bit of a dragon who kicked him out of the house every day either to get a real job or so he wouldnt get under her feet while she was doing the housework so philosophy could have started as an alternative to drink or hanging round the bookies all day mind you the drink still got to him in the end no wonder his decision to go for the hemlock was taken so quickly wonder why socrates didnt ask other athenians why they got married if he had all other philosophers since may have been singles with no advice for the rest of humanity on the what why when who where when and how of the logic of the process perhaps aristotle may have the answer see you all on the next stage down the road to discovering the meaning of life ttfn	4

that was an excellent course that reignited my passion for machine learning	4
level of difficulty low	2
well structured course and considerable amount of materials covered thank you	3
overall i really loved this course and taking it from such an important name in the field was cool there were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes unfortunately and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing but still manageable so i dock it a single star also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from hintons courses found online elsewhere on the mobile app many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load not sure if its a problem with the course materials or with the app or with my device so that has not affected my rating for anyone considering this course be advised that ability in calculus and statistics are required for mastery of this material	3
excellent course that explains the basics and the different algorithms and approaches to solve different types of machine learning problems it also goes through a number of applications where machine learning is used and i like the project based approach for programming to reinforce what was learned overall an excellent course and highly recommended	4

a very enjoyable course not as easy as the subject would let you think it is a real preparation in the sense that you get an intensive crash course on basics of hr philosophyhistorytrends and whats to be expected from a managerthe instructor really made an effort to render the course into a mooc format each course is well documented his speeches are clear and each sentence has been carefully selected he summarizes a lot and makes an extra effort to make us understand how each subject is connected to the other i found him a great pedagogas for quizzes you need to understand the subject and not just memorizevery entertaining i sure will watch it again	4

thank you for giving me excellent information on oil  gas industry operationsit is very helpful course for me thank you duke university and coursera	4
the first few weeks are truly beginnerintro course stuff and the entire course is well taught however weeks  ramp up at far too fast of a pace i spent  hours every week trying to keep up and it just moved too fast the instructor was doing things at breakneck speed with little explanation it gets very discouraging by the end because you simply cant play the material i think this course is really for people who are relearning guitar or already have musical backgrounds	0

good overview of the roles and skills needed but loses a little momentum when it gets into the team management side of things which is covered in many other business courses	3
top quality course from top university in the area of taxation	4
this is a very good class assignments get progressively challenging  especially the final lessons but this is what i wanted plan on putting in extra time and getting sore fingers the videos are some of the most professional productions i have seen	4
thanks professor for this great course and thanks to university of illinois for these lectures	4
very good course highly recommended	4
i must say that this is one of the most inspiring eyeopening and lucid courses ive ever taken at coursera while the emphasis is placed on the social and economic factors that shaped the muslim societies thus rendering the religious factor secondary this course provides an alternative lense in understanding the region i particularly like the way the instructor challenges the wellestablished narratives about the region and gives us the empiricalhistorical facts behind the real causes that shaped the muslim world as we know it i have already recommended it to all of my politicallyminded friends and would do so the same for everyone else interested in the region or who wants to better understand the news at least d	4
i have only one feedback the relation between subsequent weeks are not clear it feels like i am learning one technique in week  and then another in week  but why is the technique in week  necessary what are the differences in terms of functionality between the various techniques i think these points are not explained quite clearlygreat course though thank you very much	3
nice and well done teachers are very clear in explaining concepts and examples are useful and helpful	3
i loved this course so much great information	4
very good class and very useful for me thank you very much	4
for the price i felt like i learnt a lot and the way the learning was structured helped me learn quickly and efficiently at the end of each week i was happy surprised how much work could be created in such a short time	4
first part htmlcss are good but js is to fast and hard to follow for the beginners	1
very good course	3
great class	4
thank you for giving me this precious coursei have learned a lot of things from youthank you for your effort	4

a little light but still effective course	2
lots of material covered and very usable	4
really really really good thats why students can learn more and more from here	4
very poor even though for the most part i found the videos engaging the courses overall structure doesnt help to read the novel together as is stated in the title the quizes are poorly written even for me a native russian speaker it was often hard to understand the questions and sometimes its plain guess work on the opinions of the course authors often a required number of answers to pass a quiz is the same as the total number of questions in that same quiz the essays topics rarely correspond with the actual reading of the book for the very first week the essay required knowledge of the book that hasnt been read yet by the participants or it should be stated that one needs to read the book prior to taking the course then again that would require the change of the courses name	0
this course was awesome i love energy and the economics of energy and i still learnt so much 	4
really informativedesigned specially for beginnersthank you	4
great intro course very informative whether youre a horse owner or researching to become one	4
very easy to follow resourceful materials for those looking to build up basic structure of programming logic	4
a good mooc to learn much about the oil  gas industry	4
easy to follow might be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis however the instructors also talk about some frameworks and insights from their experience which could be helpful for even those who have experience	3
just excellent really help me understand and teach to other the fundamentals of graphic design	4
they charge you to take a class that explains how to install a few programs if you go to the programs websites there is directions to install it anyway so this was completely unnecessary waste of money this class should give you some early training on r before throwing it at you in the next course without enough training	0
course material is very good illustrating real world examples need a bit more participation of mentortas in discussion forum	4
an excellent course highly recommendable loved the way the professor explains all the subjects and the assignments are both challenging and entertaining	4
cool course interesting but simple	3
great class and great teacher a course every avid learner should take	4
excellent coursejust a shame trying to figure out to get always the video notes only in english language and not in my natural language currently french detected by coursera which is better to understand questions  insure to get the answer for some videos only the notes in my natural language are available which constraint me to translate and probably leads to misunderstandings	3
the early lectures were profoundly dense monotone and cluttered with noncontextual detail while being strangely given the subject seemingly empty of a real desire to share or convey understanding i am confess that as much as i was looking forward to guest lecturers i couldnt make it past the first three	1
it is a very interesting and welldone course about neurobiology prof sedev has many interactive tasks and he tries to explain details as easy as possible all in all it is understandable	4
i liked these course so much	4
this was a good refresh on	4
information was very good and presented in a clear and intriguing manner i do wish the professors or someone could give some oversight some students were nice but some were very nasty to each other ironically the people with the worst work were the nastiest	3
great course real life examples and great explanations make the learning curve so much more applicable and fun really enjoying the course thanks	4
an excellent course offered by the institutioni appreciate profesor mathias for this wonderful contenti am waiting for the next block of this mooc thanks to the coursera team too	4
its ok worth your time if you are trying to get into philosophy and want part of the proper foundation overall i enjoyed it and it was good as a handhold through the presocratics and some of the most essential platonic writingspros the videos are pretty easy to understand and the material chosencovered is good to knowcons the video quiz questions are reallydulland there are too many a downside of the ease of the videoslectures is that they dont really go that in depth and theyre nowhere near the quality ive seen in other coursera courses like the kierkegaard course from ucopenhagen	2
it was an amazing course  i would recommend it to anyone who wants to go to japan as an international student  it provides many essential information	4
very nice overview of how webdevelopment is done it has been of great help to me for developing basic human machine interfaces for robotic systems	4
pretty good	4
very useful	4
this was one of my first online courses and i think the lecturers did an excellent job of conveying the material especially through this medium they were also quick to respond to any questions that i had about lectures i loved the material they presented as well great course i would definitely recommend it	4
great and insightful introduction to world of machine learning	4
a lot of the assessments for the history section of the course are needless factualitem recall and not very cognitively challenging or engaging the combination of historytechnologysecurity could be more tightly integrated it feels like three discrete courses just merged together into one good material overall just not sure the scalescope is appropriate to one course	3
very interesting and should be extremely useful	4
instructor is just reading out slides hence its not that exciting to watch the lectures just can read through slides to complete it	2
great experience lotof fun awaiting the third volume	4
this was a fantastic course with a realistically attainable amount of material and a humble knowledgable professor whose teaching style makes a normally difficult topic very easy to understand	4
i like the material of the course the interviews but i think it is pretty strict with the answers the ask for in some of the first assessments	2
its very great course for understanding data science	4
i expected more math from an economics course the professor is very good at explaining and demonstrating different topics but it would be very interesting if we see the actual math even in details behind all of these concepts i think most people who take this course have passed calculus  and  so a little bit of math would make it way more interesting and useful	3
i do not recommend you to waste your time planned course activities for a week  just  minute speech of the lecturer telling absolutely banal things and a few questions absolutely useless	0
awesome and a half	3
i loved this course  the subjectmatter was interesting the instructor was endearing and the content was incredibly easytograsp fun and engaging the retrieval quizzes were well spaced out and super helpful for embedding the new knowledge and the expert interviews were great as welltwo potential improvement areas  the videos featuring barbara oakley which was most of them are very lowvolume i had turned up my device speakers and the video player volume adjustor to the maximum levels and tried on multiple devices but it was really hard to hear some of them without straining and having to download the transcripts in order to follow along which meant missed some of her hilarious visuals no audio issues with the other videos or in my other coursera classes  the practice quizzes allow you to see what you got wrong in a given problem and indicated what the correct choice would have been and explained why it was wrong but the actual quizzes dont reveal either this made me feel anxious every time i got a question id gotten wrong on a previous quiz since i didnt know what exactly id gotten wrong or why	4
love the case study based approach where we solve for a particular problem as compared to just learning the techniques and wondering where to implement it	4
came to know some basic research strategies enjoyed the assignments good course catered for grad students but undergrads can also benefit from the reading material provided	2
very impressive the lession gave me lots of insights about how brain work	4
this course is really interesting and motivating even though it has a very short time for a very complex subject the different professors have made their best to give a summary which is as complete as possible being clear and understable at the same timei have used mainly the recommended textbook which i recommend strongly more than the videos but the videos are more than enough to understand every sessionif someone is looking for simple answers to complex questions this is not the course for himher but if you want a quick summary of some of the main views related to different philosophical problems and could be interested in looking for additional information through the recommended bibliography this course could be a very good starting pointthe possible drawbacks in my view would be the lack of discussion forums there is very little time for every philosophical problem it would be really useful to widen the contents of the course using the bibliography mainly the online resources	4
well course	4
you will definitely take with you a lasting impression on how your brain works along with how to treat it so that you could learn more faster getting rid of old habits and incorporating the new habits will take some time and practice the instructors a great and the interviews with those that desire to learn an abundance of information and sharing their experience with you is very inspiringthank you all for allowing me to improve my views on learning and the opportunity of taking a course this rich with content on how to better my thinking power you all are great god bless keep up the work for us and i definitely look forward to contributing one day	4
great class helped with basics	4
the course was very helpful it would have been better if the tutors explained how they have arrived at some values they used like initial weights tolerance threshold etc so that the learning is comprehensive	3
would have been better if quiz access is available for free so that it is easier to reinforce concepts learnt	2
a lot of information well presented and delivered i really enjoyed this course	4
fantastic just want to get that one quiz figured out so i dont loose marks for questions that didnt apply help	3
thank you	3
wonderful introduction to fm comprehensively designed	4
the content of this course is not terribly difficult i thought but its a very good introduction into most aspects of data science you learn to familiarize yourself with r quite well and get a lot of independence to create a final project based on a huge data set one thing i wouldve liked is a sample completed project start to finish to see what was expected the things that got produced which you peer review varied hugely in quality	3
very clear explanation and exercises in order to start with machine learning	4

it gave a nice challenging and very engaging introduction to different data preparation techniques the course surveyed twitter data stream analysis sql mapreduce jobs and a host of nosql and graph tools while it could use assignments for the latter topics the course was structured in an easy to follow manner and was sufficiently challenging to keep engagement in addition the way the lessons were broken down into digestable chunks greatly aided in keeping engagement and keeping my interest i look forward to future courses offered by uwashington and the same professor	4
very useful course provide a basic view of project management	4
overall a comprehensive introduction to iot systems for everybody	4

very useful training very well done organized and very inspiring i enjoyed every lesson	4
this course provided me with some vital knowledge about health and nutrition however i consider it to be very short and rather shallow the issues would require more coverage than with some weeks  minutes for the whole week another issue is the tests   margin for passing the exam seems too easy the videos have great graphics and the issues are well explained overaly  stars	2

this was my first course on coursera and i very much enjoyed it it is very well structured andrew explained each topic in a very intuitive way and i feel like i have a very good idea now of what machine learning actually is and how i can apply it to real world problems however the coding exercises tend to be a little bit too demanding at least at the beginning if you only have little experience with octaves programming language and if you are not trained in econometricsstatistics more optional coding examples might be helpful at the beginning nevertheless this is a great course and i would recommend it to anybody interessted in machine learning thank you andrew	4
good course learnt a lot thank you 	3
course is very intense good knowledge of scalajava indeed needed for solving the assignments but the topics were cool functional programming combined with oop principles and a hybrid of those turned to pattern matching every class can be compressed every object is a function absolutely top drawer of programming	4
great course it was difficult but mostly due to my lack of basic knowledge about statistics a primer lesson would have been great but with some research on some topics on my own i could complete the course with a sufficient understanding of the conceptsi found the lectures and assignments to be very clear and concise props for the professor 	3
the first  weeks have too many videos which make it difficult to follow this breaks the flow of the lectures and makes a lot of unuseful repetitionsthe slides only have words and are hard to follow no graphs or illustrations this means that you rely on the voice of the lecturer to guide you which is difficult sometimesfurthermore the code presented is not run live and results are often lacking which makes comparison with my own results hard to dosummary not that its a bad course swirl is a great tool just look for another course thats easier to follow	1
great course	4

it is a really good and well structured course initially i felt the structure is not making me think but when i reached the end in summative project i realized how much i have learned anyone with basic it background would be comfortable with the course learned various concepts of business intelligence and microstrategy as a bi tool is good for analyzing after i am done i am going to spend more time looking at other tools of microstrategy and apply those in the capstone course if required i came across some students facing issues with microstrategy in the discussion forum but i think improper installation or hardware and software support could be the causethank you mr karimi	4
very good course thank youi wish we could have use case applications with high level tools such as rthanks a lot again 	3
amazing course highly recommended	4

this course was very average to me compared to the first course in the specialization fundamentals of quantitative modeling which was absolutely greatwhat i likedgood info on the tools in excel that are neededwhat i didnt liketime spent on content that necessarily wasnt regarding models the critical material was buried in videos and was very brief more time should have been spent additionally the quiz questions were subjective at times based on what was said on video and the formula answers werent correctly graded in many casesthis course could have been much better maybe i was just spoiled by the first course	2
much of the course seemed to cover what was previously discussed about the only thing this course did for me was to introduce me to in design the teacher was ok but she seemed to lack enthusiasm particularly when she was demonstrating the bookbinding	3
overall good classinstructor is lively and engaging	3
so educating and fascinating it has really expanded my intellectual horizons and research venn diagram into more circles	4
i really enjoy this course and i have learned so much thank you to everyone for this opportunity specially to professor r wright for making this course so easy to follow thank you	4
awesome course an incredible opportunity to polish writting skill and to meet some fellow writters	4
great course it just has some small problems regarding scripts considering that most of them give some warning messages due to the latest version of unity which made some changes and deprecated some stuffive also felt sorry discovering that i can submit the tests and the projects only if i purchase the certificate	3
can be a little bit to hard for beginners but great and interesting assignments	3
an enjoyable introduction to the use of python and text file handling	4
very well planned enjoyed doing this course	4
there were some real technical problems in this course the video sound wouldnt match up in places and the brief questions inserted into the video would come prior to us learning the content to answer the question in addition the quiz answers would not match up to what was learned in the video for example one quiz asked what type of question would tell me about a time be and in the video it literally said it was a behavioral question but that was marked wrong in the quiz there were also several instances where the percentages taught to us were marked wrong in the quiz this was not as high of a quality learning experience as the first course in the specialization so i was quite disappointed i do hope someone will go through this course and fix the inconsistencies and technical errors thank you	1
very informative and easy to understand	4
really good class	4
this is an amazing classlife changing experience its help me a lot to deal with my children god only knows children are always testing you	4
great curse adds the missing part of contemporary education	4
very useful	4
very basic but important knowledge	3
i learned a lot thank you for that 	4
despite the fact that this course isnt really difficult at all it gives you the opportunity to introduce yourself in the area of microprocessors i would recommend it to anyone interested in the area of iot and embedded systems you should really understand the concepts of this course before diving into the world of iot	3
this was a great introduction course i have been researching social media for quite some time and most of the information learned was new to me	4
course content is amazing it covers all basic rules for professional emails all videos are self explanatory	4
barely any contents in the course only a few minutes of lectures no quizzes and poorly constructed assignments that waste a lot of time weeks  and  have the worst material ive seen in all the courses ive taken until today	0
very hard to follow unless you have had a good deal of experience with programming i would not really recommend like the teachers ok but they all went through too much material way too fast and without proper explanation i will take other classes on programming and then come back to this one again later maybe	1
great info and easy to understand	4
the content seems to be excellent regarding what is presented but sadly the sound quality is rather bad sounds like an ageold valve radio with a lot of dropouts and professor daphne is an agile and therefore less disciplined speaker which lessens the understandability of her speech in conjunction with the poor sound quality furthermore especially for me as a nonnative foreign english speaker it is very hard to follow and now i am at one point in the course that is flow of probalistic influence where she explains a concept without explaining what is meant with the used underlying notions flow and influence which makes me difficult to understand what is going on that means in my point of view that the slides are not sufficiently prepared although im very interested in the topic i am asking myself after the first view videos if i should continue or drop because my cognitive capacitity is for me to worthful to use it for the decoding of badly prepared and presented material ok my decision heuristic in such cases is use the hammer not the tweezers therefore i have dropped please improve the state of this class from beta to release then i will come back	1
this course was great i have worked with statistics for a while but always grappled with some concepts having completed this course i feel much more confident in interpreting findings and designing studies this is especially the case for bayesian statistics and likelihoods that were not even part of the curriculum when i went to university	4
an excellent introduction to copyright law for those in education	4
love it very high quality	4
i enjoyed every minute of it because it satisfied my curiosity about learning more about whats out there	4
there was little of actual teaching going on in this course the pace was too rushed for beginners and peerreviewing was managed so poorly it was unhelpful	0
one of the best teacher ive ever have i enjoy every minute of the video love the assistant teacher i wish to be able to shake his hand some day	4
