it is the perfect way to learn all of that information the course is awesome and the teacher is very very nice	4
useful information to help me learn	4
awesome teacher	4
very great and exciting course with videos  i learned a lot about transportation modes warehousing and building a logistics network in usa	4
this class was super useful i had a minimal amount of base python under my belt and some data analysis in r but this course really got me off the ground using the pandas data analysis library for python and jupyter notebooks	4
great introduction	4
an interesting and inspirational course on an important topic  how to build sound and resonant relationships with the people around you	4
this is so interesting even though i knew some of the concepts i think the lecturers were able to organize an amazing course and i could learn some new concepts	4
very much low details and the course instructor has very slow pace when he is teaching on the board that aaaaaaaa is very irritating	1
i rated this class  because the instruction content resources and pacing are all excellent and this course is true to its description highly recommended for anyone who has taken python for everybody getting started in python these two courses are a best match for someone learning their first programming language learning with professor severance is fun in bitesized pieces and with just enough challenge to keep you engaged and moving forward without getting discouraged professor severance has mastered teaching programming at scale thank you	4
the course allows you to gain some interesting experience in text mining if youre into this thing you can do really nice coursework	4
i like this course because of its content it is an awesome experience a must do course	4
like this one as well as the others in the series	4
excellent course specially the dbi part	4
good material id prefer the course going without graphlab though i hope course  will be produced one day	4
perfect course	4
great introduction to using tableau if youre like me and never used it jana gives an excellent lecture never boring or monotoned	4
basic knowledge about photograph but it is so useful and great for me an armature guide thanks teachers so much	4
the professor does not pronounce the words correctly his english grammar is bad the terms used are too difficult to understand and way of teaching is too complicated the ppts are full of errors and too direct there is no continuity i hardly learnt anything from this video	1
great intro to python	4
so far its been just about  week since i have started the course but im really excited i like the tasks the course is built in a way that really motivates you to create after all its a core goal for the graphic designer keep it up lets see what happens next good luck to every one	4
thank you this course advanced my skills in korean i appreciate your efforts and those of your students i am better not than when i started 대단히 감사합니다	4
a great foundation	4
learn about user research and ideas generation	4
it is not five stars for just one reason it think it could be better if having not so long video please professor amar split the minutesminutes videos in small portionsnotwithstanding it was amazing and inspiring to know how democratic the american constitution creation process was unfortunately because the socialism and communism influence in our country we do not have much information about everything which have to do with american history and cultureyou american people would be proud their history and take care to things go on at the same way	3
very slow pacing but ok content	2
fantastic course although i am registered blind and have hearing impairment i am able to pick up a lot o useful information and i have to say i am making slow but steady steps	4
this course was a great introduction it laid the ground work for the specialization in an easy to follow manner it was also packed with lots of great information in a short time	3
very helpful course for beginners and congratulations for putting up such a great work togetherbut a few suggestions  most importantly the assignments were very very hard for starters in functional programming and scala it would be much more enjoyable to many more if its made a little easier the content was great but i believe a little more both in breadth and depth was needed to be covered moreover the categorization can be rethought and a little reorganizednevertheless a great course will surely recommend this one	3
i love all those courses i have learned so much and im planning to complete all  units	4
good material but even better external material shown by links to blogs or related stufftoo focused in scrum maybe other methodologies are worth to explainill not buy it since im a sm but if you are beginning with this topics or want to pursue a sm certificate this course definitively can help you	3
great course	4
charles is a great teacher had never ever done coding ever before but through this course a new interest has taken shape and i am sure this would be helpful for my professional progress	4
this course is excellent for those who want a theoretical introduction to machine learning and has some background with calculus andrew ng makes everything looks really easy the exercises are good because you can actually see things running and they are not really difficult tutorials make them easy also i wish the assignments were in python although matlaboctave is a programming language that you cant really deploy as an application but they let you focus in the algorithms in instead of data structures i now have a great idea about plenty of algorithms know how to use them know how to optimize them and can understand many materials online thanks andrew tom and other people responsible for making it all available	4
this course was very useful for me in terms of remebering the busines and entrepreneuship concepts this course is designed in easy and simple way to get knowledge on specific vocabulary teachers speak not fast and it is great for those who just starts to learn english for work or passing language exams course also have very bright clear images definitions and moreover it includes grammar classes i can definitely advise this course that is led by teachers from penn unniversity	4
very interesting and useful class not only teach the theory but also give actionable advices of enhancing learning ability	4
great course for someone who has never had a philosophy course	4
i am very satisfied with this course	4
great course	4
i have just begun this course completed week  and i have to say i am impressed with the course and how well it is put together i am a grad student in the states and have been through many classes that were not nearly this informative up to date and intriguing right out of the gate impressive	3
great way to start developing fast and in a responsive way 	4
good introduction to social media	4
thanks for all 	4
an excellent overview of dinosaurs and birds the closest some of us will ever get to a paleontology class outside of enrolling in a university	4
clear explanation of global history	4
the layout of the course organization the structure and the additional key points displayed next to the lecturer make it easy to understand and follow overall the course has kept me interested and eager to apply to the universities summer program	4
a very dense and instructive lesson a bit sad that it is already over	4
i found this course really amazing dr shane must be a very brilliant teacher	4
great class the professor has a rather interesting sense of humor which actually makes the whole experience more enjoyable the assignments are challenging enough to make sure you learn but are still doable within the allotted time one recommendation from me is to use the same tools he uses in the videos such as brackets as it becomes a bonus to get familiar with new development tools	4
course assignments have nothing to do with the lectures most of the assignments could have been copypasted stuff from the previous course in this specialization same as with previous course  review point organization leaves too many space for individual opinions assignment with a video clip is something i didnt expect at all i had to download a bunch of free software to make it and i didnt make it good enough because im not skilled in using those programs of course it then reflected my average score because review point system is too much oriented toward personal opinions of others i felt this course gave me the least out of this specialization and i also felt this course scratched a lot of things but didnt quite get into many details that could have been mentioned maybe even instead of the assignments that were quite dull to me there is a section of clips that is a bit useless to those outside of usa unlike previous course this one was at least doable inside the expected work hours  week except for the video assignment which took me a bit more and thats why ill give it  point higher than previous coursethis review might sound a bit harsh even though its not the intention with a bit of polishing it could become really great but it really could use some of the improvements i have mentioned above	3
excellent teachers excellent assignments my favorite mooc so far congrats	4
i loved this class colleen did a great job in explaining teasing and enticing us to learn more about css i had no idea that all this power was available to me thanks colleen	4
never enjoied that much calculus	4
this is a good course but theres some flaws not about knowledge	3
top course from johns hopkins university as alwaysangular js can sometimes be tricky to understandbut the way they presented it made things very easy to understandthe most thing which i like about the course is that it not only teaches the angular js but also gives an idea of how the things work at backend thus making the concepts more clear and doubt freelast but certainly not the least thanks johns hopkins university for presenting such a knowledge full course it certainly made took my web designing skills to a whole new level	4
best course i had ever taken in coursera	4
very practical course love it	4
great course very digestible and with enough information	4
too basic	1
i like this course the syllabus coverage is good i am eagerly waiting to enroll the next course	4
this course is superbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb	4
very good online learning experience	3
i think the course content is global history us in center	3
the historical lectures were marvelous the literature lectures only a little less so but the most enjoyable was both extremely knowledgable professorsif you want to truly understand the myriad background the nazi psychology and insanity the witness of those who suffered the most and the indepth story of the holocaust this is an outstanding academic experience	4
this whole specialization is an outstanding program the instructors are entertaining and they strike the right balance between theory and practice even though i consider myself quite literate in statistics and numerical optimization i learned several new techniques that i was able to directly apply in various part of my job ok not in the foundations course but in subsequent courses we really go in depth while other classes ive taken limit themselves to an inventory of available techniques in this specialization i get to implement key techniques from scratch highly highly recommendedfyi the python level required is really minimal and the total time commitment is around  hours per week	4
very good introduction the text is confusing at times but thats just part of learning new language	4
useful good insights the idea of analyzing the history of strategy	4
great course to give you an overview of financial markets	4
very clear course well structured a lot of valuable information for the beginners	4

great course gives you a great perspective of how to start scheduling and estimate your budget for new projectsi love this course and how it is presented	4
very good course the final assignment was stretching and i enjoyed this challenge	4
great course for anyone striving to improve their communication and writing skills in academic environment highly recommended	4
this is really nice helps a lot if you know nothing about css	3
amazing course please offer more courses like this on fraud examination and forensic accounting i would also be interested to take a course on internal audit internal controls and res management	4
this course failed greatly to balance the workload by week the third week which i think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier another proof of week  issue the related swirl exercises start in week  of them and finish in week  more exercises i think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learnerstudent to do more searchexercises on the subject	1
this course has been a great opportunity to improve my learning skill i appriciate the given opportunity and look forward for ne cources from this team thanks a lot	4
many tips in this course are very good and important i missed some of them before and this course help me pay attention to them and learn them clearly i highly recommended to you and i wont take you much time	4
good resources in order to improve your own academic writing	4
very nice course highly recommended	4
this course offers an insight to most of the machine learning techniques currently deployed however it does not go in depth for any of it amazing programming exercises very well structured very helpful and easily understandable they make sure that you only implement what is relevant to the course and all else clutter reading typechecking etc is already in place for you the instructor is easily understandable and the presentations are very well structured coming from an engineeringcomputing background would hope for more math and insights but this is a course that can be taken by economics or other majors really enjoyed it and has prepared me to delve deeper into machine learning and craft ml systems as part of my school or in my free time	4
very interesting and good to follow	4
no use for me no music examples because copyrights did not allow so the course is pretty boringsorry not for me	0
this course is done	4
good course for learning about how our bran works but the curriculum is slowpaced	3
its very useful for a rookie to star learning ml	4
although this project is very openended with little guidance it definitely requires the fullstack of data science to complete	3
the teaching content is excellent the instructors explanation is clear and intuitiveit would be more helpful if the instructor can address the forums at times rather than leaving it entirely to the tas	3
i like it as economics student	4
o	4
great course loved it	3
a great introduction to the science of communication very interesting and properly articulated	4
i learned a lot from this class this is not only a class that give you a right way to learning handle your procrastination the secret of memory but also show you the scientific evidence if a scientist tell me that the procrastination is not a big deal i will believe that more than just somebody tell me also this class gave me the passion and confidence to learn something new	4
excellent contents but relators english is pretty bad 	3
the teaching was awesome i had already taken course in mobile computing during my under graduate study i suggest you develop a course with in depth concepts covering more technical details	3
it was a very good course	4
simply fantastic a great easytounderstand tool to master hardtolearn subjects	4
definitely a great addon cert for those with healthcare professional backgrounds biomedic graduates prospective public health grad students or those wishing to pursue a career in the pharmaceutical industry	4
a very useful course everybody should work it as learning gets easy after	4
the lectures are very wellorganized the topics are also cover in this field however the lectures are very dry and boring the main professor were reading the scripts on the monitor from my perspective with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail i would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space like coffee shop to make this course more attractive im sorry it is not what i expected	0
this was so much more interesting than i expected it to be	4
very good online class if you are taking ap macroeconomics in high school gives a good overview and serves as a great study guide	4
great course for beginner in data science	4
this course is amazing more than i expected you can relate it with everything no matter your career its effective	4
fantastic discussion and live examples of pieces this course gave me a wonderful overview and context for understanding the development of the string quartet what i found most fascinating was the pure objectivity in the lectures and the plethora of styles i was introduced to that previously i had not known webern smetana and shostakovitch both mr steinhardt and ms chung are excellent scholars i highly recommend this course as it gives you a lifetime of specific quartets to get to know	4
somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coding that i could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it i had to cheat i dont feel like i am learning anymore	0
big thx for you work very interesting and useful	4
i like the explanations and worked exercises i also love the fact i can speed up the videos because sometimes its too slow for my taste	4
not really about product management but about project management	1
good information would have preferred more indepth lectures and detailed information more lecturer interactionengagement on the issuesoverall i enjoyed the course and it was great	3
very very good course to learn in effective and efficient manner	4
thanks for this course it helps me to learn graphic design as well	4

fantastic teaching  really fun to learn python with prof severance	4
each specialization has been better than the previous one and i have learned so much the sad part for me is that with everything i learn i understand how much more i need to learn but having said that this course and the professors are wonderful and their excitement about photography is conveyed in every class	4
i love it this is a course every person has to take  it teaches skills necessary to anyone who values personal development and learning or simply wants to become a better person	4
during the lectures not all the slides were well revised and the peer assessments should include more specific guides	3

i really liked this course concepts well explained i was hoping for more practical exercises on different types of data sets along with how to improve model accuracy in various algorithm taught concept such as pruning etc were missing but i am sure in future we will have more on it thanks professor	4
i would say it was very quick overviewed and extremely informative course however i would recommend not to stop on this and look up for more on html css and js	3
excellent course very complete and gives a great overview of the asset manag	4
extremely informative and fun perhaps update some material with the latest findings eg results from the dawn mission to ceres as well as more details on the elusive planet thank you nonetheless prof brown for sharing your contagious enthusiasm for the science of solar system with us	3
thank you to all the members of course on this great effort has been spectacular and of course benefited him a lot and was very entertaining explanation you are great	4
very interesting and useful course everything is very clearly explained apart from theory it is very interesting the octavematlab exercises	4
really enjoy the energy of the professor more practice questions would take this to the next level	3
this course is just awesome thanks prof ng for thatalthough the course has very less and easy programming assignments but still the theory covered is pretty vast and well contained	3
professor is engaging concise and his points and presentations keep my attention truly appreciate the challenge of not seeing faces but being engaging via a screen really well done	4
a great introduction to python dr severance did a wonderful job explaining all of the topics in a way that was easy to understand and learn the exercises were the perfect level of difficulty  a little bit challenging but completely possible given the things we learned in video lectures	4
i wish i had known the ideas in this course a decade ago a brilliant course that offers the student the opportunity to learn real practical sciencebased techniques to understand their mind and improve their learning a thousand thanks to both professors for creating learning how to learn	4
good introduction but could go more in depth	3
awesome course on how the mind learns very useful tips for avoiding procrastination as well	4
there was some interesting information in here and i found a few things useful that said you have to sift through a lot of gimmicks to get to the parts of the lessons that actually matter	1
the course presents lots of concepts and papers but it doesnt really seems applicable in realityit felt too fluffy and subjective to me	0
this course was so interesting and good planned so i couldnt do anything else in my spare time other than watching this course and answering simple questions except just one week this course is build very well it is also a short one but gives a good perspective to various topics in management social and organizational psychology i totally recommend taking it for all not only managers but all who wants to improve their daytoday communications goal setting and mentoring	4
amusing and interesting course	4
i really loved the course and found it to be incredibly useful and well taughtit was so well explained that i would like to have even more info about food and healthplease continue to have courses like thisthanks	4

i thoroughly enjoyed this course it was presented with great knowledge and passion and despite being full of musical terminology and detail it was always accessible to me as a nonplayer i learned so much about how this wonderful music was structured and composed	4
very well structured clear explanations and great additional resources to test and repeat the material thank you very much	4
i loved the set up of the course that professor frederikson included other professors and professionals in her class it made the class lively and presented different point of views or different examples the homework exercises were very interesting and thought provoking i would recommend this class to anyone and in particular to people who do not believe that having a positive attitude  outlook in life will  can make a difference in so many different ways i am looking forward to an additional course on positive psychology in the future	4
course is a little formulaic had trouble making my submissions follow the structure outlined but still i learnt some useful tips and actually got to just write something orderlyliked some of the visiting speakers the third speaker who talked about character  mature lady dark hair was quite good so was the first gentlemanoverall the course is ok but given the strict methodology and requirements for writing i dont know if ill make it through the specialisationthank you for reading	0
i can see a couple of problems in this course how to access and change elements in a data frame especially the use of loc and iloc is not explained very well and i believe there is an error in the slides the second thing is that i have found more powerful methods in pandas documentation for example assign or nlargest and nsmallest this is not really a problem if one of the hidden purposes is to push students to actively search the docs for what they would like to dowork load for the assignments is just fine in my opinion not too little not too muchoverall i am satisfied	3
i have learned much more about photography in the short few weeks of this course than studying much longer on my own great course	3
super awesome i wish i had taken this earlier in my job search it makes a lot of the algorithms you find in tech interviews super intuitive	4
excellent content indepth compared to may other moocs the instructors have organized the lectures very well and shown some useful and practical methods that can be implemented at various stages	3
excellent for beginners many a thanks to dr chuck boy he really makes it easier to learn quiz and assignment reiterates the slides taking out revision pain personally i liked the extra videos and dr chuck singing i got my mojo ya	4
needs more data visiualizations images that used repeated many times which is confusinng	3
educational fun and creative i highly recommend it	4
in his normal fashion dr charles covers the material at the correct level he doesnt bog you down in the details but gives you what you need	4
coding documents and data cleaning is possibly the best thing ever d	4
this course is a brilliant introduction to game design if youve got little or no experience in the area or with unity d this is absolutely the place to start congratulations to professor brian winn and staff for the excellent work	4
the best course to start	4
this class is amazing thats because we can learn machine learning algorithms and implement them at the same time this class provides good structure of the machine learning programs so you can understand better machine learning algorithms and programming skills for beginners i strongly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in machine learning	4
quite interesting especially the way the studies were made and how they were evaluated it would be nice that after such long time now to include the results of the schools studyi was also expecting more details on the nnd itself  food preparation detailed food recipes	3
very good course though a bit less challenging than i have expected a true capping of the previous courses	3
humorous teacher concise and useful explanation	4
dr chuck is the most outstanding professor i have ever seen he is very kind and patient the course contains the basic algorithm and data structures in python although it will sounds very difficult to get involved in i feel very comfortable to watch the lecture and finish the quiz and assignments this course is very helpful for me to develop the big picture of programming i look forward to finish the series of python course instructed by dr chuck i really appreciate his guidance	4
awesome course learned so much	4
should have been a complete course the course did not give specific tools to conflict resolution rather information about the subject was disseminated	2
i enjoyed a lot with the course very nice study	4
good course i like it and the way it was given	3
very useful thanks to the dynamic professor jerry 	4
the professor has clearly taken time to make the information as clear and concise as possible which is highly appreciated i think anyone who has an interest in understanding how new digital tools are shaping marketing decisions would highly benefit from this course as the information is as clear as it is crucial im looking forward to the next class 	4
just awesome have a wonderful learning experience	4
cool coursevery useful info	4
dear professori love the way you taught me since last month your way of teaching using real life examples helped me to better understand and solve the problems thank you for sharing your lecture in coursera and making it available so that a distant student like me can take advantage and thank you one more time professorsudesh pathak	4
i really enjoyed the course the instructors are fantastic and i also liked the way they use videos and online interactions to deliver the content	4
perfect	4
very interesting open new point of view for more exploring	3
great teaching from andrew ng never thought i could learn so much online 	4
good course on the various ps legal needs technology needs and what it means to be inc lacked details on how you go about running a business  so lets say i wanted to start a business analysis consulting firm besides getting a business number what else do i need to hire people earn revenue and run the business profitably	2
very good course	4
first  weeks are manageable and the final project is great i had a lot of fun 	3
high level overview of data and analytics in business	4
like the way instructor kept it simple yet informative deliberately avoids unnecessary terminology quizzes and assignments help in understanding the ideas put forth in lectures would have been even better if we had a final project longertougher than assignments	3
very helpful course	4
the best	4
it is best pathway to learn about how to deal with different projects every manager must do this for better result	4
an excellent r course for the beginners	4
good course for tableau and effective communication	3
great course the instructor is able to simplify complicated stuff grasp focus on teaching core concepts of latest html css and javascript functions through using real exampleapplication this helps me as student to quickly understand the technologies and apply them without spending too much time or losing focus in every details the exercise and assignment is very helpful to measure what we learned and how to apply them	4
i took the first two classes last year when i was trying out coursera now that i really want to pursue a python certificate im going for all the classes this timei highly recommend this class if youre new to python	4
very useful	4
i really enjoyed learning from this course it was diverse and exciting the assignments were interesting and makes the student feel as though you are truly an osteoarchaeologist who needs to solve the mystery of the skeleton the only downside of this course is the peerreviewed assignment the peer review is done by multiplechoice from  to  for five aspects of your submission and many peers do not leave any comment to provide feedback for improvement so if you didnt pass the assignment the first time you might not have a clue what it is that you should improve for the second submission apart from the fact that you are reviewed by peers  not specialists who might be wrong themselves it is very annoying that you are not able to learn from your mistakes perhaps this course could improve on this point by making it obligatory for peers to add a comment	3
very informative	4
good balance explaining modern psychology and buddhism as well as how the former has aided to support empirically most of the observations laid out by the latter centuries ago lectures are very insightful and carefully crafted turning the whole six week course into a delightful experience to those interested not only in buddhism but also in modern psychology and behavioural theory	4
absolutely fantastic lectures	4
it covered the basics of a very interesting platform	4
perfect for the very beginners in programming	4
very well structured and highly interesting 	4
very informative loved the course keep making more please	4
perfect class about machine learning i learned a lot and get a clear whole picture about machine learning also im very appreciated the well designed hands on practices to try and solve for interesting problems thanks	4
 not perfect but very clear and consistent im only in week  and this is my first coursera course there are some topics that i feel need a little more clarification but that is my only complaint perhaps it would be a good idea for the site to have a faq for each individual course the professor or course instructor could answer these questions for future course sessions perhaps theres a reason this idea wouldnt work but it would be nice to see from the students perspective	3
a nice ending project but other user reviewing can be unreliable the diagrams were still helpful and made the videos more comprehensive	4
great course highly recommended	4
very informative lectures from dr chuck i would recommend this course to anyone that wants solid guidance from ab on the road to python development	4
cool	4
martin is an excellent teacher thanks for sharing your knowledge with us	4
very easy to understand and know how to succeed in the future on the learning path thanks a lot 	4
practical way of explanations really helped	4
very good lectures and even fun the tool is extremely usefulmore feedback and assistance would generally improve the quality	3
this course is so amazing	4
i would like to have more example it feels there is mostly theory the quizzes were super easy i dropped out at final project i couldnt get through the first questions the course and especially the final project requires a good basis in statistics beforehandthe assistants are super helpful and patient	2
this was a great reintroduction to algorithms for a cs graduate great content fastpaced and the forums were very helpful	4
excellent course the material and the vídeos are great and the subjects are very well explained	4
this course is great if you are looking for learning responsive web designing using twitter bootstrap lot of areas are covered in this single course along	4
absolutely brilliant crucial course for everyone interested in learning i think this should be the first course for everyone who start using coursera	4
there arent enough examples to get us a good path to learning python more practice and solved questions were required	2
terrific instructor easy to follow and well paced covers a lot of area but the exercises are very much hand holding where your part is just plugging in a few lines of code ive been doing modeling work for many years and this machine learning course has given me additional tools that i feel will definitely be helpful for solving future problems	3
excellent course to get learn how to interpret studies and select the appropriate tests for your own research	4
its good as an introductory course	3
as usual the team does a great job of distilling complex ideas without sacrificing the quality of information data science is a complicated field dont be fooled by the topics the walk before you run approach is super productive for your learning curve if youre not native to this field	4
this course gives you strong foundation for machine learning though this course is old its recommended this is quite hard when compared to other courses thanks to andrew ng	4
i find it an excellent course truly when of the best ive joined on coursera	4
superb course especially for beginners	4
capstone was very well put together and by far the highlight of the course amazing job by the course developers to create such an interactive finale to the course that brought together all the concepts into a real world simulation	4
really good lecture  support it 	4
excellent entry point for those who want to learn python from scratch	4
excellent i cant say enough good things about the professor she does an amazing job explaining the more complex ideas and concepts in a way that is clear and very easy to understand great course so far	4
really good coursetotally recoemended	4
this course introduced me to new valuable concepts that i find useful in my daily work i liked tha clarity of most of the teachers the case studies served to understand better the concepts presented however i would have liked to learn more about the situation regarding water resource management in south america	3
very helpful clear and easy	4
this course has improved my learning skills immensely	4
this class was wonderful as a visual learner i learn better with images involved thank you prof	4
broken down very simple and not a fast pace great for beginners	4
very good series for learning java and oo principles the big application approach is very interesting as we can see the whole picture even when we know little yet the interviews with software engineers are very enlightening	4
i understand that many people want to quickly jumping on the topic but there should be a minimum set of prerequisites before starting this class this would avoid digressions such as explaining basic vectormatrix operations or unnecessary calculus reviews	2
for a successfull career turn to this course	4
nicelearned a lot	4
a really good course but not worth being part of a specialization should be very helpful for students  freshers who are preparing for an engineering interview personally i felt most people would have taken up this course paying the course fee only because it was a mandatory part of this specialization	4
i learned so much in this course the professor is really good and explains the concepts with practical examples i really enjoyed this course and i am motivated to keep moving forward	4
i like the professor so much he is so cute lol	4
this course is well defined and great material to cover the fundamentals of gcp available services and the subject matter on bigdata and machine learning the labs are great as well really enjoyed this course	4
the best course of paleontology and paelobiolgy thanks	4
very good conclusion to learning the fundamentals of python after the first class ive already been programming in python for awhile but there was some basics i had missed which was extremely helpful for me to learn about im very excited for the next classes	4
sometimes boring and i felt like the quizzes were just worded in a tricky way rather than really assessing learning otherwise fine	3
really an awesome course	4
its my first course in coursera aerial robotics is a great course for me to learn more about quadrotor control some tools in matlab are very useful to help me deeply understand the material of the course unfortunately formula or model of control have not explained yet i hope formula of model of the control can be explained even it need external source or refer to some books 	3
this is the third course i made on this journey to becoming a journalist at the michigan state university and im very satisfied professors are prepared explaining clearly every aspects for being a serious and honest journalist i recomend it to everyone who want to be a journalist but also for people whoi want to know who means to be a journalist thank you to all professors im waiting for the next step	4
very interactive and it was fun completing the course learned a lot	4
this is a good course for brushing up or learning the basics of quantitative modeling	4
highly recomendable to teachers who want to refrehen their knowledge	4
a very great course for all it person	4
the course consider wide area of themes of software security but not deep generally its really good course	4
outstanding teachers excellent explanations with reallife examples making complex topics understandable quite easily congratulations	4
an excellent course for those new or seasoned to marketing we live in a digital world and if you own your own business work for a large company or are a freelancer like me you can grow your business and benefit from this class seriously do yourself a favor and take this class	4
everything has been explained in a systematic way	4
really great introduction to game design in unity would be nice to include a more detailed intro to c as well but i expect this to come in the follow up course i would choose this over other online beginners courses	4
the material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging but the course is not well prepared the assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials eg downloadable slideshandouts available to assist in learning	1
too simple	1
the course was excellent with very good structure with the right level of difficultycomplexity with very good slides  discussions the only couple of points for potential amendments that i would propose is a avert from callingmentioning drugs with their brand names but rather use the active ingredient names only and b perhaps providing resources for further reading ie web links etc to all material after each lecture like you did for week  final lecture	4
good planning methodologies and examples	4
easy to understand	2
this course is great well organised and clearly argued i followed each and every section of it and all the readings and recourses are well prepared would recommend to anyone who is doing research in law technology and sociology alike	4
very complete some things like the chunks and forming chunks is confuse despite the good example and mental images i think was very useful for learn all the topics that a want to learn of different areas	4
this course is very difficult for beginners	1
this course is excellent and covers many topics i recommend itwe are never lost during the videos because the motivations are well explainedfurthermore andrew ng speaks very clearly and is easily understood by a non native english speaker like mei liked particularly the practical advices with the common mistakes that we should avoidi dont give  stars just because it lacks a followup in order to go deeply to the subject with a kind of final project and a certificate given in case of successmaybe i should also have a look at the corresponding stanford course which is supposed to be more complete than the online one	3
the course is excellent for me to remind me with everything in html css and jsbut i guess its not for newbies to these subjectsthere is so many points that i guess need to have prior knowledge	4
i have enjoyed this course it presented the onehealth concept very clearly and what its aims are which were particularly interesting especially for me who is interested in antimicrobial resistance research however some improvements could be made the presenters with accents  nonenglish speakers were a bit difficult to follow and the transcripts were somewhat inaccurate so it would be go to have proper transcription in that regard thank you	3
good course on the whole learned a lot and enjoyed it but it would need to be updated and corrected certain bits of code dont work as they did when the course was produced which can be pretty confusing would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course  the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity keep it up  cheers	3
nice course to start your machine learning career	4
it provided me with the profound understanding of the issue thank you very much	4
excellent course informative good use of visuals work is at an easy pace for those with less time	4
informative organized and targeted for learning dr pienta and the other hopkins professionals involved in putting this course together did an excellent job and were engaging throughout i hope more material like this from johns hopkins becomes available in the notsodistant future	4
very very good im already recommending the specialisation to people	4
i think its very nicely organized however most of the information is common sense to me but i really enjoyed the cooking demonstrations and gardening tip definitely thinking about starting a basil plant	3
loved this course it was very thorough however i think assignments could have been made more clearer as it was often hard to figure out what needed to be done without checking discussion forums	4
some assignments could have been better explained	3
i love the way this professor talk about events i learned so much	4
definitely a mustsee	4
good pacing learned some new things about how the brain works in regard to learning as well as picking up some new techniques highly recommended course	4
got to learn cool new concept and tags 	3
very basic i guess if you have no education or experience its good	0
thank you for you work	4
ive been a supporter of environmental sustainability efforts for a long time however i lacked trainingknowledge as my undergraduate studies are in business passion is great but in the real world you need skills to back up that passion i am proud to say that can now engage in active conversations with people who are working in sustainability related fields this is a very empowering course	4
very good course	4
very detailed and a nicely structured program lectures were surprisingly precise	4
i highly recommend this course with a lot of advises from real life very clear communication style and with a real good sense of humor there is no time for being boredexcellent 	4
help me a lot in learning make me understand why my hard work doesnt paid off	4
great instructor good examples and aspects	4
love all the teachers and the course	4
excellent to better understand those new threats	4
its my honor to complete this course and its followings thank youprofessor severance for your detailed explanation and hilarious touch and above all thank you coursera for providing such a great chance for all the students around the world including me a college student from chinawhich the access to the top courses of top universities	4
peer reviews was unfair its must be any methods to exclude inadequate learners from reviewing blacklists is only one way to stop them now	2
prof sachs takes us through a very interesting and engaging course on the need for sustainable development it is simple in most parts while i enjoyed the number crunching questions in the quiz i can imagine that it is not for everyone it is extremely informative and i have filled up a notebook with my notes from all of the  lecturesjust taking a star away for some of the links or course material not being updated for instance the links to external websites are not valid any more also the actual sdgs are different from the ones in the lecture as the ones in the lecture were proposed as against the current actual ones	3
id like to say thanks to all that helped make this mooc  it feels good to hear change is possible for anyone at any time	4
well thought out learnt some new approaches to common tasks	4
it is of great value for first learners of machine learning one can get a comprehensive impression on the common used machine learning methods and technologies besides through learning this course it can inspire a students enthusiasm for other fundamental courses like probability theory linear algebra and the combinational optimization etc well this is really a great course	4
at first the presentations are really on a semi professional level copy  paste codes making errors without knowing the cause they show a lot what can be done with swift but the never showmention what its really usefull for no real life usage just snippets after snippetsto few practical doings mostly only quiz stuff	0
it is a good course through which one can easily understand python data structure	4
great course great teacher congratulations and thanks for sharing your knowledge	4
great course to get into machine learning the explanations are clear the pace is not high and the programming exercises are well constructed and helpful the lecturer in some cases makes reference to somewhat more advanced concepts that may not be central in these course but that can be useful for some of the audience perhaps id like that the lecturer make the audience aware of the connections of machine learning with other disciplines and on the fact that machine learning borrows many concepts and methods from other areas eg statistics and optimization all in all it is a course that i will recommend to anyone that wants to get introduced to machine learning and in general to know a number of techniques to actually address and solve reallife problems	4
currently i am taking this course so far it has been very good all the assignments i try to do it on my own with out referring to much of the hints it gives  clarity on various algorithms once completing the assignments over all very very good course for beginners for who look for mathematical rigour this is not the course as it is more of implementing the end expressions using octaves more useful for it engineers who work in companies than researchers	4
nice course to get started	4
it was an interesting module however not sure how i will apply this in	2
andrew ng is really cool 	4
this was best course till i took machine learning from university of washington	3
too easy	3
very smooth and fluid introduction to the basics of the gis field and arcgis software feel like i developed good working knowledge in a very short time excited to go into more depth in future courses	4
enjoyed this course and the presenter was lively making for good participation	4
very basic everything in here can be found online on a blog youtube video or a book dont waste your money	0
the first two weeks the course present a reasonable pace for beginners the second two weeks when the java script is introduced the projects suddenly become very hard it is assumed you understand binary numbers coding is introduced without a lot of explanation of java script syntax or methods or what actually happens when you write a line of code the idea of hiding an image within an image is interesting but i do not see that as important for beginners web developers how is this relevant to building a web site	2
its too easy id have enjoyed more challenching exercises about restful apis we have not seen any http mehotd a part of get and thats a shame	2
it was an intersting a useful course	4
great course with some	4
great course for people who want to do better with academics or training and dont know how	4
awesome course enjoying so far	4
is this a fabulous course complete that covers many areas of business strategy i recommend	4
comprehensive but also insightful i learn this course together with other learning material like statistical learning it turns out this course teaches me practical thing to do something while another course gives me just some conceptual idea what the thing is	4
the content is great and the lectures are clear but this course was made in a rush there are many bugs throughout the quizzes and there is no contact at all with the lecturer in the forums and there is no teaching stuff present in the forums	4
great for basic notions	4
simply awesome	4
its a such useful and informative course	4
better have some coding experience before	3
great course but there is a problem with  of the exams not accepting correct answers	3
massively enjoy and support this course offering well done charles severance	4
good course i liked it very useful	2
good introduction to functional programming and scala although the lectures and assignments can get rather mathy pointless proof of refactoring using maths pascals triangle huffman coding counting change etc if you dont have a mathematical background i would suggest getting the basics of programming down before starting this course so you have less to worry abouti found myself reading up about the maths behind some of the assignments before tackling them when this couldve been avoided with less mathematical assignments i looked into the first assignment of the next module in the specialization and thought to myself why bother as it just continues the trend of solving more complex mathematical problems  something rarely tackled as a professional developeri wouldve liked to see the standard collection functions taught and used more frequently map flatmap fold etc	3
the best ml course i ever took	4
thoroughly enjoyed this course the dedicated instructors emanate their love for our planet and its environment	4
great powerful content 	4
the course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting todaybeing a basic course it is very easy to follow and finish quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesnt make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocatingthe videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors spark white and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it which was downright infuriatingit still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism but needs serious improvement	2
all basic graph algorithms are covered	4
great course to know more about machine learning	4
very thought provoking inspiring and educational	4
i loved the content and found the teacher spectacular this is a really fun course to take	4
perfect	4
excellent course i really enjoyed take the classes the theacher makes them funny and easy to understand and the book provided is full of excercices and useful tips	4
excellent course very useful for all musicians great teacher john p kellog	4
understand the muslims could be the key to a better relationships in the future every country will chance its identity and muslims will fulfill that spaces in society	4
overall the information provided in the class was very valuable and up to date in describing the kinematics and dynamical control for a quadrotor	3
great sometimes i wondered why the true statistical terms  like factor analysis  were never mentioned	3
this is one of the best things ive ever seen on this matter prof andrews method os explanation is quite useful and easy to understand even if your not totally familiar with the subject	4
the course was very good learnt a lotthank you	4
very nice course easy to understand and practice	4
good introduction to agile software and software product managment	4
very good course 	3
good course	4
great	3
awesome second course from chuck he explains the material well and provides a great foundation in python and coding the mentors are responsive and helpful when you have questions and the exercises are a good level of challenge but not so difficult they are frustrating	4
very useful but i feel in some videos the teachers talk too fast	4
a very well structured cpurse a solid amount of information delivered with the pace picking up maybe a little too abruptly after week  however i did learn a lot and investing the time required was definitely worth it highly recommended	4
the course is insightful and intuitive the professors have done a great job if you are already a programmer in some other language you might find some topics a bit primitive but the project that is at the end of the module should be a good exercise even for the experienced programmers and to recreate the entire project on your own would be a great exercise it will also gear you up nicely for the next course in the specialization	4
good introduction to data science however it should have more details and practical examples about git	3
step by step guide to the real worldthanks so much for the teacher and the course	4
overall pretty solid would love a bit more feedback andor greater correlation between material and assignments but overall nice introduction to r	3
i hope you make a longer version of this maybe a part  and  it is so very well done and incredibly interesting i really enjoy the expirience and learn many things of interest the interviews where so good and helpful keep up the great job	4
good fist mooc experience pity the google hangout wasnt up but never mind would prefer more questions in the videos to check im listening attentivelywould also like to see a list of all the reading material in one place rather than per lectiure then i can go to each web page and save as epub usiing the crhome dotepub extension and copy to my ereaderanyway you can streamline that kind of admin task would be appreciated you ought to spruke ways to read the web pages because reading it on a laptop or even tablet is a bit tedious also with the pdfs some info on saving them as resizable pdfs would be appreciatedcourse content was good and i like the coursera front endneed someway to manage tthe growing library of reading material that accumalates not just with this one course but if you do multiple moocs over timethank	3
an excellent course introducing platonic philosophy along with the ideas of his predecessors such as socrates wellorganized and well presented	4
i think this course does not a good job of explaining the mathematics very well the supplementary material is very good in that regard compared to the lectures however there are too few to make up for it i would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercisesas a result my learning success is not very satisfactory	1
i am impressed and exceptionally satisfied passing the course very useful presents range of theories and points of view combined with real life cases and indepth explanations thank you	4
although the teacher must be using android phone but it does not influence its a nice lecture	3
very nice start in python	4
i started with web  back in  and did not go further with html because too many constraints for layouts back then wow css and javascript really solved many problems encountered back then thanks for a great intro to whats possible now making responsive sites	4
this course increased my thirst of learning in a new field	3
again a course that comes with very simple and not always good prepared video lectures but for recieving a grade an enormous math knowledge is necessary with no further help given	0
good information given thanks	4
taking the learning how to learn class was one of the best decisions ive made in the past ten years regarding maintaining my skills current and relevant to my professional life in high tech i used to fall prey to a sense of being perennially behind regarding the amount of technical knowledge i need to master for my work since my university days my modus operandi used to be repetition and brute force ie more or less crammingafter this class i now have a set of tools i can actually relate to i can use them proficiently to learn smarter retain information better and foremost understand what my particular cues are if procrastination gets in my way again i cannot thank drs oakley and sejnowski enough for the deliberate pace of this course they carefully pared down its content with luminously clear explanations often delivered with a downtoearth approach sprinkled with humori sincerely hope that this small message of gratitude will encourage whomever is on the fence to register for the course by the way by requesting a certificate of completion i felt that i hadskin in the gamei had a deadline to honor whether tired or pressed for time knowing that i had paid the modest sum for my certificate encouraged me to make time for myself to go through each lesson carefully and learn the special vocabulary associated with these new toolsvery best wishes to all you will be so happy you took the time to go through the classsincerelycatherine von dennefeldnapa ca	4
perfect workiam soooooo happy duo to connecting to this course	4
great course good workload to do the course in the evening after a workdayhighly recommended	4
an excellent course on applied cryptography	4
very good good the professor is super brilliant and funny what an attractive course	4
crazy i love professor	4
i really enjoyed this course the material and videos were carefully made and very informative the assignments were made that you can properly use the content learned from the lessons the mentorinstructors are very knowledgeable it goes without saying the instructors are reference in the algorithms fieldit is worth saying the assignments may require you to research extra resources eg algorithms th book	4
this course basically treats you like an extremely slowlearning retarded individual totally waste of your time by watching a bunch of videos the contents are so thin all the contents covered in these course videos can be summarized in a minute video if you have a lot of time you dont know how to spend enroll in	1
great lecturer	4
really applicable course great teaching skills	4
the most terrible course i have ever seen in my life and on this site for some of quiz questions you feel like you are dumb because you can not make connection between lectures and quizzes i really wanted to learn java on coursera but it seems impossible to me focusing on rbg values and image thingies too much and making me feel uncomfortable at quizzes after watching all those lectures are the main reasons of giving  star	0
the course was awesome	4
extremelly clearifying the directions are comprehensible and the course helped me to increase the job opportunities dramatically	4
lack of support from course teaching staff in answering students questions	0
a real learning process well explained and easy to follow	4
the course is excellent	4
the contents are extremely useful and the lecture is clear the programming assignments are challenging	4
very helpful thanks	4
eye opener how i wish i had early access to this material very much recommended	4
enjoyable course good pointers to learn for me it was a good break from studying hard getting a little mental pause while learning to learn	3
i have learned so much from this course thanks to coursera and university of alberta this course is highly recommended for students with a passion for evolution and phylogeny the handouts are also very useful	3
fairly well presented in that different points of view on the questions were put forward i found it interesting and informative to learn how better to choose compare and charitiesunfortunately there seems to be a dominate premise that is this course insists one must give up the maximum part of ones income to charities who will do the job to help others for you in this i disagree and have not changed fundamentally in my perceptionhaving said that one does come away with more motivation to think about and to act more altruistically as the occasions present themselves	3
excellent course telling also why part	4
i quite appreciate the teaching of american philosophers like emerson or rorty	3
can we get ed hesse to do some classes he was my favorite part in a very interesting series on design thinking	4
a very good course the theories are explained well in the lectures and the assignments cover the learned information without being too difficult	4
the course is useful help everybody who want to design a questionnaire the course content an overview about methodological issues measurement errors as a consequence of skip some considerations in design the questions or the mode chosen the project of the course which you have to draft a questionnaire speed up the learning process in general the course delivery what it is promise	4
i learn a lot of things in python thats why i vote  stars	4
very bad introduction to python and almost nothing about raspberry pi itself	0
thank you dr chuck	4
it was pretty good but most of the information is rehashed briefly in the intro to r programming	2
excellent course i wish there was more evaluations or points taken from the videos perhaps requirements to evaluate them compare them and get observations form fellow students and teachersi noticed that george sometimes had no reaction to gina n some of the videos and perhaps this was necessary in order to make sure he stood on neutral ground like to have had georges thoughts on thisalso perhaps one video going through the whole process from beginning to end would have helped show a complete modelbut this course is one of the best i have ever taken and i want to thank john hopkins university and coursera for providing itjack comer	4
very good videos and not too detailed explanations	4
i am a grad student and i am still learning how to learn this course has been very informative and i have used it to analyze my own learning routines and hopefully improve barbara is very clear and concise and i enjoyed herlectures and the material	4
very interesting historical background and a paced clear presentation of the musical techniques employed by the pianists very enjoyable if you are a classical music lover	4
good introduction to seo	4
thank you it is a very useful course	4
great course except it seemed little effort was put into explaining the python side of the week  and  material	3
good video and learning materialthanks for ng	4
excellent course it is well organized and should be a required course for anyone thinking of starting a new business or simply wanting to increase hisher value to their organization the concepts apply to small and large organizations whether for profit or nonprofit even nonprofits are in a competitive market	4
i really enjoyed the course and would highly recommend it to others interested in the subject matter some may find it basic but i found it very useful as the theory is explained in a manner such that it can be applied in a very practical way	4
excelllent teacher and course congratulations	4
i found this course really interesting broad the views and concept of dairy management 	4
great beginner course to kickstart knowledge to start a healthy eating lifestyle	4
absolutely fantastic course well balanced well paced and filled with useful information	4
great course great introduction for beginners like me 	4
thats a great course for the beginner	4
this course opened a new chapter for me and introduced to me something that i have never considered i plan on studying the whole series the course is very well taught all the principles theories and scientific basis of waste management and the way for the future is very well done thank you for a most interesting introduction to this very environmentally important subject and necessity	4
quality course with enough practice	4
i learned a lot very interesting educative relevant and up to date issuesinfos eventhough it is not a  course the structure of the course makes a lot of sense i enjoyed the teacher easy to listen to this course taugh me as expect about international politics through topics such as the difficult situation of gas pipelines however it also encouraged me dig deaper on subject that should matter to any citizen in fact i found myself researching about my countrys energy mix or recent green buildings in my city finally i learned about technical and alternative option such as portable and safe nuclear energy it did not even cross my mind that nuclear would be anything else than huge reactors tricky to stop	4
it is very useful for both unviersity students and employers and employees at work the content is a bit short and it will be great if there are more contents on pronunciation and grammar thanks	4
first of all let me congratulate the team for starting this course on epidemics pandemic and outbreaks it was a very nice and i could come to know about the epidemics which occurred throughout the globe i have a suggestion i feel that this the course may be more detailed especially about the problems of developing countries like malaria measles etc my sincere thanks to all my teachers please keep in touch	3
really good course clear and well prepared	4
great course lots of work but you learn soo much definitely recommend it to all potential law school hopefuls like me	4
very accessibly thanks	4
the lectures are well explained but the programming exercises are too basic  expected the programming assignments to be more challenging  good course but each week could be completed by  hours  and the  week course can be completed within  week by casual work  but its a good introduction to access web data using python  recommended for beginners 	3
awesome lessons easy to get on hand and every piece of ml is crystal clearly explained	4
sometimes when i worked the spreadsheets out the data differed from that on the examples the items in the course were good and built up well some more details would have been nice the instructor went over some spreadsheet steps quite fast	3
great course	4
it is the best course i believe the certificate is surely going to be beneficial for my career	4
very good course change my view on studying 	4
perfect for beginners wellpaced clear interesting fun	4
very good material and overview however still a little bit too basic fundamental management systems hands on should be much more intensive	3
great instructor high	3
very very interesting course	4
excellent course really inspired me to learn more	4
great course	4
i enjoyed this course i feel that it covered enough data correlated with this career path to provide for efficient and thorough project manager skills i thought the videos were very researched and properly displayed i also feel as though the curriculum was well researched and selected thank you for having me in this course	4
good overall information about small personal flocks as well as the commercial use of chickens for eggs and meat	4
i really thank to coursera community and university of california davis for organizing this useful course i reccomend all the students who are studying engineering majorscome on friends and join us	4
loved itinteractive learning and good implementation of all the theory taughtwould recommend everyone to check it out	4
good course	3
its absolute grate	4
amazing easy to understand 	4
love this class on graphic design learned different types of imagemaking never new the different types or what they were called	4
a very detailed course on regression with real data examples and which exposes the student to actual coding of different functions rather than using already available functions i got a very satisfying learning experience	4
this course is amazing i need to rethink about my future career after the course	4
very good introductory course that allowed me to understand key body system high quality lectures understandable for beginners with desire to get better understanding how body functions	4
great learning experience thanks	4
the best course i have ever taken online fyi this was my first course online too a year ago but till date this is the best course i have ever taken it taught me valuable programming skills i was the kid who knew nothing about programming before this course now i am taking third part of this specialization	4
well donevery clear and useful	4
very nice introduction to databases and data warehouses the lectures are not very engaging the plus is there are practical assignments for every week where you learn the most first you submit your own solution and then you provide feedback to your peers i like the format of the assignments what i dislike giving  stars instead of  is difficulty in setting up the environment for assignments to complete  it took me longer just to properly install the software needed for assignments  and  than to work out the assignments the lectures could be also improved	3
a thorough and comprehensive course with many excellent worked examples	4
helped me get a grip on time at work	3
very strong introduction	4
best machine learning mooc 	4
very steep path from proffesionalov i learned a lot the information understandable and memorable thanks to the authors of an interesting course	4
it has been a pretty useful course to me as i needed to start from scratch in understanding the research methods	4
the course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments however this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given the problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader which should definitely be improved some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another same purpose or you spend our to manipulate a pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement for instance so if you want to take it prepare to fight with the grader positive point excellent help on the forums you will not be left alone	2
such professional tutors carefully chosen diction	4
this course is jam packed full of helpful information i like how the instructor sits and looks at us the leaner and talks it helps feeling relaxed while learning i feel i have learned more with this method	4
great based on practice a very good start	4
great plate do start with css congrats to all envolved	4
just great this course details most of the machine learning algorithms and also provides handson experience with the implementation of those algorithms	4
amazing course great professors lecturers and material essential course for those interested in international tax law	4
teachers are really responsive to questions that were mentioned in the forum and they provided me with a good start in philosophy i would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in philosophy but has no previous experience this course will lead you to the a different world	4
i learnt a lot although i have to finish this course soon	4
this course has given me a basic knowledge of different tools and statistical techniques that data scientist use to play with data	3
thank you	4
great introductory course strongly recommend anyone thinks to pursue their career in this area	4
this is something really great and i appreciate all the efforts of the creators of that course especially dr charles severance who has an amazing ability of imparting his knowledge in a very colourful and enjoyable way while fully substantively and clearlythis is my first ever online course and if the remaining parts are conducted in similar way i am more than impatient to start it immediately it is a pity it is  am and one more thing  this course as well as the book is indeed for the very beginners however with some ability of logical thinking if you are not such a very beginner it will take just couple of days to finish it as it was in my caseso listen carefully what dr chuck is saying read the book take look at the slides and other available stuff and dont hesitate to start and dont give up if something goes wrong	4
great learning experience thanks coursera and barbara fredrickson	4
understanding of machine learning made so easy	4
its fun so and its easy i really love the way that drchuck teach the lessons especially the magic part  lol hence i highly recommended this course to people who never contact to coding however its too easy to students who have learnt c java but still its an excellent course	3
learning techniques this course introduced to me are extremely amazing and i think i will apply them all to my study and life thank you very much	4
the class is good but the content in the class is not that muchi think more complex project to solve some interesting tasks in homework will be better	3
great approach to the course	3
a lot of fun and a working project at the end with which to experiment with various parallelism strategies	4
i can not express my gratitude to both of you dear professors i am also grateful to all of the interviewers they really rich the course with their experiencesthanks again	4
well structured course great videos and materials really enjoyed the tasks and assignments who thought you could have fun programming 	4
excellent programme basic introduction of concepts like gross domestic product and purchasing power parity presented in a relaxed way along with video footagedefinitely worth your time	4
awesome course it covers the basics in very dynamic and easy to digest sessions if you have previous programming experience you will still enjoy this course if your dont this is the right course for you to start dipping your toes into the world of programming enjoy	4
excellent i would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in digital marketing or digital strategy development	4
first time taking a programming course i was able to understand the basic concepts of python codding and i am looking forward to the next course python data structures i hope to get a better understanding on how to apply python to real world situations when i conclude all the courses availablei am very excited thanks prof chuck and ctas	4
very nice lecturers the course level is rather intermediate	4
very practical course extensively covered machine learning topics	4
i can get more knowledge about tenses and modaleasy simple and very good	4
very useful any knowledge acquiring course	4
at the beginning i wasnt sure about the teacher but he turned out to be amazing	4
very clear and easy to follow	4
learnt a lot about india which i had no clue whatsoever earlier well structured course	4
just the same as the first course mediumhard quizzes and a hard programming assigment that is actually harder to understand than to developoverall a five star course	4

outstanding course andrew is an exceptional teacher making difficult and complex topics easy to understand the course is very well structured in a way that there are no questions left unanswered and you can have a really indepth understanding of the topics by just watching the videos and paying close attention i have a degree in electrical engineering so it was quite easy to follow the course but i believe that even people with no programmingengineeringmathematical background would benefit from this course because andrew makes it easy to understand the concepts and the algorithms formulations the programming assignments really provides a good practical approach for all the theory given in the video lectures and the code templates are very well structured to enable even someone with no background in programming to complete the tasks the functions used and implemented can then be adapted for implementing your own machine learning problems overall great course i am very satisfied with it	4
prof idan segev taught the course with an understanding that he will have an audience from a variety of backgrounds and hence the course was balanced between mathematical and biological concepts his enthusiasm regarding the topics he taught was what got me gripped and as a physics major thinking about a career in biophysics the biophysical concepts he taught hodkinhuxley model ralls model concepts in computational neuroscience made me ever more interested in my career choicethumbs up to prof segev and his team for a truly inspiring and enjoyable course hope you do other courses in the future	4

its so hard for beginners in my opinion	1
i loved the way of teaching of prof aric it never felt to me like i was attending some formal classroom session because the way that he teaches is so casual and i loved the examples that he gave with each lesson it was very helpful to understand new unfamiliar things better also i loved the way the course is being designed though i missed the course inbetween due to some personal reasons i had the option to continue the course at a different time with the next batch as per me this was the best part about the course	4
the course is interesting and you can learn a lot the professor is very knowledgeable in the area of search engines however the course goes very early into mathematical details without too much context the programming assignments are great and i would focus more on them as they really show you how the engine works	3

another excellent class in the series straightforward information about transforming social media marketing knowledge into an ongoing program	4
good and interesting course i think it should have a bit more formalization for example in html part there was no information about wc validation tool also for example there was no accent on some essential parts of html according the wc specification the src attribute of img tag must be present there was no accent that for attribute of label tag should correspond to the id of form element so in homework review i saw situations when this attribute was set to name instead of id	4
an exceptional course in intermediary programming	4

i took this course to prepare for the interview for the mfe program in columbia and i am so excited to see these two professors in person in this fall cool course quite intro level but practical to take for the preparation for interviews	4
gets way too indepth with the math behind regression to the point that it deters from the learning process was hoping to learn better methods of interpreting or enacting regression not the inner workings of the algorithmsassignments got overly complex with confusing instructions there are definitely some leaps made in the assumptions of what students python capabilities are vague instructions caused more frustration than desire to continue learningwill continue in the specialization but will not hesitate to drop out if instruction continues like thisvery disappointed	0
this is an outstanding course which covers such a wide range of energies including wind solar and a large variety of biofuels i was impressed with the selection of different presenters who were all specialists in their field the level of technical detail is appropriate for a layman while being quite in depth in fact in some cases one might feel overwhelmed but this was intended in order to give a good feeling of the innovative technologies problems and futures it was good to review the well known energy sources like nuclear hydro fracking corn ethanol etc but i would say most people are unaware of all these alternative sources of energy such as from various plants algae to make biofuels or electricitythe questionnaires were both helpful in forcing one to pay sufficient attention even if sometimes they are near impossible to get  on  also i thought the interviews were especially well prepared and helpful to recall the basic material presented bravo	4
absolutely brilliant amazing	4
an awesome way to begin to learn chinesethanks very much 	4
this was a fun introduction to typography i really enjoyed the assignments and the informative lessons	4
i am very happy this course is available it would have been a great help  years ago as i started working in the wind energy industry	4
i think it is really necessary to establish better the target auditory for this course the students with very basic level of english have to study with advanced nonnative speakers and with natives the exercises can be too challenging for the first category sometimes boring for the second and absolutely superfluous for the third	1
very useful it can help open peoples mind about how easy might be start of a new future business shown how important role play our mindset and decisionmaking process which is for most of people very difficult	4
this course covers very useful material with clarity since it has run for multiple iterations the content is very polished and it makes participating easy and smooth	4
with no competitors i think this is one of the most interesting courses of the entire specialization	4
good and useful content but some problems in vids	2
the equationsmath could have been delivered in a much better way	2
its better than the first course of this specialization but as i mentioned in the survey i think lesson  that includes  huge parts of pmbok is not a great thing	3
very interesting and engaging course	3
an informative and nicely structured course recommend those who want to gather precise knowledge about epidemiology	4
highly instructive im glad i took this online course	4
this is an extremely basic course in my opinion it isnt worth  and is thrown in just to add to the total price of the specialization it is a useful refresher but doesnt really contain much information just a couple of topics are covered at a very basic level you could also get this info from watching youtube videos	2
it is conceptual compared to other courses however it brings a lot in increasing our selfawareness very much appreciated	3
very good and useful introduction logistic regression could have been expanded a little more so that we can start using it	4

out of all the courses i have followed in coursera so far this course provided by the yonsei university is far more than satisfaction perhaps its because of the way the professor teaches in which i love the most because she is very clear detailed and amiable in her lectures and she sounds interesting and not boring at allto be honest i understood a lot and i took this course mostly to know about the marketing in hospitality and i grasped an essential amount of information thanks to the professor of the yonsei universityand im about to take the course again as wellthank you	4

this is a thorough course on questionnaire design i have found it very rewarding for those who are interested in research knowledge after completing this part of the course i am left wanting to attempt at least some of the other parts particularly those dealing with data analysis and hopefully learn about soft ware that might be available as an aid to data analysis i recommend the course to those who desire to approach their research assignments in a more scientific wayby way of a general comment i would suggest that course material and examples be as internationally representative as possible some of the presentations assume that participants understand the american social developments and the research preoccupations	3

really good course be professor chaikin is very thorough in his explanations of the different steps towards understanding html css and javascript the course left me with the feeling that though we learned a lot there was still much more to learn with a course like this you get out what you put in so i highly recommend committing yourself to doing the assignments and keeping up with examples while prof chaikin is explaining them it helps a lot if you following along using your own code editor and browser sync	4
the course is exhaustive and enjoyable not even  years of mba can teach us these concepts with so much flair	4
simply lovely and useful and mind broadening  i loved it	4

very good onebut visualization could have been done with matplotlib or other plotting libraries	4
i completed the course in about three days ive never programmed before to the learning curve was excruciating but nonetheless i managed to get through and finally get my python feet wet so to speak	4
the class would have been better if the financing optionsstrategies had been further categorized according to different stages of development of the startup i liked most of the content nevertheless speaking of issues like ipo and several stages of funding did not seem relevant to a great majority of startups at least for early stage ones as figures demonstrated in the class many failed and the mostly adopted early stage funding options is from family  friendsanyway it really was a great class intense interesting and important in entrepreneurship thank you	4

i thought that they could have gone more in depth in terms of metrics how to calculate them and use them in real life situations the course seemed to focus too much on the type of companies that use data as well as what type of jobs there are in this field i didnt find it too relevant or helpful in terms of making me more productive at work	2

great intro to python ive had some formal training in c matlab and i completed the codecademy section of python a while back this was a nice reintroduction to python but more formal the only complaint i have is with the grader i had no issues running my programs from my terminal but the grader kept giving me indentation issues not sure what the problem was but it was a pain to deal with considering the code worked in other places aside from that the lectures are quick and helpful and the examples are helpful as well	4

there is lack of communication with peers and mentors its like styding alone	3
really i like this course because you can learn more with the software created for this seminary but i would like that this course would have a second part that would be awesome	3
it was painful to work through the videos at first place for more than one reasons very linmited i would say insufficient and inconsistent use of background data diagrams equations symbolspointers on the board to support what was been talked about it felt like a plain reading of mathematical expressions and descriptions as a consequence i had to completely rely on the www to learn the topics covered so i could do the exercises if that is how the standard of tutoring is to unfold for uol global mba program to which this is a foundation i would seriously reconsider my decision to go for i have been into a mooc ucl and regret to say this course quantitative foundations for international business is a big disappointment hope someone listens and th	0

this is course is really awesome and i would recommend it to anyone who is interested to software engineering using java programming languagea little history about my background will help understand my excitement about this course i am a newly graduated in the field of electrical engineering so far i wrote code mainly in c and i have not really participated to very challenging programming assignments looking for job unluckily so far  i quickly realize that java programming is really big on the job market for these reasons i got this book in java programming called starting out with java but may be due to lack of discipline i was not really able to move deeply in bookhowever since i have enrolled in this course i am being influenced tremendously by the design of the classi got so much positive vibe from the professor who make this class really exciting the level of details use in lecture videos make this class really easy to follow in addition the class assignment are just plainly cool practical and challenging i really feel like i am learning from expert in the field this fact has raised my confidence that my gaining the skills combined in this specialization i magnify my qualification on the job marketthank you	4
the content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practicethere is just one aspect i philosophically disagree with yet this is a pivotal point in education the course assumes that education is a way to change behaviour as an external factoryet i am more inclined to the philosophy of education is to lift man up from the animal state and by this uplift man will change his own relationship with the world internal factorthe theory and practice given in this course are still valuable though regardless of this difference in viewpoint	3
a great course about nordic film and tv media i learn a lot and decide to watch some works mentioned in the course	4
material is intense but the instructor does a great job explaining and simplifying a complex topic into a easy to understand course the projectsassignment are challenging but fulfilling and ties back to the course materials i highly recommend doing the assignment to get a full understanding	4
excellent i got a degree in machine learning at ucl and both during and after my studies i found clear explanations from professor andrew ng when i most needed them the course is designed this way each thing taught by andrew is tested evaluated so one can monitor hisher advance all the time i myself am a teacher in my country and think that this is the way a teacher should design his courses creating resources to monitor the learning of the students on the go all the time with plenty of simple exercises together with few difficult projects and tests	4
awesome  i am glad to have this opportunity and got a chance to learn from the very learned person like him 	4
good level of detail and math for application use though not for theoretical analysis	3
well structured lessons and basics concepts to learn the course is absolutely accessible for everyone and all the concepts and words are perfectly explained with a lot of examples also mention that the spoken english is quite easy to understand thanks to a good pronunciation and excellent pacing in any case you can enable the subs if you need them	4
there are serious issues with the quizzes other than grading correctincorrect there is no feedback afterwards	2

good course really helps me	4
very instructive and enjoyable i look forward to more such opportunities	4
the teaching content is not at the same level of what required to complete the final project which frustrated the beginners and also stop me from finishing the whole course what a pity	2
the data scientists toolbox is a great way to dip into data science and the methodology behind it the course is very general and makes an effort to cover the bigger scope of things without delving deep in any more than anything its a great way to learn the components and uses of data science and set a framework for all that will be coming afterthe materials are very well laidout and almost feel like attending college classes the visuals and slides are a little dry but the pace is lively enough to maintain momentum at all times	3
great course	4
this was a very exciting course giving an insight into data modelling challenges working with databases and visualization of data and showing smart ways of how python can making our lives much easier by automating processes around databases the course also covers the basic terminology of object orientated programming making it a good liaison with whats been discussed in the previous lectures	4
very informative	3
awesome course	4
i enjoyed the course very fun playing with the unity editor and the assignments give you some freedom in how you tackle assignments the class was fairly easy and doesnt need much time commitment	4
great course recommended	4
once again another excellent course from dr chuck however the coursera format has changed from that of the previous two courses and the submission of quizzes and assignments are now locked they dont show progress or get marked as completed unless you purchase the certification so if youre auditing the course dont bother with the quizzes and dont expect the course to show your progress mine still says im on week one or be marked as completed in your profile even though youve watched all the videos and submitted the assignmentsdr chuck i understand that university of michigan has to find a way to monetize these courses however since the previous courses used auto graders and this course seems to as well id like to request that the quiz and assignment features be unlocked so auditors can see course progress and completion like the previous two courses	3
pretty basic but good	2
great course thank you dariusz	4
it is clear amusing and practical the learning tools it provides are really powerfull and they work in real life and is very funny too i just loved it	4

engaging and interesting course from the coolest professor youll ever have	4
useful nice and good	4
pretty good course	4
very useful course for those who want to learn what is behind econometric tools and what their limitations are the combination between practice and theory makes it an exciting learning experience that is worth the time investment for those like myself that were not  up to speed at the start a significant time investment is needed to finish the course i had to spend in excess of  hours a week to satisfactorily understand the material and be able to reproduce the main takeaways i am sure the course can be successfully completed with less effort but grasping the essence of the material made sense to me as i am trying to get a better idea of how to use econometric tools conclusion it is completely worth your time but if you are not sufficiently well versed in math and statistics basic college level you will need to make a significant time investment to make full use of the material	4
the flow and content of this course is fantastic its engaging thoughtprovoking and really keeps your interest throughoutit is evident that the course leaders have a real passion for this subject and its an infectious trait for the learners too	4
it is very useful	4

i liked this information but i wouldnt call it a courseim a certified pt and i benefit from the information but many books have been written about the subjects as welli personally loved the information given as it gave me a touchup on my knowledge and tips to give to my clients	4
gotta watch how the test questions are formulate as it can be overly deceiving	3
this course was very helpful as someone new to social marketing and with a product vowed religious life in a monastery that is unusual its been really helpful to think about the different strategies for reaching different people for instance i realized that the most visible part of my audience is other vocation ministers  but theyre the competition not the real audience this course is helping me to probe deeper to find the people who really might some day knock on the door of the monastery and ask to enter im grateful for the support	4
a solid foundation course for anyone who wishes to pursue machine learning	4
very useful for any student who wants to improve the way he learns	3
good explaining very basic stuff readings are basically the same as lectures but maybe help to really remember the knowledge i recommend it for beginners in the area	3
so clear and objective love it	4
very helpful	4
wonderful course very helpful	4
i like the course it is pretty good to learn screenplay butthey need to explain a little some topics that new writers maybe dont understand submerge more in some topics and explain it	2

good course	4
the best	4
although some matters are presented quite broadly and generically some others are exhaustive and of practical usage especially the ones supported by documents and references very useful	3

this covers provides excellent coverage of the most fundamental concepts of frontend development the presentation style in the lectures was very clear and easy to understand and the information in the lectures themselves particularly the ones on css and javascript was quite comprehensive i have learned much more about css than i ever knew before and have even been able to apply that knowledge in my fulltime job as a software engineer this has all been possible thanks to this course i highly recommend this course to anyone who is looking to understand much more about frontend development	4
great	4
the course was well laid out had us tread old ground in a great way especially with those of us who are already int he field or took the earlier courses in the graphic design specialization by forcing us to look at the basics as we solved design problems while its great that people review and are even left tips and hints on how to leave a helpful review i do wish there was some sort of word limit even a minimal one for them because oftentimes getting a review like great or nice while heartening dont actually help the student learn about what the person liked about their design or what failed	3
good one for beginner i learned how to use pyhon	4
great teacher and excellent materials really helps a lot for a total beginner	4
a great course 	4

excellent course highly recommended for all my friends	4

why should i waste my time listening to someone reading a book to me	0
new inovative and aimed to an important factor that will affect the future generations and ours	4
this course its exactly what i needed the teacher has a great talent to simplify otherwise difficult topics and you can see she knows what shes talking about and gives you perfectly coherent arguments to justify her interpretation of the ancient greeks philosophy	4
excellent way of teaching	3
have certain degree of difficulty	3
the best video and slide and funny straightforward way of teaching easy to understand	4
great way to get started with python	4

great intro to objectivec	4
i was looking for a statistical software other than r and i found that after taking this course it served as a good primer as well	4
excellent course with good video lectures however the written course materials especially in terms of slides and assignment instructions suffer from poor grammar and an occasional lack of clarity	3
professor impey covers an extensive subject using a clear and instigating language the assignments and tasks proposed helps a lot the comprehension and make you search for more informationone of the best online courses i have already hadcongratulations to professor impey and all team that produced the available material	4
nicely paced course for beginners to java programming and the programming assignments are really exciting	4
i am a statistician who works primarily with r with some python for the things python is better for i know how to program but i explicitly note i am not a computer science student i have only limited experience with the command prompt i was very excited when i heard about this course but the amount of work and frustration just to get started programming in scala has been obscene i am very very glad i decided to check out the course for free before paying for the specializationthe course has a lot of required software the tutorials to get this software often involve you need this but so save time were going to skip showing you how to get it if it doesnt work you need to install it there is a lot of variability in oss many errors are often encountered there is no helpamong the things the course requires are two three ides for scala i note the video tutorials says you just need some sort of ide but you need intellij and eclipse to submit the guides show how to get started on a mac the software is not the same on windows and so step by step instructions become a guessing game because many options or menus are missing or differentthere are many better and more friendly guides on the internet i may return to the transcripts of the course content here but i wont be submitting any coursework im going to warn my colleagues away as well forget coursera  ill just buy a book and work through it like everyone else i know	0
thank you for a very in	3
i just completed my week  and it just very interesting i love it	4
the concept is very important so its good that this course is available the videos are sometimes not that great of quality its okay to show recordings of lectures but the sound is of less qualityanother thing is that the teacher says a lot of euhm i know he cannot help that but once you notice this it becomes a bit annoying	3

a step by step course designed to pay attention all the time with tons of practical examples and very clear explanations i would definitely recommend it	4
great format	4
im almost finished with all of the lectures and the course gives a really good introduction to the topic what i like is that at the beginning of each video the learner is provided with a recap of the essence of this course and a short summary of the previous lecture its perfect for beginners and the level is not too demanding at all	4
well explained informative course	3
one of the best modules where you can learn how to apply the knowledge	4
while this course was interesting it seemed very light there was only about  or so minutes of content a week plus some interviews which were very interesting but didnt feel as though they taught too much the assignments were all good except for the third one about the physical object it was a weird prompt and not in a good wayi would recommend this course but id also love to see it expanded a bit	3
it is necessary more examples for to understand more clearly the topics	3
this was one of the most interesting coursers so far especially the game part id definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn how to understand political behavior	4
good refresher	3
easy to start	4
i love this courseyou get a lot of practice and the instructor explains the theory of things really well	4
wow i learned so much in this course i was able to apply what i was learning every week to my teaching and i am telling you every week i was seeing instant positive results in my classes by applying what i learned in this course freaking amazing i was drowning so to speak up until i found this course because i was teaching but i didnt really know how to teach but when youre abroad the opportunity to teach is so available people will hire you without much experience at all but i found myself wanting to give more to my students than just a warm body in the room i wanted to make it fun and interesting for them and i wanted them to actually learn stuff too i didnt quite know how to go about it i didnt know which techniques were good andor bad this course in a nutshell taught me all of that and more great stuff best money spent this year so worth the money seeing how much i got back from it immediately	4
great thanks	4

great materials and lectures for starters would be better if there are more exercises	4
excellent course practical and useful should be considered by people who aware or what is important nor aware about digital world and corresponding benefits and	4
although overall the course is interesting it is clear that it has not been designed for mooc format a clear structure for learning lacks and some of the lectures seem to be more about the people talking about their own work than trying to convey general concepts in the drug discovery field i think the course would benefit from more structure in the way the lessons are presented starting with a more general outline of what a good drug is etcetera however there are some interesting concepts i can take along in my further studies but i am slightly disappointed	2
the way professor mr g siedel conducted the course is very practical and useful invites always to think about answers to complex questions and his new approaching techniques to negotiate with success are truly useful to analyze your behave negotiating and therefore  improve in the negotiation techniques and knowledge of tools and different approaches to a negotiation	3

this course was absolutely fantastic i cannot say enough good things about it i could go on and on about the wonderful things about it but i would rather keep this short and to the point if you are reading this review take this course	4
a very essential course that all educators authors academicians and librarians should take	4
decent overview but could have spend more time showing plotting techniques in more detail than showing what makes an appealing plot also the section on the backend of matplotlib was more detailed than it needed to be for quick overview but not detailed enough to be very useful	2
very nice course it would have been nice if even the remote storage was added into this curriculum	4
the preceding courses were interesting and helpful this capstone project lacked substance the project did not allow itself to apply many of the concepts learned throughout the course its almost exclusively about customer analytics i would not be surprised if yahoo worked with wharton and coursera to launch this course in order to crowdsource ideas on how to turn around the company	0

not very motivating way of talking about the topic also its getting old hes lecture is sometimes colored like a stereotypical texan his extrapolations as flawed as those of the eia which by now can be seen with hindsight	1
good pointers but not a lot of unique new insights a lot of this is based on building any team not unique to data science	3
this was a very interesting module other than giving out imporant information to question ourselves as language teacher it encouraged us to think again and review how is it that we are really performing as teachers are we asking the right questions are we thinking of the best ways to enroll our students on leargning languages are we wnjoying our labourall of the lessons provided not only gave information to improve our classes but gave us the opportunity to wonder what can we do better and how can we be better as teachersthank you	4
too short too expensive	2
huge difference reading feedback from peers videos short and sweet will love to have recommended extra reading videos etc	4

i am a philology major student and i can say that this course made me fall in love with mathematics from the very first lesson it is easy to follow the explanations are very clear and the tests are doable even for those who have not solved a single maths problem in years in this case one will probably need to refresh some basic things but it will not take long because many of the school basics are also explained in the beginning of the course thank you professor fowler for these wonderful  weeks of calculus 	4

jumping through the abbreviations sometimes forgetting to mention what it is at all also the second professor was to difficult to u	2
while the content common predictive regression and classification algorithms and tools like xlminer was useful little to no support was provided in the forums the assignments in week  and week  in particular were either vague or had errors that nobody double checked and coursetakers had to use trial and error approach to get answers right	1
genialawesome	4
great course enjoyed a lot	4
absolutely lovely wonderful and incredibly engaging course i developed a habit to watch the lecture on my way to and from work and couple of times almost missed my stop to get out i used to listen to classical music before taking the course because i simply liked the feel it created this course has allowed me to listen to it more intelligently to know and recognize more of what i actually hear and in case of postmodern music explained nicely what are the elements that over time have become reasons for me not really liking itlong story short i use this course as an example to tell friends how amazing coursera is	4
excellent foundation well divided and paced excited to continue following courses	4
great course	4
wonderful course well designed content exercise and assignment only that difficulties of the assignment could be improved so as to ensure bette learning we want more challenge lol	4

professor ng is a great teacher his course is both challenging and satisfying the exercises require you to take one step beyond the lecture  not just parrot back the transcript  you have to think about the implications of what youve just studied yet ngs presentations are lucid and informative and that next step is obvious once you think about itmy greatest challenge is that although i have been programming for decades ive only dabbled in a functional language like octave and my last math class dates back to the s however the math requirements are not onerous and im struggling through the octave assignments with some successalthough the course is  weeks there are more than  lectures as some weeks have two complete sets of lectures plus there are assignments every week that take a few hours to complete so while there is a little more work in this course than in other coursera offerings there is great value for the money and time spentif youre interested in machine learning this course is a great place to start	4

wow i cant believe its finally over this course has been fun and uplifting to learn not only does he explain extremely difficult concepts and algorithms like theyre just easy rudimentary concepts but he also gives advice on improving applications developed using sid algorithms and gave me such a great intuition on learning algorithms i got confident to work with math again professor nguyen is a genius and has opened up doors for me which i had convinced myself were beyond my grasp i currently cant afford to pay for it but would recomend you buy the certificate im going to buy it asap not just for certification but also out of appreciation for the great material and life changing experience	4
its the best course ever	4

very goodi have finished it	4
theres so much history ive learned from this course that i never learned from my history courses back in my k years on top of that ive come to love india more than i previously did and previously i loved india enough to study hindi and hinduism at my university so that says a lot	4
fascinating informative thought provoking makes you think what more could you ask for from a course the professors are wonderful im so glad i choose to take this course	4
i really enjoyed this course it was informative and thought provoking biotechnology has always humbled me always we call ourselves superior evolved organisms but one chemical group can turn us off some organism a virus which is not even as big as two lines of our fingerprint can kill us i wonder if we are manipulating nature or nature is manipulating us in greater speedi also wonder we should have stone inscriptions of our findings that can stay centuries later to tell the world of the future our stories than software and hardware which might not stand strong against calamitiesoverwhelmed humbled by all the information	4
wondered how this would be at the start but finally i would like to say a word astounding no other words simply superfluous	4
interesting course simple but useful material	3
i thought this course will be a bit more helpful there were some good methods i learned like the pomodoro and other concepts i want aware of before dr terry sejnowski might be very knowledgeable but he cant read a teleprompter and it makes his videos very hard to focusoverall it was a good course	2
most of the effort in the creation of this course seems to have gone into the visual and acoustic effects of the slides the first weeks material has no substance whatsoever literally the second week s presentations are just listings of lengthy definitions and best practices which in fact are mostly goals not practiceswith the poor quality of the provided videos my hope was that the reading would be better but the second weeks reading are uncommented links to a  page nist document an open online course and owasp materialat this point it is clear that continuing the course is not going to help me in the way i would expect it from a course when i compare this to the excellent software security course of michael hicks university of maryland  which i also attend on coursera there are worlds between bothi understand that cybersecurity and its ten domains addresses students with less prior knowledge but especially for such students i would expect a much better didactic approachone star seems harsh but after the first two weeks the only words i find for this are seriously	0
very interesting course	4
content is good lectures can be more user friendly	3
awesomely presented a semester course packed in a shortcourse you need to be a tech savvy to follow the concepts	4
on line courses are the best way of acquiring knowledge its very convenient easy and economical	4

amazing course every one should take	4
when the course started it was very interesting i really enjoyed learning about how the brain functions and how memory works barbara oakly was greathowever towards the end of the course i found that it got boring and not that stimulating maybe the parts dedicated to test preparation and studying should have been shorter	2

sometimes need more words in tasks so it can help understand it better	3
this is an advanced course and there are a lot of things that geoffrey hinton talks about casually which one has to read more about on ones own the knowledge and clarity of the instructor is beyond doubt top notch this course if quiet exhaustive and perhaps the best course on neural networks	4
i am very satisfied with the quality of this course its materials the videos	4
thats a good course a little bit repetitive if you have already studied about mkt but it presents new concepts interesting cases and give you some updates about what is happening in the market regarding the ps	3
great course and easy to understand	4
great work	4
i dont think i can find a better professor	4
this was my second course in ml i took it with the aim of gaining a deeper insight into some of the fundamental topics and i was not disappointed the professor andrew ng teaches the concepts in a way that is easy to understand and reason about i loved the pace and the way the material is structured quizes and programming exercises completed the lectures very well to give a more complete picture of the topic at hand actually some of the quizes and specifically programming exercises are quite challenging this is actually a good thing as the lectures alone would make the course a bit boring and without any practical application examplesi wish the videos were a bit better in terms of video  audio quality so be prepared to ignore that aspect and just take the incredible knowledge that is given to youif programming exercises are too hard do struggle through them and use the forums to solve them it really helps you deepen the understanding of the concepts that are taught in the class	4
i think this was a  star course in  the course should have been updated to get  stars in 	3
great course learnt alot of extremely useful tools for managing software products	4
the teacher is not a communicator	2
worth spending  weeks to get the basic insights of the oil and gas industry and cost trends	3

awesome course 	4
great course will definitely continue learning python this summer	4
a great course  i loved the combination of theory and practice  the study cases really helped cement the understanding both professors were coherent  didactic and helpful in advancing my understanding of machine learning their quirky nerdy humor was endearing their knowledge noticeable and impressiveim definitely going to continue auditing the rest of the courses in the specialization im still trying to use graphlab as much as possible sframes are so similar to pandas dataframe that its not hard to do  however  plotting more complicated graphs than a scatter or line is still sometimes a challengei strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to explore and strengthen machine learning concepts in a vey applied manner congrats to the team at uw	3
really good introduction to the specialization quite basic but good for someone with absolutely no background in the topic	4
great course	4

the content of the course has been wellorganized and could be easily understood by a nonenglish speaker	4
it was excellent but i expected more feedback in the discussion forums	3
fair i liked the lectures though being nonnative english speaking i had to look some termanology as some of it was not explained futher than a brief staint of the right side of the page previous knowledge with matlab helped a lot as i figured out a lot of the workings but people starting from scratch might have more difficulties as i struggled quite a bit with the read and write i figure maybe it wouldnt be bad to have more throwbacks to previous stuff in the tests as to really make it connect some of it sits pretty loosely in the memorybut overall i was quite happy with the course i really liked the assignments  if anything consider putting in a assignments at the end that might be a bit bigger and incoorperates more different things from the various courses and let the coursegoer try out what they learned and maybe have some tools for help such that everyone walks away with the feeling of having written a program 	3
this is a great introductory course to project management the material is delivered very well and the material well chosen the only negative i have is that some of the lectures are quite long compared to other online courses i have done and i think would have benefited from some mini quizzes during the lectures to keep the student engaged and ensure that the material stuck in the past i have worked as a project manager on software projects and i wish i had taken this course before starting the job it would have helped a lot	3
very well designed course helpful to everyone aspiring to become entrepreneur	4
the course offers a basic outline of the project management without going into details	3
very good course thank you hkust	4
this is a very good course that teaches you many important skills in preparation for the next courses it does start off with the basics of sql ddl and dml that most professionals may already know but later modules that cover design concepts and practice are very good there are a few errors in the videos but these are easy to spot	3

after completing this course i could classify it as a musthave for those who must to perform management tasks or activitiesi would like to stand out the teaching quality knowledge and expertise of the instructor yael grushkacockayne just like all the people behind like the mentor in the discussion forum vijayakumar menon n its really remarkable their efforts to make easy all the matters dealt with clear examples and notesthe contents are very update and they give some very interesting references to other examples and tools which could very useful to check for more detailed informationit would be really interesting a second course about this subject a bit more detailed and focused on the project execution with the use of specialized tools for that goal jira redmine trac projectto conclude i recommend this course for those people who want to begin with project management activities or those who are working on these and they want to strengthen their skills and capabilities	4

i wanted to like this course but and perhaps its a mathematician thing the teacher just kept doing stuff without explaining why he is doing the stuff he is very animated and a good presenter but even when i understood what he was saying i couldnt get past the why is he doing this it is never selfevident for me	1
when i enrolled for this course i was really just looking for a definition for the word philosophy boy did i get more than what i bargained forinstead of going down the usual historical path and looking at the philosophers in just chronological order the lecturers at the university of edinburgh have divided the topic into broad strokes covering the big ideas and their related writers that have driven philosophical debate till today they made sure every topic linked up so we could understand materialism as the opposite of dualism rather than in isolation from other avenues of thought if i want to i could definitely take my studies in philosophy much further knowing now where to lookmy only minor gripe would be the strong focus on western philosophers and little mention of other cultural views however it would be unrealistic to ask for short online lectures to cover all of human thought endeavours hopefully other courses exist so all students can take a global approach to philosophy	4
great course for practicing totally recommend it	4
professor jim fowler is amazing great scientist with this sense of humor that inspires me to study math moremore more	4

its brief but it could help you for reviewing some concepts	3
i think that this course is really fundamental and it is necessary to learn best practices how to learn new material and how to broad our passion and other interest i think this it is amazing course but english is not my native language and for me it is a good idea to start this course again and to repeat it also i was not very active and didnt collaborate with other students so i think it is necessary also to fix this part i also very appreciated the tutors and enjoy their speeches	4
professor ng makes this extremely powerful tool of machine learning amazingly accessible i did this course in my midfifties  it wasnt easy to work through all those programming exercises performing the mental gymnastics necessary to visualize  manipulate matrices in your head but am now rewarded with not just a clear understanding of the capabilities of machine learning which is why i initially started this course but think i will actually be able to try it out on some simple problems	4
this course is practicalthe machine learning learners can get training how to implement a part of ai algorithms dealing programming exercisesharrison	3
very informative 	4
help basic learner to quickly learn python	4
hard to follow with a lot of technical intructions right off the bat with inadequate explanation a lot of read more about this at insert url videos were boring and the instructor was invisible just reading off the slides not very engaging	1
its a great course there is a lot of information and it might seem at times overwhelming but its organized nicely and prof lee has a very comfortable time explaining all the concepts a few more examples would have made this course easier but that does not mean it would have been better its as good as it gets	4

it was great to come through this course with itsmarvellous lections and interesting submissions strongly recommend it	4

i am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short tehchnically there is about h of videos for the  weeks of this course and no real documentations to reviewhence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion a full review of one or two games would have been a great addition	2
great course great professor great website	4
the course is well documented and interesting to learn the intricacies of several sanitation system and its relevant technologies with several case studies all around the world	4
image making is the focus of this courseif you love making images you will love thisnot much theory but all the more makingassignments needs a bit more time and thought than the other courses in the specialization	4

awesome course	4
great course	4
thought this more than useful in relation to plot and how conversation should move the story along	4
great course for beginners to get the basics of graphic design as well as for specialist to refresh these basics the great advantage of the course is practical assignments that are all connected so that in the end you will use material from previous assignments in your final one i would make all those optional assignments obligatory though great course	4
excellent modules excellent teaching excellent moderation and responsiveness from the tutor i was not expecting this quality really good	4
this is a great course the teacher is very clear and the material is very interesting the programming assignments are interesting the problems asked are very simple but the input is generally too large to use brute force you really have to implement the algorithms presented in the videos this makes you realize how much smart algorithms can make a differencethe level of the class is relatively high compared to other coursera courses ive taken if you want some serious training on algorithms look no further	4
awesome course good to go 	4
took a bit long before the course actually started but when it did it was a great course	3
very useful i start loving programming from this course the professor is professional and cute i have learnt a lot	4

i needed a solid introduction to double entry accounting this course helped me understand where plan articles had failed in the past	4
great people interviewing in the course	4
i have given this course  stars even though i think that there is room for improvement in the videos at times it feels like i am watching somebody reading slowly from an autocueteleprompter apart from this i would recommend this course to everyone i would even like to see coursera have it linked directly to their landing web page after all this site is all about learning and making sure that everybody is approaching the learning process as well prepared as possible is in everybodys best interest including coursera and those that create the course material	4
the course content is interesting and well laid out the lack of contact details for course queries is concerning as is purely being assessed by peers who may not follow the grading guidelines very well providing no feedback etc	2
helpful especially to get ideas about psycho therapy beside administering drugs	4
the best course in project development	4

basic introduction to data science	2
the fact that knowledgeable people have put together such a programme is a very high score secondly the rate and pace at which the videos and lecture notes have put together and presented is a high score the supplementary readers some of which can be downloaded and studied at oes own pace is very laudable the end of week test is well structured and no matter how you might have read and viewed the videos one still need some time to grasp everything the end of course examinations recieve very high score from me	4

relevant and well organized material when looking at it but in total it is way too thin more tips and tricks about xcode as a tool would have been nice some of the videos are pretty unrehearsed one of the lecturers hesitates and stutters a lotas for the final assignment being reviewed by only three persons is too few one of my reviewers had problems with his xcode environment and couldnt run my submission guess how he graded me the other reviewers had no problems luckilythere is almost no help to be found in the discussion forums which seems pretty buggy there are no tas and the staff doesnt seem to be very active eitherim sure the course will improve in the future its at the time of writing the only swiftxcodeios mooc on coursera	2

i completed this course while working abroad and i loved it the course helped be to have a better understanding and respect for different cultures in life and in the work environmentthank you	4
this was a well structured course even though it wasnt exactly clear that it was about educators in the first place the introductory videos on every week were very clever and on point loved the instructors and the whole team behind this course however the final assignments grading is unacceptable i cannot stress out how important it is to justify each score given especially the lower ones the final assignment did not have this and as a consequence when the final grade was in low or high you cannot know why and fix your mistakes in the future some people were kind enough to leave comments on the comment section below explaining everything however this should be the case for everyones review after all it is a paid course	3
the quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used the rest of course was excellent	3
great course and really good introduction to the python language	4
as good as it was up till now with introduction to meteorjs the course really starts to shine the education concept remains the same  during the lecture you receive a direction while the rest of learning is expected to be done independently by reading relevant resources on the webthe course still provides a working code and one can get away with boilerplated code but it defeats the purpose of learning the final assignment if done properly teaches lot and im extremely excited about how much i can do nowim also excited to work with a meteorjs framework which allegedly the hottest thing on the web right now really looking forward to start the next module	4
i have completed this course this course was awesome video lecture were very self explainable i could also discuss on discussion forums really impressed by this course i know this is one of six courses but the learning material was limited there should be more examplesthere should be some optional assignments and there should be more emphasis on the quizzes there was only one quiz in the whole coursei suggest there should be quizzes and coding examples for each module separately and and after each video there should be some lecture quiz the lecture quiz should have less percentage towards final gradesthere should be some passing grades like  or more for passingas i have completed this course without verified certificate there is no even unverified certificate for me edx is offering course performance certificate and honor code certificate for free users i will appreciate these steps to encourage people to follow the coursethanks for offering this coursegrateful to coursera and university team	4
very good course the professor have a fine sense of humour and the knowledge is easy to be absorbed with the homeworks my skill on programming is indeed enhanced	4

i wanted to get some basics of python but was rather disappointed by this course it is incredibly slow i really dont understand who might need a whole lecture to get the concept of functions or so probably this course could work for children with low level of math and zero programming experience but otherwise it is waste of your time i added the third star just for the book which is good on its own	2
the professor is amazing	3
i am not native in the language of the course but the way it was presented and practical exercises as a way of learning helped me a lot to go on absorbing the knowledge presented so far the course has been very simple very well explained and following it step by step what motivates me a lot to go on	4

best bang for the buck on coursera beauty in simplicity commendably concise if youre interested in mobile programming i suggest taking this course first to avoid becoming overwhelmed this may be the only class you need or you may take more from the schools offering longer and more expensive specializations either way take this class first	4
this mooc is so valuable i feel much more energized and motivated to pursue my dreams	4
very very good course i also did the data science specialization of jhu difference is that the level of this course is much higher than dsc but the explanation is so good that you understand everything thank andrew	4
great course thanks	4
very insightful although some of the assignments were a bit easy perhaps we could have a discussion of the rat park experiments and maybe even the possibility that some drugs can be used for recreational use	4
great course	3

great course the teachers are fantastic and the materia fascinating i have learned great concepts i will use in the future	4
excellent course i am not a gui developer but the course is setup in such an easy to learn and practice the course covers concept of language to coding then unit testing it starts with small code then is built up to larger project it also covers best practices for large project development highly recommended	4

the last assignment serves the core aim 	4
the lessons were very short but full of interesting and relevant information	4

its too long sentence to verification and we need to write it again	3
enjoying all of it actually in process of going through it a second time so much information is made available every week that i am finding and learning new things the second time through the variety of instructors and information sources is appreciated thank you for putting such a extensive course together and making it available for all	4
very interesting the scientific approach to cooking and eating	4
this course is way too basic so basic it doesnt even cover some of the essential basics like explaining what the box model is in css the only reason i gave  stars is because you can still learn something with it if you are a complete newbie but it is very far to be reliable if you are aiming to be a professional there is a long road to go after you finish this course which makes me think the certificate is almost pointless and worthlessit also uses things that are generally considered a bad practice like using dom event attributes in the html it is okay to present that to the students but you should also mention that while they are there it is usually not recommended to use them and explain what would be the recommended practicei have taken courses from other sites like codeschools codecademy and treehouse and left coursera for later because i believed that getting a certificate would require me to have some expertise but so far i feel kind of disappointed with the full stack packagei am hoping it will get better with the next modules	1
a bit easy but a good base motivating start	3
good information on unit and android testingalso provide some info on security issuescould do with more handson assignments and provide urls to android testing security and debuggingcode analysis tools may be expand to include overview of code analysis tools like lint	3

thanks a lot very convenient and useful management of the course	4
it is an interesting course but mostly for beginners	2
this is a great course	4
it was a fast and easy course i thought it could use more insight from other instructors the links to other videos were useful on the text documents that were available to read	2
the course is a very nice introduction to the whole specialization the structure of the course is very well developed contains quite a number of use cases that give illustrations to conflicts and possible resolutions the professors of the course invested quite some effort and time to it	3
this was good module it covers the basics of inferential statistical techniques along with its application using saspython i would definitely recommend to take up if you are a beginner	3
personally i strongly doubt that putting a bunch of slides and a few autograded exercises is the best way to learn about logic why then stanford university doesnt just email his students this material and let them work on their own instead of doing lecturesi dont see the added value at all apart from being able to discuss the topic in the forum with other online students whats the advantage in comparison to buying a book and doing the exercises therethis course to me started off with the wrong foot no info on the starting date of the course until the end of september when instead the course was supposed to start at the beginning of the month and now the complete absence of videos this to me seems more like a fuck up on the side of coursera which didnt find an agreement with stanford university so no material had been produced until now then in order not to completely ruin its reputation coursera put a bunch of slides calling it an online course and expecting people to buy this liei might be wrong and this could be only my theory and nothing else however i wont recommend coursera to anyone after this very bad feedback so far and the funny thing is that i had big expectations before the starthope this will be taken as constructive feedback and not as a complaint	0
nice teacher well regulated practice	4
we are getting basic ideas but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly with no examples  limited examples which is what will teach us the most then we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and its very difficult instead too much time spent on videos of role playing  just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them furthermore the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the timethe visuals are the best part of the course	1
this course is absolutely amazing i recommend this course to everyone	4
wrote in my commentthe course is extremely well presented and the difficulty level of the excercises is perfect	4
this was a fantastic course that help fill technical gaps in my knowledge of my camera and diiy studios there were days that were easy and then there were those that challenged me tremendously the math was always tough as a young student deciding on what university i would attend for my degree in design i had to choose a school that did not have math in my curriculum visual arts are my strength peters teaching style of descriptive definitions and instruction made this class something i look forward to everyday students in your real world peter are very lucky to have you as a mentor and a teacher those of us in your virtual world will just have to settle for the lectures that we have on our screen	4
it was a pleasure learning the course such vivid daily life examples to completely understand the topic the assignments are a joy to do as well	4
great course	4
exceptional the information is relevant the topics presented well and the additional reference articles interestingi suppose i should have taken the time to retake the tests to get  but who has timethank you	4
good start with fundamentals need to take more advanced courses to gain indepth knowledge	2

this was my first organized class post ba and i found it to be a great class that was well organized with a knowledgeable instructor and would recommend it to others i have dyslexia and add pi so these characteristics are important to me and i would be eager to take more classes from george thank you	4
this course is very helpful to really get a taste of the financial models used for investing if you are one of those who love to break down a problem and base your decisions on an in depth analysis then this is the course for you this course only talks about stocks and not other financial securities however the main advantage of this course is that you would learn concepts ideas and logics that could very well be extended to other financial securities the course is easy to understand but it is always a good idea to have basics of economics and mathematics brushed up beforehand	3
this course provided a smooth segway for an older student just learning r and getting back into school it was great preparation for the subsequent intermediatelevel r course thank you	4
i love this course firstly professors accent is so clear and i can understand  what he is talking additionally i like the short video per point  which keeps me concentrate within a few minutes it is a kind of very efficient instruction design last but not least the assignment design is great not too hard nor too much i can practice what i have learnt and what i need to know in doing these assignments in a word professor demonstrated fairly high teaching capability and left me a very good impression of hkust i would highly recommend this course to my friends who are interested in learning web technologies	4

it is a great course with lot of examplesthank you	4
professor garikipati provides a thorough explanation which is of immense help to a beginner in fem like me the course is very interesting the practice of making entire video in form of notes is very efficient for a student to grasp everything the teacher wants to convey	4
i really like the course i gain more knowledge and more confidence on programming	4
overall course quality is good and have a appropriate level of knowledge for new analysts i will recommend for who begins learning about data analyticneed improvesome of the subtitles are wrongexaminations need have more explanations they will be helpful when we choose the wrong answeri need to wait too long for reviewing someone in the end of course please consider this	3
amazing course teaches you right from basics prof ng explains everything in a manner which makes it easy to understand only one shortcoming i found in this course is not challenging enough programming exercises i understand that course has to cater a general and large crowd but adding maybe a few optional challenging exercises might help also if optional video content is provided for algorithms which have been taught in cs but are absent here it will be really useful	3
it was excellent	4
comprehensive and so enjoyable	4
good intro to responsive design although the homeworks could be harder	3
for an introduction course the syllabus is thorough and topics are well explained video lectures are well put together and engaging	3
a wonderful course delivered in a lucid and easy to understand format i like the discussions much thanks	3

addiction is not only about smoking and alcohol and drugs its way way beyond that and thanks to dr michael kuhar and the emory university for revealing it to me	4
nice course to start with i think this course is good for beginner	4
a very good course my only suggestions would be to extend the course for a week or even two the time and amount of work needed to complete the last weeks assignments were inconsistent with the other weeks to have done my best with the final quiz and assignment i should have spent a significant amount of time reviewing material from previous weeks	3
very clear and illustrative course about the industry	4
ive learned so much about the functional operations of a database and have already implemented changes in my daytoday work while my focus is on python for now i feel that some additional courses or information on best practices of database models and architecture even in this short class there are so many great note taking moments	4
i really like short courses which give you a lot i learnt many key although simple points from this course thank you	4
very boring presentation of the material	0
i am slowly making it through the lessons a very confident presenter makes it cool	4
good course to get the basic understanding of quantitative modeling	4
good theoretical and practial lessons	4
the way its being taught is simply excellent	4
good course to start learning rbut still missing some explanations in the lectures regarding programming assessments	3
good concise introduction for the topic	2
the content is easy to understand and the programming assignment helps to understand the materials well	4
this class is very easy it is a decent introduction but has very little content it is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world and takes the content very slowly the test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading rather than thinking critically it seems like they are just trying to make sure you watchedread the content and understood it rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge i guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big but the content could go a little faster	2
the instructor voice are so calm  so i cannot concentrate well	0
this is a very great introductory course to machine learning covers several models videos are very thorough and programming assignments are very helpful in grasping and implementing what is discussed in the lectures i highly recommend this to anyone interested in getting in the machine learning field	4
i am very grateful to you this introductory course it has helped me a lot im about to start a master of public health and the seen here will be a great support the topics were handled in a very practical way and explicit no doubt in finding new college courses to which they belong and considers much a doctorate greetings from acapulco mexico	4

excellent course  very helpful 	4
i really enjoyed this course the course instructor has a nice tonality and the presentation are most of the time well structured the database installation should be covered in more detail and i had to buy the book in order to understand everything over	3
great course and great teacher	4
this course is very well organized and exposes students to some fundamentals of machine learning and practical applications of them assignments and guidance to complete them from resources tutorials and test cases are absolutely helpful to learn these basics and their application with an hands on approach and gives students much more confidence on what he is learning and has been able to absorb there is a lot of complex materials covered in this class which at the beginning looked fairly insurmountable but working the assignments with help from resources in form of tutorials test cases to run and of course the very valuable forum discussions and moderator tom ms continuous help made learning a lot easier than i thought finally thanks to prof andrew ng for offering such an well organized course like machine learning through video lectures lecture notes pdf and exercise files to make learning more meaningful and much easier to absorb	4
the instruction was very well organized and is a great introductory course the video module explanations were easy to follow and the documents were good practice	4
good course indepth information about machine learning	4
great experience ive taken a few machine learning courses grad school level and this course explained concepts really well i feel like i solidified a lot of my understanding of machine learning onward	4
the lecture was very abstract and difficult i could pass the course somehow by writing the code presented in the lecture but i must say i understand less than the half of the course contentsresponding to question from the instructor i clarify the comments abovei found the whole lecture difficult this may be because the subject is not something i have even thought about it was difficult to understand the difference and importance of key concepts such as trie suffix class etc overall i learned that the tricks somehow work but my comprehension was not as deep as i can think about the extension or applications i guess more examples or providing intuition would help me to digest the material	2
very interesting and informative course	3
thank you	4
great cource but it would be better to get more practice	4
another great course offered by dr chuck	4
lectures are perfect for beginners although the use of linear algebra could have been emphasised much more because that is where the magic happens the support from mentors is exceptionally well you will get a reply within half an hour the learning exercises are meticulously curated the instructor andrew ng sir is brilliant the best course for a complete beginner on machine learning	4
its great for beginners but very easy for advanced programmers	3
awesome course for beginners in statistics as they clear examples for whatever they are teaching us i love coursera	4
the professor is really capable so interacting and hence making the course a wonderful one	4
i am sad to be coming to the end of this specialization i have learned so much and dont want it to end	4
nice introductory course	3
it is a good course but rather for real beginners on a basic level but everything is clear	3
unfortunatelly i did not get anything from this course the course was based on a few obvious tips you get from any selfhelp or management book	0

this is a highly recommended course and the content is second to no other on coursera at the time of this review i have taken all of the courses in the series from copenhagen business school as well as nearly all other business management courses offered for other institutions this specific course on strategic management is the single most informative and current material of all of the options it does not answer every question or address every concept you would need to know to run a major corporation but it is a fantastic overview of past and present methods of business strategy and is of value to any business minded individuali highly recommend this course and the entire series from cbs enjoy	4

death by power point if you can learn from essentially listening to a pod cast and reading unix type manual pages then this course is for you if youre like the rest of the population then these lecture videos are useless the only redeeming quality to this course has been the homework but you can find them online or come up with them on your own	0
the course is most useful for students not in the mathsengineering field as a medical student with only high school maths and computing i am happy to learn just enough to explore real problems in my field it does not assume previous knowledge in advanced linear algebra multivariable calculus and matlab programming im able to go through the whole course and finish the assignments in just  weeks in contrast i am unlikely to be able to go through the other online ml courses by famous universities or even the youtube version of prof andrew ng	4
great course easy to follow	4

i was really disappointed with this course i took the other courses from brian caffo and truly enjoyed them for the previous courses ive always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material there is a book for regression models but but its a real mess it feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look there is a bunch of wrong code and typos the explanation doesnt go as far as it should i had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course i hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others if they dont review it dont bother paying for it try learning regression models elsewhere	0
excellent course i learned so much	4
great introductory course exercises are relevant and dr andrew ng has done a great job in relating it to the industry practicesusage	4

although you cannot do the assignments unless you upgrade i learned so much prof allard was very clear and gave many great resources that i have used in other courses this class shaped my political opinions on fiscal issues and helped me to understand the implications of tax and welfare reform in terms of the general public this online course was definitely on par with and a great supplement to my ivyleague education i would highly recommend this to anyone who is studying social sciences	4
as its the start of the whole specialisation its not very clearly detailed like few lectures are amazing as solo lectures but overall week wise all lectures do not connect so well	3
great course really great i learned so much thank you andrew ng for creating it	4
equally excellent experiencewould request if you could please share slides of all the courses it will help for future reference	4
the material is very very goodi am not very confortable with the professor as a lecturer though he is very distractig at the end i opted for just reading the transcripts instead of watching the videosit is slightly annoying that the references are not properly quoted sometimes	3
the course content is good although it is very usa centered it is very good for people with small experience in the professional market no just the games area but all areascasey is a great teacher he makes boring stuff be less boringthe only negative point of the course are the assignments again like in the previous course the assignments are too subjective too personal hard to do and evaluateunlike last course game design i really recommend this one useful stuff	3
self pace course learned a lot	4
best course had on coursera ever	4
professors very hard to understand and videos dont have the best editingalso extremely math heavy lectures being just math formulas without a lot of real life applicability ex the assignments where you have to project a logo or cube when the program gives you the location corners in a file which will never happen when you use your camera finding that position is a prerequisite of the entire program	1
is a big challenge to keep the grader pleased i very much like this course it is my intent continue to develop programming skills in python	4
i dont know what i expected this course was quite pedestrian but it is an introductory course	3
love this course and dr chuck	4

a comprehensive overview of web programming good for a noob or as a review whose previous web programming experience may have been limited to the national supercomputing consortiums free now archived html manual the content of this specialization will get you up to speed quickly as with all coursera courses it is up to you to unfold the concentrated content on your own time this lecturer makes it easy to do so i highly recommend this course	4
this and the following courses are taught clearly and engagingly  a great intro to both progr	4
thankspaul kofman for good explanation	4
very nice teaching why dont you people try to make new tutorials for nodejs that would be awesomereally enjoying learning meteor	4
overall a good introduction to big data needed no prior experience but ironically i found id misunderstood the way mapreduce worked reading around afterwards i worked out exactly how it worked but i didnt think it was explained very well overall though a great intro into a subject which is highly hyped in the it industry and demystifies some of the concepts explaining what big data is good for and hinting at its limitations	3
great insight in how to develop the mind and the importance of learning	4
it very useful for me i can apply knowledge in my workplace	4
welldesigned comprehensive practical	4
it is a really good course ive got some problems with the task because it was a bit difficult for me as my native language is spanish but despite that it went all good	4

i used to always say that everyone in life no matter what their profession was should take at least one basic psychology course in their lives after taking this course i can now say that this course is another one on the list for everyone in life to take it should be a requirement i feel very fortunate to have stumbles upon it and im very happy that i took it and just by taking the course my life has already started to change because i am now aware of things to make myself happier that i was not aware of before so this course has shed a lot of light on life human beings and how to be happier last im very grateful to prof rajagopal raghunathan for coming up with the great idea of giving this course and wish him all the best with his new book thank you all	4

the instructor for this course is charles severance aka dr chuck  his narrationexplanation is excellent its simple lucid and tothepoint also you dont feel very formal taking this course sometimes dr chuck is humorous  it helpsa lot of work goes into making a coursera coursethis course can even be taught as the first programming language and python is my first programming language	4
prof is amazing	4
i took and finished andrew ng ml course before and i though i now i know something about ml after finishing this course i feel less confident and i can see how many things there are ahead to learn especially when it comes to relation between size of sets vs features  model  tuning parameters of model how much different prediction you can get with the same datai cant wait to next part because after andres ngs course i started mini project using classification	4
it is an amazing course and a good gate for machine learning	4
the best course taught by best professor and best university	4
thank you very much too	4
incredible	4
this has been a fun course the length of it is ideal its long enough to think ive learned something but short enough that im not bored or dreading it i definitely spent at least  hours a week on it i had to read most of the relevant text book sections the free online one to do the homework results may vary im not sure how intense this is compared to an actual college course my guess would be about half as intense but it would definitely prepare you to breeze right through such a course i took it out of genuine interest and i might use it in my current career	4
good course for undergraduates basic concepts presented in a smooth and easy to understand way	3
very good course well explained the professor makes it very easy to understand and gives very good material i liked the programming assignments best way to learn and apply the new skills following small steps	4

thank you very much for providing the access to this amazing course on social topic it helps a lot in enhancing the understanding of the definition of social and also provides multiple cool way to promote social skills what i appreciate even more is that there are a bunch of tool kits introduced in this course	4
great stuff	4
ive enjoyed this course greatly and look forward to delve further into philosophy i loved all of the talks by all the lecturers and found their followup videos to be particularly helpful unfortunately that also meant that there was no forum to access and discuss the questions posed by the lectures with other people taking the course which i believe would have helped to hone my argumentative skills which i believe is necessary to have and further develop and enhance when learning about philosophythank you very much for this amazing course if you could introduce more philosophy courses particularly ones that are more advanced and in depth that would be great	4
best course for basic learner	4
this course is perfect i learnt a lot of skills and knowledge through this course and the lectures are also wonderful i really appreciate for the all efforts of pwc and coursera team to make this brilliant course	4
very interestin insight on how we learn how brain works and techniques and tips to maximise longlife learning loved professor oakley explanations very recommended	4
very useful with easy to follow steps and advice	4
very well formulated with all the necessary details required to understand the basics	4
great course	4
excellent introductory course on machine learning focusing on simple linear and multiple regression lasso regression and kmeans clustering a background in python programming is useful but not required as the instructors discuss the techniques with annotated code examples	3
while the last module of this course is very interesting and kept with the specialization the first  modules are a waste of time for the most part why would i want to learn about att for two weeks the amount of useful concepts introduced in the first  modules wont take more than  minutes if unnecessary things were removed	2
wonderful course	4
i really enjoyed the course the instructors were both greatexcellent idea to involve commentary from finance and sport sector  it was very interestingi also really liked some of the links such as the office series all in all great	4
this was a very helpful primer in understanding nutrition	4
such a nicely sciencebased course on how to get the most out of life  thank you	4
some things are useful such as the table task list but i would say there isnt enough of this type of help it would be better if there were more tables like thatalso more information and help is needed on how to accomplish multitasking unfortunately multitasking is necessary in many environments from office to home and even a housewife has to multitask one of the most important aspects of multitasking that was not covered and that is really needed is how to multitask in a situation of housewife type of work examples of this include engineering molecular biology chemistry work in a lab in general etc you constantly need like a housewife put something for a chemical reaction or start laundry or put a cake in the oven and then you have to wait for the chemical reaction to occur and during that time when you wait you need to keep this ongoing laundry task in your head so that you dont forget to take it out later on time and when there are more than  tasks like that and they all have this pick me up and start on me later thing they are all in your head and they take up all your memory and resources and the worst part is its difficult to schedule them because you need to schedule not how long will something take not in a linear fashion but how long will multiple parallel things take i would really appreciate it if there was something about this topic in a time management course	1
really useful information and enjoyable lectures	4
i really like this course	4
quite informative all videos are short enough to keep you focused key ideas are helpful and practical	3
would have bee nice if it included a bit more in git tutorials but that is easily figured out when left to ones own devices	3

the professor is cute	3

good professor good exercises to review what youve learnedmy only complaint  if considered that  is that r was difficult for me to learn and work with especially when ill be using spss for my own statistical needs moving forward id like for there to be an option within the course to use spss instead of r	3
very interesting and compelling course and i liked the questions every few minutes during the lectures as that helps me to retain informationmy only complaint is that the lecturers manner of speaking is very rhythmic and repetitive and that makes it kind of hard to lose track of his words	3
great introduction to data structures in python never going to forget them now	4
the course was educative and highly engaging the short video clips with the quiz questions at the end of each module helped me to further understand the topic of discussionfurthermore the submission at the end of the course and review of colleagues work added to my better understanding of the course as i was able to share in the understanding of my other coursematesi hope moma will come up with independent courses that will treat each of the six modules as a separate course	4
an amazing course integrating all the relevant concepts of psychology and letting viewers understand from the scratch moreover adding interviews and discussions with veterans to the course have made it exceptionally good	3
i learned quite a lot from this course the videos were brief but the material was wellexplained for a solid general overview of financial statements and the logic behind them i highly recommend this course	4
 this course is a blueprint for budding doctors in their quest for their elixir of lifethe best  for me seminal part of the course was distinction between different field of informatics with examples hitherto everyone seems to be confused with public health informatics population health informatics population health management this course has glued the different pieces into a perfectly fitting jigsaw puzzlethe best informatics related course i have seen encompassing the whole breadth of healthcare transformation through health it	4

its a great course for unexperienced cooks most of the recipies are very basic but i think they encourage people to cook even if theyre not used to cooking a lot the explanations are very clear and easy to follow personally i would have loved to hear more about preparing and storing homemade food freezing storing in jars etc	3
simple explanations that make the topic rather easy to learn and having a visual aid the drawings i find it to be so much more friendly that ive really come to enjoy what im learning im mostly a visual learner so to me this is very good so far it has been a great course with r labs that can help reinforce the ideas and give a bit more practice in the subject i do recommend the course	4
never thought it was gonna be such a complete class simple but very important things to know	4

there were several technical issues no submission button for peerreviewed assignment right answers listed as wrong and vice versa in the clips etc the lecturer also sounded a bit unnatural with pauses in sentences where you wouldnt expect them making it harder to process information the course material itself wasnt bad but the execution just seemed a little unfinished	1
very interesting thumbs up	4
great practical course 	4
interesting subject and wellproduced videosthe assignments are however arbitrary and illdefined leading to wildly different peer reviews and many who have completed the assignments correctly to be stuck in a grading limbowould not recommend at this point	2

in this fine introduction to computer programming i covered a lot of ground the course lays out an elegantly constructed approach to the fundamentals of coding with python  the videos and materials were filled with elucidating code examples and sensible development practices all meticulously explained ive never found a more approachable guide to building welldocumented functions or a more useful explanation of how relationships between variables and values are managed during program execution the quizzes challenged my preparedness to apply a solid understanding of the subject matter i applaud presenters paul gries and jennifer campbell for the topnotch way they crafted this excellent introductory course	4
this course will go through all the definitions and the core concepts of big datait is a great introductory coursethank you so much	4

my very first course on coursera quite usefu	4
this course is very interesting and usefulreally enjoyed it	4
very clear and interesting	4
material is very detailed which is both a positive and negative it gets a little redundant and some things are just common sense you can tell the instructor is trying to be upbeat but is very clearly reading off of cue cards so its a little flat for a free course you get a lot of information and it is very easy to get a  on every quiz	2
its a good course in financial accounting foundations and i real liked the idea of the peer assignment	3
though it was mentioned that this course is for beginners without too much of statistics background i still feel some decent background is required to take up this course particularly the inference partotherwise the course is pretty good and commendable	3
a good introductory course for absolute beginners students having prior programming experience in any other language will find the contents to be too basic the syntax will be the only new thing that experienced programmers will get to learn from this course	4
very clear exdplanation of quadrotor dynamics and kinematics	4
very comprehensive and handson course for machine learning	4

amazing course taught by the mystro himself 	4

good course focusing on best practice and semantics	4
discussions in this course are voiceless and dead and the instructor never appears in discussions i couldnt understand anything from video lectures cannot understand enunciation not enough detailed lack of examples related to the assignments so the only source was repository httpkasperdanielhansengithubiogenbioconductor with html files and a lot of searching through bioconductor forumsi liked the relevance of quiz questions to real life genomic questions but all quiz questions were outstandingly difficult because of both lack of examples in lectures and errors in some packages inside bioconductoroverall i expected much more from this course and i cannot recommend it to anyone	1

extremely well thought out course highly recommended could be improved by giving more involved examples and refining the course on backpropagation which have some typos and brought about a little awkwardly but still a great course	4
this course presentation is simple and easy to digest with some hints about where the complexity exist the exercises also well designed to lead student to the right direction without worrying too much about implementation detail that support the main topics i usually focus in the wrong direction while learning something new this trap is frustrating but this course is really enjoyablethank you for making this course	4

i wish that the classifications of the major cancer groups were more descriptive concerning the treatment for different types of lung cancer for example nothing is mentioned about childhood cancers or the area of lymphomas i realize that this is an overview of cancer but cancer cell biology and current treatment practices based on immunologic findings were not given the coverage they deserve	2
very informational and interesting	3
hi louthanks for the course i have really enjoyed it and looking forward to season  my suggestion how to make the course even better  please provide correct answers with explanations to quizzesthanks again and greetings from the czech republic	4
it tries to cover a lot of ground lack of some practical tasks	1
its not difficult maybe im major in history so i find this course very interesting	4
the topics are all very basic and the audiovideo is subpar but the course offers a coherent overview of the core topics of time management and several useful tools and resources together with a few pointers to relevant literature on the topic such as david allens gtdapplying all of the techniques presented in the course is a surefire way to enhance ones own productivity both at work and in the private life	2
great	4
while the course does a good job of explaining most things but if you struggle with a problem or a topic support is nearly non existent and offline resources for julia are limited no one used the discussion forums either unfortunately	2
this course was great it is obvious that it was carefully planned and laid out the visiting scholars were a great opportunity to not only learn about historical fiction and what kind of research is done its also was a great way to learn the process of writing the necessary text that ought to have been taught was given carefully without suffocating the student it was fun and knowledgeable class i would recommend this class highly to anyone who is really interested in literature and fiction	4
gave me a good introduction to basic git and github operations	3
well balanced approach that invites multiple perspectives on ultruism i would have liked to see the objections against ultruism of ayn rand being addressed in the course but i suppose it is difficult to give a course that addresses all aspects of a given topic but ayn rand had a definite contradictory viewpoint and it would have enhanced the class tremendously if it had been considered	3
since this is my very first online course i dont have too much to compare it to but i thought the lectures and the quizzes  programming problems were very focused especially the coding where a lot of the grunt work was done for you allowing you to focus on the actual machine learning algorithm which was helpful in grasping the application of these complicated concepts i especially liked the later part of the course where emphasis was made on understanding how to make educated decisions about where to spend time enhancing the performance of the ml code  training set this will save the potential ml student hours and hours of work thanks to the professor producer and moderators	4
excellent course submitting assignment is little tricky	4

dr moerman is passionate about qualitative research and does use some interesting examples to illustrate his ideas some of which are drawn from his own research experiences do note that if you were to take this course you need time because the assignments are time consuming and the videos are i think a little longer than they really need to be also some of the assignments are designed in a pretty strange way eg one weeks assignment requires a shocking  peer reviews to pass but when i took the course there were only a few submissions this probably means i cant get my cert until the next session starts  if im lucky	1
this course helped me a lot to better understand the financial markets  and the different assets in which we can invest the presentation was simple and clear in most of the modules maybe more examples and detailed description needed in company evaluation especially for students with moderate mathematical background the module of bonds needs in my opinion  reconstruction so that we can read and understand the changes in bonds prices we find in the economical websites and newspapers anyway the course is motivating to know more  extend our knowledge thanks a lot to all the professors and lecturers who prepared that course special thanks to dr michelle and dr ines for their attractive and simple approach i recommend this course to all interested in investment management either for themselves or for professional purposes	3

the professor is extremely passionate and wellinformed about the subject however it would have been a lot better if he used a more visual approach to explaining things including graphs and diagramsthe positives about the course are theres plenty of proofs for those who are so inclined so you really get to understand whats leading up to a particular formula the professor shows some very interesting applications such as showing why  and pi are not the same and constructing a bridge with only one side harmonic tower which is a real eye opener he shows you that the concepts in calculus are all deeply connected there is not a single piece of the puzzle that does not fit with the other pieces getting this realization is probably one of the key value propositions of this course the mentors in the forums are extremely helpful and respond quickly to your queries you learn a lot about using formal mathematical symbols the questions are incredibly hard and very little in way of practice examples are provided this forces you to up your game and really try to understand how things work things that are learned with a lot of hard effort are retained much better than things learned without much effort hence i highly recommend this course and am grateful that i took itif you are the kind of person who likes everything to be served cut and cleaned on a silver platter you are not likely to enjoy this course however if you enjoy solving puzzles with often missing incomplete or poorly presented information then this course is exhilaratingthe course can be improved by adding more concrete example with real numbers to show how some of the theorems work adding more graphs to show how the functions look adding more practice problems with clear explanations in case you get it wrong ensuring that exercises are in sync with the sections being presented for example in the middle of the course were asked a question which involves the taylor series which is not presented till the last week adding more worked out examples with detailed explanations avoiding using confusing variable names like little m and big mi learned a lot in this coursethe best lesson was when professor jim fowler says that the point of mathematics is not truth but proof not whether something is true but why	3
basic but quite useful i really enjoyed it my favorite coursera course so far	4

i liked the couse a lot but i think the quizzes are very tricky and there are questions that you have to deduce more than to know this is ok as part of learning but it turns a little difficult when english is not your first language also there were some errors in the quizzes especially in week  and  its very interesting to listen to the informants but i find difficult to answer the questions about them im not familiar with those languages and its very hard and i think thats not the point of the course like to know how to say grandma in abruzzese or how many ways there are to say son in chinese so it may be taken into consideration anyways i really liked the course and i hope it can grow for the best thank you	3
a great course based on their book i read the book  but found that watching the videos created deeper learning i procrastinate less now thank you to dr oakley i will get into med school because of you	4

review commentswhat i learn most form this course is parallel structure and sentence variety lessons in week parallel structureit uses some conjunctions like and but bothand not onlybut alsosentence varietyuse the different  types english sentence style simple compound complex and compoundcomplex to enrich your writing in addition adverbs prepositional phrases like in the morning other transitions furthermore could be used to create variety at last combining the short sentences medium sentences  words and long ones  words will also make your writing alive some other tips will also help like repeating key nouns using synonyms saying things in different ways use different sentence types start sentence differently use different sentence lengths use synonyms effectivelyconsidering sentence variety will be the last step when you revise your essay so do not do it in the begining	2

well put course intriguing educational and interestingdefinitely learned about learningthank you	4
great course and very helpful the following details prevent me from giving it a  stars review the explanation of the tools to use during the course is very messy it may discourage people that are less used to work their way around searching working tools the audio of the videos sometimes loses a lot of quality for me it seemed like all the assignments were on spot with the balance between theory and standalone thinking however i really noticed the jump of time invested for the last assignment i think the course would highly benefit from having an assignment on week  instead of having that pause in betweenanyway the course was greatly structured and interesting cant wait to go on with the whole specialization	3

very basic in terms of material covered would be nice as a free remedial class in prep for the main specialization homework assignments were confusing and did not appear to have been reviewed by the instructors before being sent to students main problem the free software students use was not the same version as that being used to develop the homework instructor support was not evident in the user forums below the quality of the free classes taken in the past	0

i find this to be a very nice and stimulating course the teachers are enthusiastic and entertaining the course material slides quizzes captions needs to be polished but the general organization of the course is logical clear and systematic the course presents an experimentalists view of the subject which i find very good considering that much related coursera material is quite theoretical there are plenty of historical notes and introductions of general neurobiology research viewpoints dont miss the excellent bonus material interviews in particular i enjoyed the cherry picking metaphor some students have had problems with the instructors accent but perhaps because english is not my first language this has not been a problem for me at all im looking forward to part two of the course	3

i felt the initial splash screen was a bit time consuming also lot of the knowledge felt like more bookish could have been different styles of management and approaches or even how leaders in the past like dale carneige would have approached this course has a lot of potential and i feel revising the next version would make it so much better for novice program managers	1

im honestly quite pissed the material itself is fine but i have had a terrible experience working with the instructors i dont think i will continue taking these coursesi dont appreciate the amount of time and effort given into the programming assignments only to receive practically zero help first of all i dont know why im failing the test cases i just am your program runs through maybe  tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructors decide you should only see the first  but then i try posting on the forums to receive help only to have it removed quite frankly i have spent well over  hours at this point on a single problem and ive created my own tests and i have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forums and i still have no clue what to do i have school a job and yet im losing all this productivity because im running all these damn tests hoping on the offchance that i catch whatever weird bug it is thats failing my code all i want is real concrete feedback	0
excellent course for those people that start in the art of writing	3
sometimes lectures go too fast could dive more into css and javascript	3
its nice course to begin with content	3

feels like this course in the specialization was a bit rushed compared to the first  courses it had  modules first  last that were more like placeholders and the middle  modules went from concept to the maths behind the algorithm very quickly it needs a bit of work on expanding the course and presenting a bit more slowly having said all that the concepts and algorithms taught are very interesting and a good first step into the unsupervised learning section	2
amazing course it push you to go through the right design process making it fun and useful	4

the course was extremely easy i hoped it would be more of a challenge no homework only a  questions test every week that is also extremely easy as someone whos always been interested in ancient egypt i already knew some things and ended up being able to pass the tests with  without even following the course its really an introduction for people who are pretty much new to the subject so id recommend it but for people who are looking for something more you might find it boring even though the teacher is nice the description of the course made me hope that it would be more interesting visually i mostly read the transcriptions instead of watching the videos because the teacher would just stand there and talk without moving and it was not stimulating to me	2

several comments in general the course is well conductedit is not easy to follow but this is natural as it a very abstract subject the exercise sets peerreviewed where very instructive but i think that the quizzes where a little too easy in comparison i missed a little a more intuitive view a broader view of the subject as well as a review of more advanced applications and developments such as infinite galois groups etc	3
overall this is a very effective introduction to angularjs angularjs can be intimidating or confusing and this course is largely an introduction but the videos and exercises do a great job of letting you get over the initial learning curve this course will give you a thorough foundation in angularjs way better than any other free course online and will give you an idea of where you can go off and explore on your own if youre interested in going on to develop intermediate skillsmy only critique of this course is that i really had to explore the additional materials at the end of each section to get a grasp of some of the concepts i found that some of the videos oversimplified pretty complicated subjects and werent thorough enough to allow you to complete some of the exercises i also think the course briefly introduces some pretty complicated tools too early to new developers and doesnt do a good job of explaining their value like grunt and gulphowever this course is still amazing for a free course if youve done any of the quick tutorials in angularjs like codeacademys youve really only scratched the surface of angularjs a handson course like this give you a much better foundation to conclude despite its minor flaws this is still the best free introduction to angularjs online today good luck	3

compared to the course  statistic inference this session seems to be a little be informal and rush but still learn a lot from the conception of linear regression	3
the course is good but is not focused on scala features it is more generic parallel programming approach	3
positive very interesting and informative lectures and subject matternegative fellow students who have no knowledge of the subject other than what they themselves are learning are required to submit case studies for peer review by other students who have no more knowledge of the subject than they do these case studies are heavily weighted and if the person is reviewed negatively for whatever reason they must resubmit it never knowing why they were given low scores or what the correct answer should have been no instructor assistance is given huge turnoff for me and many of my fellow students i want to withdraw drop this class and take another with more clearly drawn parameters	0

i am interested in taking the regression models course and took this one as a refreshment for the statistics knowledge i already had i found the course well done and the resources easy to use and throughoutas a negative point i would mention that as the topics get more involved the time dedicated to each one seems to decrease to the point where both multiple testing and group comparisons are pretty much a briefing which kind of defeates the purpose of including them on the course in the first placei give the course a  out of 	3

i think it would be better if the lectures can go a little bit deeper on the topics in this course	3
great subject and some very well presented videos however there were several which were incomprehensible either because of the quality of the video or the very heavy accent of the speaker especially to a nonamerican viewer one doesnt always want to read a transcript but to listen and concentrate if all the videos had been of good listenable quality i would have given the course  stars	2
in my opinion that this course can help any one that want to know about the financing and diversification 	3

really poor approach to grade this course regardless of the effort put in on assignments peer reviews are inconsistent unguided and poor as a result bringing down the final grade one is likely to obtain on a course there is also a limited course support from the staff and no feedback in general for any of the issues raise personally i would not recommend	0
absolutely great course i like the system of work the submissions the wideos and the information it helped me to understand all much better	4
great material not too in depth but if you know some programming then you will at least be able to properly read code now and know what to google which i think is the most important for learning a new programming language	4

dr charles severance is an awesome teacher his teaching style and the way this course is designed makes it just awesome and easy to learn	4
the new platform is very versatile and easy to navigate the page layout is much more clear it is easy to navigate from course material to discussion boardsi like the quiz format including expanding the number of choices for the multiple choice selections but the grading was confusing for quiz  some questions came back with multiple well done comments even when i had not selected the answer for which i was being praised i also was told i made errors on the same question and this was after i answered the question question  on r generic functions the exact same as i had answered it when i took the course earlier this yeari was not a fan of not having to take a picture to submit work so i am pleased that is no longer a requirement i hope the typing pattern match is sufficient to affirm identityi have one comment on content specific to this class week  content lacks relevancy to the project and data products in general i agree that knowledge of r packages classes and methods is an important part of understanding r i am not sure where that fits in the data science curriculum as a whole though maybe expanding the curriculum to include a second more advanced r class with a project to write our own methods build an r package or do something with yhat that would assign relevant work to reinforce the lecturesi would be happy to do further beta testingdcp	4
excellent introduction to sas no matter what your field of research videos are clear and easy to follow looking forward to doing the next course	4

trully a great course i wish ive competed it many years earlier	4
def a useful skills to have when starting to interview for jobs this is a hard course to teach to begin with i found the lectures really boring too long hard to understand and just not really motivated well i think the homework problem are good but they are very time consuming you need to use various methods to find edges cases and though that might be a good skill to have as well its just too much to get done in one week and somewhat frustrating when youre only stuck in one test case i think this could be an excellent course with a few modification on the slides and adding more motivations and making shorter homework problems that focuses on the main part of the material for that as oppose to things weve already covered in the previous week at the moment i dont think ill continue this specialization the way its designed	0
good course	4
the speed is fit to me	4

this course gives great insights into the internals of machine learning i recommend this course to any one who wants to secure a future in machine learning andrew ng is a great instructor and the quizes and assignments are thought provoking learning a tool such as r can help you do the stuff but knowing the internals can help you do the stuff better	4
very good experience thanks	4
i learned a lot from this course  its fun and it has very good exercises	4
excellent course challenged preconceptions and reminded me about my own responsibilitiesin learning	4
in this capstone project youre given a framework to work with and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria the problem is theres very little instructions or support so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said do whatever you want and walks out of the door overall the specialization feels illorganized and of questionable quality and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums	0

i just love this topic it is really fun and teaches you a lot	4

interesting and interactive	3
need to improve the clarity of the lectures but its a good course though	4
this is really useful for me thanks a lot 	4
some good content however text has numerous spelling mistakes and there is no involvement by academic staff nor can one see ones answers to quizzes once done nor standard answers provided as with so many coursera moocs little involvement by fellow students in discussion fora no certificate on completion which is a pity because the cost of a purchased one is somewhat prohibitive for third world students with our exchange rates	1
this is very educating and its so easy to know as it is detailed for beginners	4
there were some great lectures included in this course but the emphasis on the content we were not receiving was a bit disheartening i would have loved to view more of the controversial lectures that were referenced in the wrapup	2
awesome course thanks for everything it would however be great if you also could provide the chinese characters for all the stuff weve learned while we learn it and not in the end of the course  bestvinicius	3

i am glad this was my first financetype course ive learned much more than i expected from an introductory course and found this course very wellrounded there were ethical discussions interwoven into the technical content along with corresponding human tendencies in regard to ethical dilemmas the broad selection of guest speakers gave true insight to what happens out there in the real world and i learned a lot of from their shared stories i now believe that if i had a doover for college majors i would have doubled into finance plus tried to have gone to yale 	4

topline introduction	1
the course is amazing and is a must recommend to the ones who are just starting out learning python this course would successfully launch your from knowledge zero to a stage from which you can understand the later complexities that are involved in developing complex applications using python	4
great course	4
two teachers in this course are very nice and careful thank you for you lead me to the new world	4
while the subject matter was extremely relevant i didnt think this course was taught well much of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching i felt as though i was just copying and pasting sample code at times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new modules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used in most cases i could have learned the ionic modules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code which is often what this course felt like id have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new modules without any contextthe quizzes are not challenging the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice and the exercises just provide cutpaste code snippets without any reasoning or explanation i would have preferred to have the exercises conducted by providing a high level goal and then a solution to check against rather than the put this code here approach thats used the assignment grading is either far too obvious whether a required module was injected or not or completely arbitrary generally the assignments lacked nuance and complexity as well i didnt feel like i really learned any of the concepts behind this material after going through the course	1
good teacher i learnt the basis and its pretty cool but id like a bit more of responsive design in here	3
it was sometimes repetitive as i knew quite a bit of the course im a student in electrical engineering but its an excellent course for someone with no previous knowledge of telecoms and satellite	3
the instructor moves very slowly both speaking and covering topics points get belabored i usually watched the lectures at x speed but i also have some basic tableau experience	1
excellent course well presented and easy to understand and follow very recommended as introduction into pm	4
presentations were presented well and the assignments were interestingly varied but quite challenging for the newbie	3
it was a good experience for me and i learn lot of new things	4

amazing course	4
great course a good introduction to the subjecteasy to understand	4
it was very helpful for me	4
in as much as i enjoyed the course at times the dialect was difficult however the reason for  stars as opposed to  stars is due to a lack of ability to have receive an answer to a difficult question answered by an instructor as opposed to another class participant who necessarily did not have any better grasp of the question than myself given that i certainly enjoyed the course overall	3
very interesting and challenging though the mentors were very quick to respond to queries thank you	3
awesome course almost all the important areas are covered and we can move to any direction further easily after completing this course	4
this course is great it taught me how to install and start using rstudio and github for data science	4
very nice brief introduction into the field gives good overview of main concepts  statements of problems in machine learning  approaches to finding solutions  methods to evaluate resulting solution  systematic material presentation with good examples and analogies	4
very helpful	4
it is a really professional and enrich course  materials are very helpful and assignments really help me to improve and check my understanding	4
this is an extremely interesting and informative course for me it was really fascinating six weeks of educational process i am very appreciated to the professor marc van oostendorp and his students for this mooc	4
amazing course i got more out of this than  years of school	3
vastly concerned with the esoteric minutia ideas and meanings assigned by others regarding photographs which most often arent even closely aligned with the original artists intentionsa brief few mentions of how photography has changed over time with advances in technology and development of new techniques was mildly interesting otherwise this course was predominantly meaningless this course will most likely be of no benefit to people not viewing or creating fine art photography	1
this is the second time i take this course i have already got a certificate of this course in  but still i love everything taught in this course andrew rules	4
well course teaches basics of python but you should always refer to python documentation in order to understand the concepts correctly to the course staff please update the slides where python is used to python	2
easy to keep up with the course valuable experience	4
interesting topic excellent teaching material	4
simply and easy to follow i love how the instructor delivers the lectures great course	4
quite useless i didnt feel that i learned anything at all assingments seem to be dessinged by someone very lazy the limitations of the assingments do not allow the students to practice what its been tought but it is asked in the peer assingment from the students to evaluate it i understand that when calling it introduction it is supposed to be aimed for people totally starting from  but still i cant see how this course is of any use it is short and does not cover anything i am very surpirsed that getting the certificate for this course costs the same in  than getting the certificate of the introduction to principles of game design principles of game design has more than double hours of classes and in the assingments you actually create a game and practice new stuff this course was very dissappointing	0
great course excellent professor	4
this course  english for career development helped me learn various important topics about how to be successful in career it helped me know my strengths and weaknesses how can i write a proper resume and cover letter  and i also learned how to face an interview this course was very useful and the knowledge it gave me is really helpful	4

very useful to understand the framework from scratch	4
learned a bit but overall it is literally not worth the price of admission i think that this course could be offered for free and maybe the others are worth paying for hope that the rest of the specialization is worthwhile	2

best course i ever took	4

thanks sir you are very good this course is very important and necessary for young people as me	4
this is one of the better courses on cousera the instructors are passionate the material is challenging but well explored and it is one of the most practical courses on logic as it talks about how to form and interpret practical argumentsthe only real downside is lack of interaction from mentorstas in the forum	3
thank you very much for your giving me this online course	4
coding assignments help shed the resistance 	4
very informative and rewarding professor is very energetic and shows he is totally involved in the course the major problem with this course is that as complex as it is coupled with the lack of access to the instructors to ask questions perhaps the assistants could be more responsive and helpful with problems students are having problems with it makes no sense to learn without knowing where one is making mistakes and how to correct them	2
very good introduction	4
in my opinion the course is well designed i generate a rough idea about the basic concepts of machine learning through it these concepts are important but made easy to understand	4
there is a disconnect between what is taught and what is assigned	1
if you love geography and data science please take it and start	4
overall a good an edifying course i feel as though i learned a number of things about pharma and the medical device industry through taking it the only thing that detracts from my rating is the clarity of the lectures bryana mayers lectures were a bit dense and confusing particularly the first few and she often read directly from the slides for some of the lectures it was not clear as to why that particular information was being covered despite this i was able to gather useful information it just wasnt always completely clear or easy	3
best course i have ever followed presented very interactively with a lot of useful information	4
professor hess is an enthusiastic and informative lecturer recommended course	4

it was a great coursegreat insights in how this stuff worksthank you 	4
i enjoyed the course the last project was a surprise because it seemed more difficult but then i realized all the components were in the lectures so dont think because it seems easy it actually is im very proud of my final project	4
great course so much useful information	4
well organized content excellent instructors easy and fun	4
pretty good basic overview of html css and javascript	3
i think this is an overview course about machine learning	3
main issues i encountered in the course many videos end with a suggestion to refer to the suggested materials for more information which are these materials and where can they be found the slides could use some diagrams here and there as the constant text screens are monotonous and make understanding harder in some cases the course does not settle on a balance between breadth and depth of information some aspects are presented at a very high level yet using very specialised terminology and concepts for instance context switching when describing the disadvantages of microkernels or preemptively scheduled systems  i have a cs background and had no problem with these aspects but i am aware i am highly subjective its a case of chicken and egg where if you understand the low level concepts you probably dont need the course and if you dont understand them you also cant understand the high level concepts at the end of the week  videos describing the three oss it is said in order to know the details on how to write a program and run applications in riotcontikitinyos please come back to our lectures who have more detailed videoswhich lectures are these and where can they be found the only practical exercises in the course week  are only vaguely related to the courses targetsall this being said it is an ok introduction to the embedded os world if you bring your own cs and os background knowledge	1
it helps thanks	4
excellent approach and content	4
while the content is very helpful and gary does his best to make people confident to improvise in jazz music this course has imho two major flawsthe biggest one assignments given and results accepted do not fit together eg in week  learners are supposed to describe in their own words how a piece of music does sound like but the accepted answers are totally different from such a description instead only a very detailed and specialized answer is accepted this leads to studends copying these answers into their assignments without them learning anythingthe other flaw is that gary is very brief in his explanations even intermediate musicians seem to struggle with content just because some explanations are not exact or vague	0
i found this very useful as i am transitioning from banking to private equity	4
i love the professors explanations through applications	4
the course itself was fantastic i had read dr hares book previously and was a part of the beta test of dognition but this was even better it helped me gain an even better understanding of the subject i can only highly recommend it to anybody interested in dogs and their behavior	4

this course inspire me a lot it is not easy but with tons of fun i spent a long time to think out the idea and make it and improve it i did progress in gaming making as a fresh man thank you	4
this course has provided a great introduction to gis it was easy to follow the lectures and the assignments were really fun in this course although being on the introduction level we have been provided with good explanations of how gis works and why we for instance press a certain button and not another the course has given me a better understanding of different gis functions but also the abilty to think more independently about the logic behind these functions im looking forward the next course	4

loved the deep thought processes this course explored planning through to implementation of complex strategies in real life scenarios adding value to any operations minded professional	4
this is a reasonably thorough introduction to the principals of functional programming in scala but to fully grasp the material presented i found it necessary to include supplemental material such as the functional programming in scala book by paul chiusano forward by the course instructor funnily enough one point of frustration however was the near total unavailability of the course tas or instructor also because the only forum for interacting with them is entirely public its impossible to receive any formal code review apart from the automated tests they run when you submit there were multiple occasions where i wanted feedback on not just the technical correctness of my solution but also to know if there might have been a more idiomatic or generally efficient read tailrecursive way to express some peculiar bit of logic	2
this is a great course very insightful and delves deeply into different levels of who is included in the talent pipeline a great expanded view the only thing i would change is the filming of youtube videos 	3
great lectures the course project could benefit from greater structure	3

great course i enjoyed the course very much learned a lot about writing proofs	4
overall i love the course the only problem was the grading process  since my classmates get to give me points there are many opinions but if you are unlucky and one of them decides to deduct a lot of your points  youll have to wait until the next session ends so other classmates my grade you againin general im happy about the course and yes i learned 	4
fantastic course for people who want to know the details to do great analysis and reports	4
mr severence is great teacher very interesting to study this course	4
there is a lack of supervision by the instructor some questions are too simple and basic and dont really prompt much of any reflection upon the course material presented i feel like participation in the forum posts was also weak all in all it was a good class for basic financial knowledge eg financial terms different investment vehicles etc	2
so cool and intersting	4
very educative and the knowledge is key to running a business	4
great course ive learned a lot all lessons were understandable professor was excellent and most important it was interesting and motivating thanks to coursera and prof nick santos	4

very easy to follow	4
highly recommended introductory course for anyone getting into experimentation i found the starting point appropriate for total novices though for someone with some background the pacing felt very slow and repetitive at times but there was a welldefined progression from the simplest to more advanced conceptsi would have appreciated some more theoretical content both foundational and advanced and the pacingstructure could use some rethinking to avoid staleness but overall this is a very nice introduction to important aspects of design of experiments and optimization	3
it was ok not that great because the practicallab exercise should have been more indepth	3
logical content and sweet voice	4
i fully recommend the power of microeconomics it is a clear welldesigned and practicaloriented course to understand the foundations of everydays economy the only observation is that i would pay more attention to contextualize and explore what entails adopting perfect competition as the ideal market structure and by the same token what truly means understanding economics as a science that addresses solely descriptive and not normative questions	4
best course to start coding with r and learn r	4
an excellent course indeed strongly recommended for everyone	3

ive been working on the internet since before there was a www so i didnt necessarily expect to learn much but in fact this was highly informative the history part was mostly familiar but it was helpful to have everything laid out clearly on a timeline the technology and security portions did a great deal to clarify my previously vague understandings of how things workand i especially liked the graduation ceremony at the end this is the first mooc ive taken that included a graduation and it was a nice touch	4
this was an amazing adventure i was really pleased to be part of big history id recommend everyone whos interested in history to check this course out	4
the best classes i have ever had i enjoyed every single lessons in the class the assignments and grading other students assignments were fun the last assignment is quite challenging but it is worth learning at the end of the class i feel like i am a real developer and ready for real world challenges i highly recommend anyone to take this class	4

i took this course simultaneously with course  in the certificate specialization as a result i think i confused concepts from both courses in trying to fulfill assignments also i did not think there was enough time to conduct two  session coaching assignments and as a result i had to finish the assignment on the second goround because i had a hard time scheduling the coachees for more than one or two sessionsi did get a lot from the course and especially some guidance on how to go about coaching folks in a more cohesive manner that did not feel like a touchyfeely experience thank you	3

loved every minute of it could not do some of the maths that otherwise very informativelike mike browns technique enjoy the humour	4
interesting and high quality	4
it helped me to understand the basics of python in a very excellent way	4
apparently andrew ng is determined to downgrade the handicap score of this course to make it more available to a larger audience some times at expense of rigorousness i agree with most of the concessions except the assumption that even calculus is not strictly prerequired on the contrary i believe that calculus matrix and probabilisitic thinking should be required for modern engineer to be qualified to work on bigdata or we might have conceded too much of the battleground	3
very informative specifically the th week project	4
very basic stuff but informative	3
excellent course im extremely looking forward to part 	4
excellent course and teacher	4

an interesting course both from astronomical and architectural point of view for me as an architect and amateur astronomer it was a pleasure watching the lectures in this course and learning some new interesting facts about ancient architectsastronomers	4
even though some of the information seems like common sense its good to have it stated aloud i thought the pace was well done the examples used applicable and easy to understand and the instructor seemed to enjoy the topic he was teaching its a good introduction to thinking about these topics and understanding jobs and roles in any business	4
really good course for those who want to learn more about bootstrap and basic stuff about frontend technologies	4
thanks	4
excellent course this course really a great pleasure to watch and do work	4
a very complete journey into the knowledge and outcomes of cancer perfect for everyone starting out	4
probably the best mooc i have ever taken its one of the grand old ones one of the first courses ever introduced on coursera before all that nonsense of specialisationsprof ng experimented with teaching the material using different languages and he decided that octave was best for ease of learning i know exactly what he meant now i would never have realised how useful learning vectorisation would be i am most definitely going to remember the advice to prototype in octave and implement in another language if neededthe course is much easier if you have some knowledge of linear algebra you will learn octave very fast and the concepts will make much more sensea truly great course	4
awesome and very usefull course regards	4
its good course give me great insight about social media	4
this is a great course i have worked in the operations sides of the business and this course gave me much need perspective into the corporate finance and account domains thank you to the two professors involved great content and easy to follow and understand the reasoning and the why	4
this is rd time i a trying this course labeling someone just reading the slides out loud as a course is ridiculous i have to express that this is horrible please dont callout a course call it audio slidesi have a masters degree in engineering and have won scholarship all my life this is the first time i am trying out online course the courses were okay till i came to this sections mostly done by brian jaffe knowing and teaching is two different things brian i will continue with help from other materials outside the course but i have ti rate this as  star	0
since it is an introduction to swift programming i believe it should contain more information about particular topics not in depth but essence of course you have provided a official swift apple documentation so im wondering why this short course if its necessary read not necessary to know everything for beginning to know everything about swift language	3
great course explains the concepts very well	4
the course was very wellorganised clear and very interesting this is my first ever online certification course and i must say that i was so much involved in it and learned so much i dont have words to express my gratitude towards dr prof ng he has been amazing throughout the course thanks again to the professor and coursera for this fantastic course	4
very relevant information for leading a team	4
this character was made for mooc  his passionate energy is contagious and finally provides the excitement and awe that is calculus	4
such a warm approach creative extremely useful thank you so much for the effort and for the course including the extra materials and great references	4
realy interesting	4
good course	3
proseffort has been taken in putting up the assignmentsconsquality of teaching is very poor and too fast to follow through  instructors have rushed to present course material  i would not recommend this course  princeton and stanford offer much higher quality and presentation on the same topics	1
this course teaches you a lot about how the algorithms work that most courses out there dont delve into for example things like alpha the c parameter in svm which i think is a good way to learn about machine learning	3
very good course  interesting aproach from the human vision and cognitive system to the differents ways of displaying data	4
it has been a really interesting course facing all the statements involved in the sanitation	3
the course is clear to the point and open to bring in your own thoughts you are supposed to be an active member answering questions and reacting to others you can follow the course without that but it is very rewarding to read what the exercises mean to others you go through a lot of material in a few weeks  it need not take very much time but it means a lot	4
eceptional	4
this course is very great and easy to understand not only introduce us to machine learning but guide us step by step ti become professional in it very recommended	4
very enlightening of a course for those starting their journey as a data scientist or analyst	3

i have tried to start college  times i always start off motivated but then lose drive focus become intimidated by the material and gradually discouraged then i drop the classes and repeat this course taught me so much that i have already applied to my life job and education i recommend this to everyone no matter there education level age career path etc learning how to learn has taught me how to study focus retain and change the way i view a tough task whether it be a ten page essay big project for work or an errand ive dreaded for far too long thank you professors	4
good test of what we learned in the courses	3
dr chuckdatabases was a dreaded subject for me tried my hands a couple of times and left it alone thanks to you and your team if any i am pretty confident of designing small scale dbs and play around with itagain simplification of explanations holds the key here kudosrgdsumesh	4
some of the videos are really good unfortunately i feel there is little actual help to complete a project in the given timethe great thing about this course is the feeling of publishing your own game that is priceless 	3
dr carlos guestrin and dr emily fox are amazing needless to say their way of teaching is absolutely brilliant and fun to learn concepts which took me few days to learn now takes an hour or so this is primarily due to their mastery on the subject matter and their lucid way of teaching	4
i like the course content	4
peer review at times leaves a lot to be desired esp geography specific biases i would request that my final capstone submission be reviewed by course staff i got very low scores whereas i think i did a good job on it covering all required domains extensively	3
i love this course it is both funny  educational	4
the whole course was nicely designed course material was taught in a simple and entertaining way it did not get boring and was taught in a succinct manner i loved it 	4
very essential	1
thanks for course	4
love tableau very challenging class but if you make it you will know how to use tableau	4
basic ideal for begginers	4
great way to start to know a bit about consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing interesting readings studys and lectures	4
this course is badi had come upto week  while chris impey is knowledgeable and good the course structure is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired i would venture to make some suggestionsa restrict each video to a max of  minutes more than that makes one sleepyb reduce the number of videos in each module to a max of say c instead of having chris expound it like an audio reading please include some slides picturestables so that the matter to be learnt becomes self evident and chris doesnt have to speak so much a good example is the coursera the global financial crisis which i am also doing currentlyd if you feel all the material in this course has to be studied then to achieve the objectives in a and b above divide this course into two parts astronomy exploring time and space  part i  iie the written assignments are very simple and do not require any mental resources other than memory can you make the questions more challenging for example in telescopes assignment  can you not ask a question like in addition to atacama chile using google earth which other parts of the globe may be suitable for installation of ground based telescopes or to obviate the blurring effect of the atmosphere discuss the possibility of high altitude balloon based telescopes or what do you feel about the fact that since todays mobile phones have high computing ability their components can be used to make a lowcost space based interferometric telescopeskudos to chris and his team on the whole knowledge wise this is a good course	0
in my humid opinion the digital marketing specialization in the world like all the contents of the studies of its prestigious university of illinoisthey have very good teachers as i have had the opportunity to have them as drivers and tutors in addition to the high pedagogical capacity of their contents that are updated in their content and with a very high dose of innovation and transformationso i infinitely appreciate your generosity by granting me the privilege of being your students and that i hope to continue learning thank you aric rindfleischi take the course for the need to learn a new profession such as the digital markiting in the world which i wish to allow me to become a web analyst to be able to work in marketing and receive a job that is remunerated in international currencies that facilitate improvement the family income and at the same time to perform in a career that has much to do with my work as professor in management especially in industrial psychology in the areas of innovation and transformation given that they study the behavior that in the case of the course is the consumer their behaviors  opinions and shoppingin that respect i believe i am in what i have performed all my lifethanks to the special promoters aric and to all the team that are an excellent teachers and to be human for their humility and desire to teach the goodthank you	4
positive approach to the topics is solid readings are very valuablenegative some videos in week  and  have audio issues course should had a template with the course objectives learning outcomes and grading scheme  out of  quizzes didnt allow to see which questions were right or wrong social media resources such as a linkedin group for the specialization would add value but the most negative aspect was not having the slides a lot of the topics covered were presented very fast and not having the slides to review the materials made my experience in learning very frustrating i note that also the course critical perspectives on management had the same problems with the quizzes and also did not provide slides what was somewhat frustrating also also if ie is making an effort to become more relevant in this online space it should allocate human resources to monitor and interact in the discussion forums in my opinion there are a lot of opportunities to improve the student experience what i found somewhat because being this a series of courses in marketing a lot of these issues had to been fixedaddressed before the course startednonetheless my critics  which i expect to be considered as constructive critics it is important to thank ie and coursera for continuing providing online coursesi wish you luckricardo j oliveira	2
i am krishna kant kumar working as a software quality analystthrough this course i learnt how to estimate an iteration or doing an estimation of project	3
professor mehrling is fantastic i found this course supremely interesting and i learned an incredible amount from it i would venture to say that most have not taken an economics course like this one before this definitely felt like a real college course  weeks of lecture  hours of lecture each week i believe professor mehrling said inclass that the two prerequisites for this course for columbia university students not coursera users are intermediate micro and intermediate macro so the course is definitely fairly highlevel to put it into perspective i was an accountingfinance major with econ minor and have cpacfa so while not trained in economics ive had a fair amount of exposure but i definitely felt intellectually challenged and frequently had to relisten to parts of lectures definitely recommend this course learned something every minute of every lecture	4
excellent course i highly recommend this course	4
terrible course the instructor just read out of the power point no examples or case studies or insightsvery disappointed in the class	0
i had problems to understand better about asd autism spectrum disorder because my  year old daughter been diagnosed as autism spectrum disorder the doctor explain yet i still couldnt clearly understand about after learning this course i clearly understand what is asd all about	4
although still very good and insightful i found that this mooc was the less strong of the specialization and the three first moocs were the ones that taught me the most especially i found this one was missing a peertopeer assignment in mooc  we were told to write various tweets corresponding to different parts of the maslows hierarchy logically i assumed that the next peertopeer assignment will be about the results and how to interpret them and where to go from there but no furthermore we could have been asked to prepare a business plan to defend the project as taught in this mooc no again	3
fantastic enjoyable entertaining with a dash of humor highly recommended for nonstatisticians interested in improving their grasp of the field	4
could have more indepth examinations reference material would be useful	3
i like it because of excellent practice cases	4
was a major eye opener for learners and beginners i could relate with most of the biases which were introduced in this subject was feeling reluctant as always to attempt the exam papers nonetheless i downloaded all the pdfs of all the chapters for life long learning which is most important for me as i am a potential future investor	4
such an excelent course thanks a lot	4
errors in the material made it difficult to get through all past discussions on the forum are gone making it difficult to review posts by classmates	1
excelent course the professor makes it very understandable and enjoyable it could look as a shallow introduction but its not it goes deep enough into the topics so you can move forward in any direction of the machine learning	4
very good for beginners but if you have prior experience in programming this course is not for you	3
i am halfway through the course and i am really enjoying it the teacher is great and uses effective methods to explain things	4

although i believe my skills were not entirely ready for this course i was able to pick things up and follow along with relative easei believe module  was the hardest for me to graspoverall the course is a great way to start your google cloud platform learning	4
i believe that the teacher creates a great way of explaining what seems to be very complicated thought processes and he does so in a highly enthusiastic mannerthe only downside is that such explanations can be either too low level or not strong enough to explain certain phenomena for example the professor talks about how the absolute value function of x is not differentiable at zero and how a function is differentiable at a certain point when the twosided limit exists and by extension the function is continuous at that same given point however the professor in this regard never truly explains why the vshape is not differentiable and how it relates to our definition of continuity however overall a very worthwhile course and a pleasant experience	3
not as polishedcomprehensive as the previous courses especially week week and week but useful techniques nevertheless	1
nice course the teaching was so simple	4
i think it is quite good important artifacts from research on learning have been extracted and presented in a very convenient format with proper analogies	4
i learnt much more than machine learning itself from this course prof ng is a great teacher the way that he designs and teaches the course is extremely helpful for me to learn new knowledge for every one who is new to learn machine learning and hopes to learn it this should be hisher first course i enjoyed the learning experience so much thank you prof ng	4
this is a really good course i strongly recommend in this course weve learned lots of new analysis tools which are very useful in different kinds of work thank you uc davis thank you nick santos and thank you coursera for this opportunity	4

great for those starting out getting their hands wet with a free copy of tableau	3
very interesting course seems they only mention previous strategy ideas as historical note and attempt to have students not focus on strategical diagrams pestle fiveforces swat etc but think of whats going on in modern strategy and business thus have you consider new ideas that are coming out in regards to business strategy	4
the material in this course is very interesting however there were a few important issueslots of typos in the slideslots of problems with the assignmentsat the end i feel like a betatester it would be ok if it was clearly stated and if we had a discountit could also be nice to add  or  weeks to this course	2

an amazingly interesting class with many practical advices appliable in the real life i recommand it 	4
this is not a an easy course but certainly an awesome one	4
clear and concise	4
one of the best courses ive taken on coursera the lectures are tailored for online learning as opposed to videos of live lectures they are short and and full of relevant useful information this was a huge plus for me because i dont have a lot of extra time to sit through hours and hours of lectures there were guest lecturers who were experts in the field of social media marketing who provided great insight on the topic ive utilized many of the strategies learned through this course and the other courses in this specialization in my own business and have increased my social media following as well as began developing and advertising my blog	4
it was a good course and helped me out of misconceptions i had about ways of learning and also helped to reenforced some of my own belief systems i specially liked the section on procrastination and how to handle the same i will definitely try to imbibe some of the learning in my professional life and as far as possible will try to disseminate the learnings with others	3

great course comprehensive and practical very clear explanations	4
love the way teaching and assignment works here	4
a lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course many were passed onto look this up yourself which is fine but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong the group_by stuff was especially tricky as it was unlike its sql counterpart and could have used a better example eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns other than that very interesting overall and very neat datasets i would encourage having students check out kagglecom for extra credit	3
easy intro to basic structures in python some exposure on advanced structures such as counters would be useful too	3
a easy and fun course not only gives you some aspect of the brain facts highly related to the learning activities but also tells you some practical skills to help learning	4

wonderful class and very self explanatory	4
a great introduction	3
excellent course very clear explanations of concepts and lots of great examplesrecommended	4
the content and the speed that they teach you r are actually good but considering that we now have to pay  for the course you will expect more polished videos and quizzes some of the videos are just stutters repetitions and filling words its seems like they have been in a rush without decent preparation also one of the quiz questions was simply wrong this should be fixed furthermore some of the commands they present are deprecated and cannot be used anymore	1
very well done clear material  excellent lecturer	4
the course material and method of testing the understanding of the student needs to be improved despite the low quality of the quizzes the course is very inspiring the examples showed are very good and the lectures concentrated on teaching the underlying concept rather the mathematics involved which was refreshing	2
im really learning a lot and enjoying the lectures that was my first machine learning course and im really excited to learn from andrew	4
the course definitely enhanced my knowledge about the subject to a greater level and inspired me big time to get into the core of the subject and start working on the implementation of the tools and algorithms in real life applications it would have even better if more of practical applications are dealt with the course	3
total awesome knowledge on health care domain	4

great course with hands on practice of the concepts getting the tools installed is a little frustrating but once you get past that part there are a lot of good exercises to apply what you are learning	4
absolutely great so far	4
the professor just read the slides and most of the slide and content are repetitive the content of the entire course can be studied in less than  hour so did the other courses of this specialization its not a good course and i think its not worth to purchase these classes	0

difficult to understand due to her very strong accent and poor audio meaning i spend  of my effort trying to make out what shes saying as it turns out all she does is read from the slides no additional insight nothing this makes it boring to hear and she comes across with no personality although a quick ratemyprofessors search tells us a very different story a real shame since people seem to really like her at any rate after one week of this course and not seeing any improvement ive decided to call it quits	0
excellent course however you cant take this as a cissp training course	4

the instructions provided by professor colleen are very clear and the whole course is well organized thanks university of michigan and coursera staff	4
signature class not only introduce some basic and useful tools but also talk how and when to use it	4

excellent course for learning the key basics to being able to interact with web objects	4

an essential introduction to the rest of the specialization program but not too much information included in the course by itself	3
this is an excellent course especially for someone with near zero knowledge of financial statements and their analysis the concepts are clearly presented with interesting details and supporting examples of their use the inane comments by cartoon characters using poorly simulated accents is only mildly irritating	3
the most useful course of the specialisation	4
this course in informative but not very and it is rather boring	2

this is a great review and reference for the fundamental knowledge of dsp the class uses the concept of vector space and basis to explain all the linear transform in signal processing which helps my understand of the material you probably need some background of college sophomore and junior level math and system knowledge but the math in this class is not dull rather it focuses on applying on practical problems especially on music signal processin the filter section there are not much material about windowing but in general the material is adequate as an entry level class of dspthe only thing i dont like of the class is it does not provide the lecture slides i like to take notes when watching the video and i found it much easier to go back reviewing the material or looking for reference when there is a paper copy in hand than digging into dozens of videos	4

great teachers and information i cannot believe i can learn so much from my house	4
this class information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course the teachers while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon im not sure if they are primarily researchers who arent used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them as someone who was taking this class without that advantage i was quickly lost among all the jargon to the point where i just had to stop im hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background	1
great course lots of examples	4
over all a good experience to get a solid understanding of basic graphic design aspects	3
i love this class it teaches much better than the game theory i took	4

if you love to see a couple of entertaining movies about robots and some interesting concepts about them grab some popcorn and take this course because hey its about cool robotsif you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate i would not recommend to participate in this course the videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what i think this course should be about but there are a bunch of quizzes which are sometimes quite off the lecture material and you have to research a lot to get all of the questions right i managed to solve all quizzes in the end but it was some kind of a frustrating and discouraging process	1
maybe at begin it is a little difficult but once you can catch up with your teacher and classmates you will find it will be ok if you are a beginner with little knowledge or no basic knowledge about c program it is a good challenge for you to have a try if you are a experienced programmer or already get some program conceptskillno matter it is cc or java its good for you to have a practice	4
a very very basic course  i will suggest using it as a refresher rather than anything else it is however very easy to pass and get a certificate 	3

thanks for teaching how to learn 	4
great and useful	3
this introductory course is perfect it gives you time to think you dont have to spend too much time in order to understand the materialconcepts and it is selfsufficient i would suggest to set the playback rate at  since the teacher talks really slow in addition i would like to see the teacher talking like a human being instead of reading his notes in a black background but this is not super important for me all in all i totally recommend it	4
one piece of improvement is to stream line the peer graded assignment i noticed a slight disconnect between the writing prompt and the grading rubric particularly around the implementation of metrics to track success of content improvement initiatives what would be wrong to use the grading rubric as a baseline for the writing prompt that can be used as a guideline for student to follow when drafting his response this would save a lot of back and forth between submitting a blank sheet of work in order to see how the grading is set up then going back to adjust the original work to make it fit the grading sheet	3
i learned a bunch of things thank you very much	4

i am only halfway through this course and it is already a favorite out of the handful of courses ive successfully completed through coursera jonathan bisss passion for the subject matter brought me from an infatuation with beethoven to a fullon heed over heels love i am a vocalist i was classically trained as a child lately a lot more bluesy but do not have a strong background in theory most of what i know is through an innate understanding of harmony structure etc this is whetting my appetite for musical structure and thoroughly illustrating that musical analysis is so very exciting there really arent words for how much i love this course it has really brought me joy	4
really digested and simplified for people unfamiliar with financial terms or without an strong background on economicsstrongly recommended to grasp basic as well as complex terms and definitions explained in a very simple way	3

excellent course that provides many tips and techniques for mastering not only difficult subjects but will also assist in your day to day ability to uptake knowledge	4
the course reminds me of my math lessons lots of formulas and apparatus but little motivation except in the optional videos as in the first part of the specialization the advised book about pgm is highly recommended to pass the final exam the book or at least some research papers are necessary 	3
fantastic course	4

the information contained was very useful and immediately applicable i felt sorry for the professors during the videos as they looked very uncomfortable in front of the camera and was sometimes a bit difficult to listen to as they didnt seem to have comfort reading the teleprompter the information of how our brains function in long term memory building and understanding procrastination in more of a neurochem response was greatly appreciated techniques provided were all immediately applicable and can easily be expounded upon i am recommending this course to anyone intimidated by stem also recommending for several girl scout troops thank you for the opportunity to audit this course and learn deeply from it	3

the glitches with coursera itself are not excusable and should be taken as a black mark against the organization they made the professors and michigan state look less than average and caused confusion among the students the material is good and it makes me learn about the camera that i use and try new things	2
the instructors lecture sounded too robotic and i feel like he didnt make any effort to explain some of the principles or simplify the course to the audience it feels like he just copied concepts and pasted them into the lecture and then read them quick	2
the instructor for this course was great he was very responsive to students questions concerns	3
this is a very useful course that apart from the video lectures presents a comprehensive bibliography supporting key points raised during the study the delivery of information and a means of control and organization of the forum and peer review process appear to confirm with important contemporary standards of englishlanguage teaching id certainly recommend the course to nonnative speakers of english who need to acquire academic literacy skills	4

please provide more lectures we depend on selflearning more than lectures in order to pass	2

im somewhat disappointed i attend almost all other courses in this specialization except of data product and this one is on my opinion the weakest one a lot of links to useful information though this is more reference guide rather than a real training coursei can say even more initially i start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one for now i think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this oneive also took andrew ng course on machine learning in the past and my learning experience was much better in lectures on some concepts like regularization im pretty sure i would not understand anything if i had not been familiar with the subject before	2

r programming has solid information and exercises on just that however the videos and sections for each week are not very clearly structured sometimes the end assignment can take many times the number of hours the rest of the content in a week requires id be careful about taking this course while working unless you can devote serious time to programming projects on your off days that stated the course is excellent otherwise	3

pros information is perfect for anyone looking at business intelligence as a career field or already in the career field itself i found the first week to challenge my onthejob knowledge of a fuller set of concepts and general terminologycons the wording on the quiz questions in some cases seems much different than the ppt slides and the instructors language update the wording is a significant challenge even when advancing into the more complex topics i have had many differences of opinions on the solutions based on wording in the requirements	2

nice introductory course very clear ans structured	3
the course is well structured and provides a good introduction however i expected a bit more from a course that costs  pounds than just a few clips on how to install and setup softwarecreate a github account etc this information is available for free online on the websites of the respective softwarei understand that such an introduction is needed for the course but then do not offer it as a separate  pound module instead include it for free with any other specialization you can buy	1

i feel that this is a great course for all levels of calculus students those who have just taken up a calc course in high school those who want to review calculus for higher studies or even those who want to learn calculus because they find it an interesting subject and want to gain more understanding of it the instructor has put in a good amount of effort to explain not just the topics themselves but also to build up some level of conceptual understanding and insight without delving too much in depth and keeping his lectures jargonfree this has ensured that all learners are on the same level and can reap the benifits of learning calculus another take away from the coruse is that learners come to appreciate that calculus is both interesting as well as useful a total contrast to the popular perception that it is confusing boring and can be learned only rote learning of forumlas	4

modpo is not only one of the greatest courses with regards to opening up the mystery of modern poetry but due mostly to the methods employed by professor al filreis it is both a community and an experience that can open up new paths of thinking in all areas of your life including areas not even tangentially touching on poetry first he empowers every student to be both a teacher and a learner he gives everyone of the nearly  students an equal voice while he gently leads through his brilliance he is patient without being patronizingif you watch a couple of the videos and if you spend an hour on the discussion forums you will see a joint learning experience with a fully engaged professor a well informed team of grad student teaching assistants and a crazy dedicated team of what modpo calls community teaching assistants or as coursera calls them mentorsby the time you understand that emily dickinson was not writing nonsensical poems but instead explaining the universe and humans role in it and especially by the time you begin to grasp what gertrude stein william carlos williams john cage sid corman or frank ohara are really saying you will have a hard time not only of ever looking at a poem the same way but even of contemplating the universe the same way this class can truly be a path to enlightenment	4

this course is a useful if superficial introduction the concepts presented are pretty basic but foundational the quizzes are very easythe instructor covers the topic in a pleasant and clear way i would however have liked examples of a more visual nature show dont tellironically the course materials show disappointingly little concern for user experience or design the slides look like they were thrown together in a rush and without much care for design or even spellchecking the quiz multiple choice answers are laid out in an awful confusing antiux way someone should spend a few minutes fixing all of this	2
a lot of useful techniques and motivation	4
well explained it would be more good if an entirely new worksheet is given for work at the end of course	3

great course series that forced me to take some steps design docs that id normally skimp on and in doing so realizing their true valuethroughout coursera id love to see more instructor involvement in the courses the  peer review system is a double edge sword on one hand i never felt i had an instructor looking at my work but on the other hand where else can you get constructive critiques on the internet overall great experience star for feeling a little bit on rails and not feeling the instructor involvement	3

well structured course	4
the video lectures provide a clear and concise introduction to interesting topics in machine learning ml however the exercises are very general and use black box ml algorithms for most of the solutions for me the exercise structure was more confusing than educating i am aware that this is the intro course to the specialization and i am looking forward to actually building the algorithms in the future courses too bad you can only take the entire specialization over the course of  months and not at your own pace especially since the homework is checked automatically	2
very helpful	4

the best course	4
i believe that this course is a good course for starting the journey of machine learning	4
excelent introduction to the basics gives you solid ground do keep improving totally recommend	4
excessive use of graphlab create which is not an industry standard	1
this course was a very good introduction of hci videos were very clear and the heuristical theme had plenty of examples which make really easy to understand them i would have appreciated more assignments since there were so many topics there was many themes that could not be learned in a deeper way	3

rather superficial the poorest one of the modules so faryou have to shoot at the end i wish i new it in advance i wouldnt have enrolled	1
very informative course	3
excellent course for a beginner or postbeginner as the fundamentals of pronunciation are dealt with slowly in the first half and then it races ahead with useful language and vocabulary for everyday contemporary situations like talking about hobbies using the internet etc etc stylistically the professor may seem dry and mechanical to some but i liked her no fluff she moves at quite a pace for falsebeginners would have bene nice to ave had access to the chinese vocabulary during the course not at the end looking forward to the next course	3
a very poor course the teacher just ask questions in order to stimulate students but doesnt teach anything incorrect terminology ahah please study aaron allston works before inventing other wordstest are cool	1
i was glad to get exposure to famous algorithms through this class but i dont feel like i really developed an intuition for reasoning about their runtime the class was challenging but mostly for the wrong reasons i spent more time and energy pouring over the answers to tricky quizzes and having to implement algorithms exactly as described in the lecture notes rather than really truly learning it also took me much longer than the  hours per week advertised to complete each week	2
despite not being very fond of areas such as humancomputer interaction i found this course to be wellpresented and useful definitely a necessity for anyone planning on building secure software	4
very good start to understand basics of clinical research and its statistics	4
mr cockell is the best his teachings is so good and it can be seen that he is so passionate about the astrobiology and he is very engaging it is like story telling the concepts are so clearly given and the assessments do question your knowledge	4
good general overview only wish it was longer and could cover material in more detail	3
great	4
excellent mooc a great introduction to the basic elements of statistics i had studied statistics years ago in my bachelor but almost forgot everything this course greatly helped me revive all the elementary concepts the teachers explain complex things in simple terms easy to follow and the funny examples have brought a smile to my face more than once and twice during the mooc finally the collaboration with professional illustrators adds great value to the course a big deal of effort has gone into its making and it truly pays off i just wished thered be an intermediate and advanced statistics course to keep digging into itthanks a lotalejandro	4
good course to start with thanks a lot	4
good course	4
opened my vision to comprehend education to pragmatism	4
this is one of the best end enjoyable courses of coursera	4

i was expecting harder course with more content but this course for absolute beginners to web so i guess i cant say much bad about course only that i would like if it had more content and harder projects	3
a great course	4
informational and easy to follow thank you	3
i feel robbed i did not get any feedback on my work only a classmate gave their ok yes there is something writteni did not follow the course to get a certificate but to learn and to revceive feedback if you dont have a special purpose for the certificate  dont pay a cent for this	0
very theoretical and somewhat dry if you are interested in applied machine learning techniques for text retrieval and analysis this is not really the course to take gives a solid background though which in my opinion every aspiring data analyst needs	2
great course	4
it appears the teacher doesnt take the necessary steps to polish content and tests everything feels unstructured and adlib course videos dont seem to follow any kind of logic or purpose and tests are based on highly subjective content but are not prepared to deal with the subjectivity of reviewers ie forcing them to provide feedback instead of giving points arbitrarily	1
everything is so great about this course the only bad thing i can say about it is that all the errors in the videos and slides have not been corrected since the course came out	3
very good  mediumlevel for an indian student	4
overall okay but feels quite outdated as a marketing professional and child of the digital age i feel like the course didnt go deep enough	2
well explained and useful knowledge i like courses where i decide when to do the tasks without deadlines	4
course is great and very useful for thorough understanding of thermodynamics but exergy and second law efficiency was not discussed it should also be included	3
the course was still useful and with new information but i really found it lacking cohesion with the overall specialization and with its own content	1
excellent course very informative would recommend to teachers and parents	4
really interesting it offers a lot of information about meetings vocabulary exercises	4
massive improvement on delivery compared to course  i would suggest to take the t	3
this course doesnt help much	1
this was a very interesting class taught in such a manner that an undergraduate student majoring in any area would find interesting and educational their is very much to learn for anyone	4
too easy	1

great course great instructorvery simple and straight forward with good ways to apply theory and nice interviews at the end of each week	4
its easy to follow up well structured	4
very very simple recommended if you need a fast and simple introduction to finance	2
the course is great with plenty of knowledge a little defect is about description about assignment as the forum discussed several quizzes may confusing	3
pretty challenging compact delivery	4
this was a fabulous training very eyeopening	4
it was a great learning experience professor not only teaches the concepts but socialise common law principles structures and history through examples and discussion at the same time a very generous initiative by coursera to provide learning opportunity for underprivileged	4
this  weeks were very educational i got a chance to learn new and exciting stuff thank you very much for this experience	4
i learned to understand the structure of the algorithm several codes are given only one solution that with the support of java shtml css can be visualized data to make minor changes to the code and change the visualizationwriting code dr complicated but when we look at you see the familiar approaches to writing and take them to his applicationthank you	4
it is a great class and teaches me a lot	4
very practical and concret i was afraid about the manipulation tactics but its realy clear and deep thank you	4
excelent course from beginners	3
the right step towards building basics after introduction to synths some very good inputs like manual control of the filter cutoff etc overall extremely informative	4
a must course for students of all discipline motivates you to learn varied subjects and topics	4
this course was difficult to follow and the free trials offered seemed forced upon us lexalytics isnt available for a mac so i couldnt even use it i think this portion of the specialization would be much better if it focused more on the value of these tools rather than trying to get us to install them it might be useful for some especially those in bc or willing to play around with the tech but it was a waste of time for me i would have preferred to just take a look at some proven case studies linked to the tools	1
great platform for learning and gathering new ideas	4
very helpful and interesting course 	4
it is great	4
i absolutely loved this course i found it to be really interesting and insightful i think the professor was excellent and explained certain concepts in a very simple and understandable manner  highly highly recommended	4
best course i have ever attended both online or in class	4
well explained	4
it is really interesting informational  nicely structured course i learned a lot it gave me confidence to pursue my career in machine learning thanks to andrew	4
dear mr everlythe course is very well organized and objective maybe it could be offered in more languages  at least with subtitles  so more people would benefit from italthough i had not had any previous experience with pfa i am pretty sure that i had been trying to find this field of knowledge for a long time i am a psychologist with a psychosociological orientation from brazil and i have been working with human rights and community development in different settings and projects for the last  years also in other countries for short periodsduring the first simulation video i was really touched especially because i realized that i had found something that made complete sense to me as a psychologist especially when our mentor stressed its not therapy i am not a clinical psychologist and i did not come across these techniques and studies while i was at the university and when i pictured myself working with refugees or the people at my city  i realized that we can apply pfa not only to people at catastrophes but also to people living in very violent areas in some parts of rio de janeiro or são paulobefore the course i was not satisfied with my resources to work in some settings am i going to provide psychological therapy no it is not what i do but the pfa yes that i can picture myself doing it and have been doing something similar all my life so all i can say is thank you i will dive inbest regardsgabriela	4
very well explained for both biologists and computer scientists	3
greatly enjoyed this coursecoveringbasic concepts used as a framework for discussion eg pstechnical innovations to incorporate such as d printing augmented realitytrends that businesses need to keep an eye on customer cocreation managing negative brand image a shift in the balance of power towards the individual the customer and a lot morei loved the hands on case studies the supplemental readings and the discussion boards where i could see different perspectives from different parts of the world professor aric has a pleasant and clear presentation style and the learning seemed pretty effortless to me as i just worked through the material as presentedvery glad i took this course and moving on to the other courses in this specialization and others toothe coursera platform gives me an opportunity for flexible skill development which is very precious to me	4
great course	3
excellent course first  weeks were very technical but highly informative quite a bit of accounting knowledge is required to understand the work last week of lessons were more simple and intuitive to understand but overall a very insightful module	4
so informative and im thankful	4
very good and beneficial	4
the content of this course is great i am provided with detailed contexts of certain movements and how they developed under the influence of thinkers and artists	4
another fantastic course that gives real insight into how the human body acquires and responds to infections for all those who have been affected by one of the conditions here or who are simply in the biological and diagnostic processes involved in infections i would highly recommend this course	4
gets progressively tougher but loses momentum in the end i highly recommend taking additional courses in r as the programming requirements are not exponentially increasing and by the end it suddenly peaks to a huge demand	2
very good structured course also good for not native speaking people	4
i loved this class learning about happiness was harder then it sounds i loved all the science behind being happy thank you	4
awesome this only world i have  i have learned great	3
the topics are of interest however the course content could be presented better in most instances it is hard to predict where the instructor is writing and is hard to read also writes over the slide material	1
pretty good beginner course but doesnt go deep enough hopefully the next courses in the series are more informational	3
thank you andrew course mentors and all those who made this valuable information available	4
well done overall i would have liked a little more detail with some of the formulas mentioned but overall i felt like i learned quite a bit	3
excellent very clear	4
excellent course the practice and excercises are very useful	4
three words describing this course lifechanging awarenesscreating and relieving i trully recommend the content will surprise you	4
the course is quite comprehensive and is taught by someone who is highly competent and also has a very nice disposition andrew selection of topics of the syllabus has been done mindfully	4
easy to understand it helped me pick up essential concepts required for a task at work	4
the course is great but there are some serious glitches happening in the coursera platform that desperately need attention i just went from showing that i did not pass the peer review section and in the next second was greeted by a big green course completion certificate	3
i absolutely love everything that i am able to learn and gain from these courses and using them in everyday photography	4
well thought out sequencing of covered topics decent incorporation of learned capabilities in subsequent exercises	3
itsgood	4
the course is very easy to understand and implement	3

good course with hands on projects i wish it was a little longer	3

gives you a strong basics	3
very helpful and detailed	4
excellent for people with no chinese language experience and also very helpful as review for beginners with some experience	4
very interesting course	4
this course is very challenging i may not have had the proper background in mathematics to full absorb the material similarly i may have to busy of a lifestyle to have properly focused on this class	2
learned a lot recommend	4
great content followed up with good programming exercises please keep up the good work	4
upon the first few views of the subject material presented in the form of dramatized episodes i was skeptical if this course was worth its time i was pleasantly surprised once we moved into motivation in the st century and the course only improved from there though the multiple long videos in the financial crisis module felt redundant a meaningful course as long as you can engage yourself with the material rather than rely on their subpar assignments and quizzes to engage you i also did not participate in any discussions but perhaps if i had this course would have been rated  stars	3
excellent overview also the pace is awesome	4
i was interested in this course but as it stands it is more like marketing hype than a proper course for one thing it tries to cover far too much material in  weeks within the limited scope of the beta test i started the node red stuff it looks easy but the lecturer didnt make it clear what it was for anywaya much more thorough introduction should have been given to everythingthe lectures on the rasberry pi were a joke in order to do the course within  weeks i would have had to order a rasberry pi before getting to these lectures a clear guide to course prerequisites and the rasberry pi and sensehat must be providedneither of the tutors seem very happy about their job this is a small point and not a show stopperoverall  dont issue this course without major revisions perhaps a new course team	1
great course for those dont have programming experience	3
awesome course content and teaching techniques used by michael manninokudos	4
very knowledgable	4
great introduction to interactive plotting mapping and shiny deeper examples would be helpful	3

as a marketing student i think teachers speach very useful and fantastical  i learn about a lot of company about luxury and fashion strategy	4
this was an extremely difficult course for me that required repeatedly reading the course material and utilizing wikipedia to access a deeper understanding of the many organ and cell functions the course was very thorough and well structured i found that as i advanced in the course i was able to find answers and explanations for anything that was initially unclear to me had it not been for the collaboration of coursera duke university and the course instructors i would not have been able to access a course of this quality	4
very good course informative and inspiring	4

this course is very useful not only in commercial negotiation but also in daily affairs such as dealing with office disputes through mediation or arbitration i think those methods and concepts are quite pragmatic and really enlightened me a lot	4
the lecturers and interviews are relatively short and the quizzes dont ask that much of you nevertheless this is a fantastic introduction to the south and explores a good breath of the arts and culture the depth and passion of william ferriss knowledge is obvious he left me wanting more so i bought two of his multimedia books on amazon although he modestly didnt plug them i had to hunt them downhttpwwwamazoncoukwilliamferrisebhizgwrefsr_ntt_srch_lnk_qidsr	4

thanks for all is a great course thanks coursera and thanks for each opportunity	3
good course	4
very rushed incomplete examples and gaps in content im not sure what audience coursera is aiming for but it doesnt seem to be anyone who doesnt already know a programming language	1
instructor was very enthusiastic about the course i thought it was well structured and its good to get a framework for things as someone who came in as pretty conservative leaning on the environmental issue it helps me become more knowledgeable about why the epa can do the things it can and a better understanding of how environmental law works more information is always better	3
this was a wonderful course prior to taking it i had no idea how much project planning and management entailed additionally i wasnt aware of the plethora of programs currently on the market that helps one facilitate the process of planning and managing a project i found this course very insightful thank you	4

wonderful course gives good insights on the machine learning algorithms thank you so	4
wwonderful coursegreat professor	4

this course is highly engaging and i enjoyed learning the foundations needed to be an effective teacher	4
strongly recommended for physicians	4
quit a tough course but worth your handwork	4
dr chuck in one of the best profs ive ever had even though ive never actually met him	4
this course is as awesome as the other ones in the series i love the way things from all the coursessql accessing data from web apis etc merges together in the end this course complements the others and the series as a whole teaches one enough to develop some useful programsi wish there were more of coding exercises rather than just code completion overall a great learning experience with dr chuck the pythonista	4
it is great learning experience	4
good for basic knowledge in cancer biology	4
the classes are easy to follow the give an incremental understanding and satisfaction	4

great material and lecture videos it covered important concepts we need to know about spark and helped me to learn further assignments were on real datasets and helped me to explore different apis if spark and scala	4

a nice course about kennedy i didnt know much about him and this course make me able a little more to understand his qualities and his drawbacks	3
this was my first course in social sciences and i thoroughly enjoyed it prof wright maintains a very fine balance between philosophy and science which makes it suitable for all enthusiastsa good course for beginners in the buddhist enquiry	4

good explanations of data collection types that are used in python exercises could probably be a bit more challenging but it will do for absolute beginners thank you	4
good course overall	2
it was a great introduction to data scientist	4
i thought the course was excellent	4
pacing of this course was all overinterface and abstract classes were introduced and the material and lessons were easy to follow sorting using bubble sort caparable and comparator operators were also easy to follow the final week presented topics on exception and trycatchfinally but provided no practical programs for a student to write to ensure the topics were understoodthe problem was in week  ngrams meant to teach some very important concepts about markov and predictive text but failed somewhat since the quizes were not clear and the grading a bit harsh in the quizes problems were presented and you either had the right output or you did not there was no checks available that allowed a student to figure out why code produced the wrong output in other modules and courses in this series input was provided and expected out based on the input was provided to verify code was working correctly not in section   you wrote the code took the quiz and if you got the answer wrong were left scratching your head as to why since there were really no means to checkdont mistake this feedback as saying the course was bad  it was actually quite good if the course material for week  is updated to include clearer instructions and some better checks to ensure code is working correctly then i will change my review from a four star its more  than  to a five star	3
it could go a bit faster	3
amazing course	4
i really liked itinteresting and thought provoking	4
very useful course and excellent quality content	4
the content presented in this course is really complete and well presented it is definitively worth taking unfortunately there were a few organization errors like missing video and quizzes errors on a side note its great to be able to learn from hinton since he has created many of the techniques presented in the course	3
i am a little over halfway through this course and i would recommend it to any teacher or any person who just loves art exploring themes in modern art is presented in an accessible way through short engaging videos there is a resource list with further readings to help you get as indepth with the topics as you would like and a list of artworks used in the lesson so you can refer to all of them at once i plan to do more moma courses on coursera and hopefully visit moma sometime soon this review was written by a teacher and former art maj	4
good course love itand learn a lot from it	4
this is one of my favourite course i recommend it	4
its very useful course	4
really helpful	4
great course everyone interested on a scientific comprehension of buddhism and mindfulness should take it	4
it was a great course to learn basic korean id definitely recommend it	4
its a very nice course if youre doing some refreshing of college chemistry	3
a course worthy of learning and filled with valuable information	3
terrific overview of the emergence of the modern middle east provides keen insight into the role of the west	4
this course should be revised the material was lacking just static images no real time coding overall engagement for the courses was also lacking the instructor sounded low quality and sometimes a bit hard to understand i could no complete this course unfortunately	1
this course helps a lot in understanding concepts of machine learning and covers required tools to quickly apply machine learning to solve the seemingly difficult problems in the beginning i would highly recommend this tool for the folks who want to begin understanding the domain of machine learning and interested in building the expertise	4
let me say that this is a great course and that i enjoyed it very muchmy only problem is with the assignment that are in my opinion a bit limited and most of the time they focus on liner algebra implementations rather than give a better understanding of the algorithmmost of the time the assignments focus on implementing a formula where the algorithm itself is already written for usthat is good as a first step but in the long run it doesnt give you some practical skills when you want to apply the algorithm to an external dataseti would suggest to add some challenges maybe ungraded keggle style like provided this dataset try to get a score better than a value this will spark some discussion and it would help to apply the concepts and the practical tricks to a real chewed problem	3
i liked the course it really is a true beginners class i think the instructor taught well with good examples illustrating each point i deducted a point because the exercises were too easy and there werent enough of them i understand that its not easy to come up with a good grading system but the grading system definitely could be better	3
i really enjoied with this course  i feel exiciting	4
great course overall good lectures and good exercises	3
very interesting and good course thank you so much for the great lectures	4
the contents in this course are really useful and this course help me in study in deed i actually follow the rules mentioned in course and get improved	4
i loved this course as it helped me understand things that didnt make sense before	3
excellent course and prof raj excellent person thanks for this opportunity 	4
i liked the way this course added more to our plates we learned more useful information that caused a need for taking notes and seeking further information this course also provided great background with the interactive videos that were entertaining but also sequenced in such a way that a student would understand clarification would follow in the later videos if not garnered by the first video clip with the questions i enjoyed the pacing detail research based knowledge and assessment at the end  even if i did continuously read a few questions incorrectly the approaches i now know and understand thank you for these courses	4
easy to understand and follow especially appreciate the importance put on accessibility	4
excellent material and lecturing	4
good starter course	4
i think this course if poorly organized the instructor is really trying to show us that the real life data sets and databases are messy but providing only written instructions for me it proved useless i for one need to see what other people are doing and not read long pages of horrible written explanationsi paid for the course just to be able to do the exercises which i also think its a minusall in all it didnt enhance my career prospects mostly because nothing useful was taught here wouldnt recommend anyone to pay for it	0
fantastic opportunity to learn from the bestthank you kindlydgh	4
the course is very interesting the jupiter notebook is very usefuli dont like that many examples are very usspecific some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside usaupdate im lowering my grade from  stars to  stars because of very confusing assignments often its not clear the requirement of the task it takes very long to understand also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures	2
a very good introductory course	4
thank you professor  you are a great teacher	4

very useful course to begin with python	3
the course is amazing the professor gives you right examples an amount of information for understanding the topics after you finish the course you are not an expert but you have the right concepts and knowledge for developing your projects furthermore the additional material interviews are pretty interesting i audit the course but i did all the homework you must do the homework to really understand the topics	4
great material the inclusion of case studies definitely helps	4
a fabulous course that gives you the true aspect of statistics into real applications with the help of a realistic dataset and a software package many thanks to the lecturers and the developers for creating this course this is of great help for people like me who have a keen interest in getting into analytics but needs a direction of where to start from	4

the content of the course is reasonable and gives an introduction to the uninitiated the peer review sysetm however relies on the experience and knowledge of others which is a flaw in how some of the coursera modules are evaluatedif you are looking to expand your technical knowledge opt for a course the has an automated test system such as the courses on data structures and algorithmsif you are just considering studying engineering this course and specialization will be a decent and simplistic introduction into the field	2

this course is very good my only complaint is that this course only has a reading option with a handful of short videos the short videos are extremely helpful because i learn from both hearing and seeing thus i learn best when i see the problem being worked outit is x more helpful to me when i see the problem being worked out as well as hear them explaining the process i watched the videos over and over again to grasp and excel in the concept however with two hours of just plain reading assigned i found it harder to grasp it didnt show the problem being worked out although it does explain the process i just feel as though at the very least there should have been a listening optiontext to speech option or otherwise have the readings broken up into videos	3
this course is really meant for beginning writers for young readers the information is good and at a pace that is easy to follow if you are an advanced writer or have experience it may not be as valuable for you however if you are just starting to look at becoming a professional or have limited experience beyond writing for yourself you will find this a very valuable learning experience	3

great course	4
very interesting subject	4
overall this course is tough for me in my opinion the course title is not suitable which is introduction the word introduction generally means something basic and fundamental however the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hardfurthermore the assignment instructions are not clear enough ie what steps need to be followed to complete each question so it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum i know in each week forum there is one discussion specifically for assignment ie assignment x tips which is good but i think the forum is not a good place since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out not in an easy to follow ordermoreover i do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures i mean it is too many new things in the assignment although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves in general the assignments should at least reflect the lectureslastly in my humble opinion this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages though the title is introduction	1
excellent content and very practical	4
it is a pleasure to be on this course it is a challenge that you must take	4
presentation is good concepts explained in a simple and clear manner missing interactivity which is very important to retain the understanding of the concepts explained	2

a really excellent coursethis is the first online course ive taken so i cannot compare it to others either on coursera or other mooc platforms but i can say that it was perfect for my needs and i learnt a lot from it the math content  of which obviously there must be a lot of  is very wellexplained and andrew takes care to require little more than a highschool level expertise to understandthe programming exercises were slightly challenging but not overly so and helped solidify understanding  and hey theres always that little thrill of excitement when you see your program begin to give you real answers and you realise that youve just written a program to recognise letters when given just a bunch of pixelsi didnt use the forums much during the course myself but they appeared to be very wellsupported by knowledgeable and helpful mentors tom mosher in particular seemed to be onhand all day every dayas to andrew ng the lecturer he clearly has a deep and extensive knowledge of his subject matter but his presentation is always kind enthusiastic and helpful so id like to pass on my thanks to him for making and presenting this course	4
the analysis and materials of this course are very useful a great section if the matlab script for calculating the converter poles and zeros can be provided will be even better	4

the course s outstanding well designed and well presented but it should be with statement of accomplishments because in third world countries the concept of online open courses will take time to gain acceptance so in order to prove the worth of these course they demand documentary proof  is big amount    pkr in rd world countries so its not possible to pay for one course	3

widened the views on iot industry but it wasnt too challenging good starter course for iot field	4
the material was self explanatory and easy to understand references where provided and this helped me gain a wider knowledge of the course	4
i thought the content was great but i thought the assignments were too onerous i did the first one but i didnt feel like i learned from it and peer feedback was very slow i looked at the other assignments but i thought they only asked me to put to paper things i was already thinking about anyway given the untimely and low quality of peer feedback on the first assignment i didnt feel like id learn anything from completing and submitting any assignments i refuse to buy a webcam for coursera i have a phone with that capability but the coursera app doesnt support it for identity verification so i cant get a certification anyway i thought the content was interesting but too basic to pay for the major value i see in the certification path is extensive feedback on the capstone project as i thought peer feedback came too late and wasnt extensive enough to be valuable i do think the instructor does a good job of presenting the content	2
its a welltaught course and very interesting too	4
informative and intensive course	4
really excellent	4
this course is welldeveloped and welldelivered if one is a complete novice start at the beginning of this specialty on ones own schedule on demand at the speed of light and at an affordable price  and be confident of significant advances in ones knowledge of internet function in general and python in particular it is a brave new world i often feel like wylie coyote staring through my toes suddenly realizing things have changed this course fixes that feeling	3
the instructors rushed through the javascript part unlike the previous sections this section assumes that one knows java and its syntax beforehand	0
the content was good however prof clifton is very difficult to listen to and watch on the videos mistakes in the ppt and her presentation skills do not meet the expected standard she seemed as though she didnt know the material and is seemingly unaware of what is required for successful oncamera delivery of lectures	2

it is a course  recommendable with much material available	4
i loved this course professor chemerinsky did an amazing job making this course easy to understand he provided real court examples after he explained the concept of the law i strongly recommend this course of you are trying to get a basic understanding of constitutional law	4

i almost need to come back and listen to these lectures again this course is pretty technical  it involves several different digital tools i found that it was possible to do well on the quizzes without really mastering the technical tools now that im trying to put them into use more fully i find i dont understand them as well as i should have i take responsibility for perhaps not pushing to understand the first time  but i also encourage coursera and randyhlavac to perhaps include something more than did you get an account checks for the tools  to make sure students grasp how to use the tools before they move on	3
this course is a better option to start with programming and that also with python	2
challenging at times but doable with effort and quite rewarding upon success recommended	3
it was a wonderful experience to read the structure of data before delving into the advanced statistical levels of data analysisthe need for inclusion or exclusion of dependent variables or dimension reduction in regression analysis can be intuitively understood and visualized using data exploratory techniques and then we have the clue as what to do in the next levelit is like putting the whole characteristic of the data under full control	4

great course and well taught as well	4
even though the video lectures discussion forums swirl  reading resources are informative there is a huge disconnect between the assignments  what is taught it is impractical for people who have just been introduced to rwith no background in programming to take up this coursethe graded assignments should be made simpler or should be preceded by smaller ones which help firsttimers get used to coding in r i do not think swirl even though a valuable resource achieves this task remotely	2
thanks for this awesome course 	4

very generic advice although the interviews with childrens writers were illuminating and helpful the marking system was inaccurate for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasnt good solid advice about setting character scene and place and ideas to help you out of writers block the two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience some of the activities were repetitious but i guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist	1

great intro to ruby	4
in my opinion the professors accent and speaking style makes the content difficult to understand in addition the course does not seem to have been properly designed	1
i am not sure if the course will help me in any degree but that is solely due to my laziness low selfesteem and year long struggle with depression however with regards to the course itself i think it can be very usefull a lot of the learing tips seem common sense but for me it was very important that all of them were supported by science  not only the kind of advice that any person could give you i can only regeret that i did not take a similar course when at school or at the universtiy i am sure i will use or at least try to use some of the techniques and do more reading on the subject using both the web and the publications mentioned throughout the course of the lectures in my opinion the fact that the lectures are divided into rather short segments is beneficial as it helps to go through the course even without having much time and incresaes motivation to continue as one is not faced with having to listen for a lecture for an hour or so i often found myself only plannig to view one short videos and ending up in wieving a couple one after another not noticing how much time passed finally i think that both of the lecturers are a great benefit of the course as they bring a lot of enthusiasm and good will and seemed people i would like to know in person or at least that was my impressiongreetings and thanks from poland to both of them	4

course goes over the most basic points but also allows you if you are interested to dive much deeper into the content seems it has everything any project manager would want so definitely worth taking would have wanted the questions to be a little more difficult and potentially more questions to help make sure the information was retained overall a great course	3

interesting to try r hands on could have made more definitive statements on the usefulness of each test there was lots of you could have a look at this analysis or this one or this one without covering why each one would be particularly good for this case some of the later exercises also made quite of a leap in terms of what you were expected to know about r syntax although the follow up answers were good if you didnt understand what was expected	2
fun assignments and informative lessons	4
i would re	3
excellentteachers are very enthusiastic about teaching which is helpful when learning	4
course is good content wasnt updated after its initial run in  so doesnt include recent developments could include a section on ethereum programming exercises could be structure better and unit tests could be exposed to students	3
awesome course great exercises although can be frustratingly challenging at times divide and conquer and dynamic programming new to me have learned a lot highly recommended	4
lots of unnecessary information included in each video which make them long and boring number and length of videos in each week are too much while the practical information you get are not enough	1
the course provides clear direction and content on machine learning andrew conveys his ideas clearly and conducts the lecture in a good pacein addition the programming assignment provides good platform for us to practice what we have learnt from the lectures and to understand in practice the actual way of performing machine learningshort write up after each lecture is also much appreciated as it is a good and quick way to skim for necessary information when we are doing revision	4
clear and concise course	4
the lectures and swirl exercises are extremely easy to understand and follow but then the assignments are incredibly complicated and difficult the assignments ask for techniques that arent focused on or even covered in the lectures the tips offered by al warren in the discussion forum make the assignments possible to do since the tips are so critical to understanding and completing the assignments i think al warrens tips should be incorporated as part of the core course this course needs more time to be covered in depth  its a lot of ground to cover in just one month	0
it would be better if the course could offer more real life stories overall it is very inspiring	3

the discovery of david christians approach first by reading his maps of time and listening to some of his presentations online then by attending this course was an eyeopener to me i now try to explain the importance of the subject to as many people as i can not only adults or university students but midlevel students as well deserve to be exposed to the view of big history it changes ones perceptions of the past and enhances ones apprehensions of the future	4

best course in machine learning	4
happy to have found this course very informative	4
all people that wants to work in the us and is them first time need this course for practice english and learning about the process	4
the content of this course is excellent and ive learned a tremendous amount it would be a star course if that were the only criterionive become discouraged about the lack of rigor in the quizzes a standard practice for students in online courses if a quiz can be taken more than once is to take the quiz before studying the material this is a researchsupported study technique it focuses attention on key points in listeningreading im finding that the questions virtually give away the answers on my trialrun attempt before the videos i score close to or above the passing level because the multipleresponse answers are immediately visible a student could boost into the generous passing range on a second attempt just by seeing which boxes should have been checked or left unchecked i can usually achieve a score of  on three attempts before seeing any of the materialquestions could be more difficult by requiring more discerning application of the principles or by requiring true recall typing in rather than choosing the information in a multiple choice format there are dozens of ways to make questions a more rigorous and authentic assessment of student knowledge im sure you know and practice many of them in your facetoface classesthe option to repeat the quiz fails as an assessment because the questions are repeated identically even after the incorrect answers have been indicated  and in the multiple response questions this means that the correct answers have also been shown a person with no knowledge of the subject matter should be able to score  in a maximum of  attempts at the quiz just by trying each answer on each question thus the quiz is not any kind of assessment of actual knowledgethe assignments do require a demonstration of some ability but the grading scheme is sufficiently generous that a person who follows the instructions minimally will earn enough points so that in conjunction with quiz scores they pass and receive the certificate for the coursethis certificate program has high visibility in social media right now it would be a shame for the certificate to devalue rapidly when it becomes clear to employers and students that the certificate does not in fact indicate that a person has passed any minimal threshold of knowledge or skillit may be that the capstone project is graded quite rigorously so that any slackers from the previous classes will not earn the certificate  but thats a bit devious too	2
excellent course engaging a great way to learn python for those with little or no prior programming experience	4
teacher is fun and very clear teaches each and every word he writes	4
i enjoyed the class even though i felt it was a little over my head i learned a lot about the processes involved in doing this work	4

i like the teachers	4
nice brief introduction to mobile communication technologies	4
this course is easy to follow with a mix of resources making it engaging and inspiring i found the rapid pfa model to be an effective and proactive response to dealing with adverse situations it is very interesting to learn that this technique is found to be more effective than that of a series of post disaster psychotherapy so this can be taught to non medical aid workers and possibly alleviate some of the sometimes unnecessary strain on medical andor psychological resources it is all about going back to basics a need to reach out to others and a need to communicate and not suffer in silence	4
love this course	3
generally quite good in reviewing a multitude of aspects i did miss not having my responses evaluated even though i decided just to audit this course on almost all occassions others courses let you evaluate your learning as you go so this was disappointingi did purchase blooms book which i find easy to read and very complimentary to the course	3
this is an excellent history class on the recent housing collapse and financial crisis but it also does a masterful job of succinctly and clearly explainingillustrating the underlying causes of the entire global financial crisis as well as to the individual events throughout the multi year ordeal slides are very well put together with some very informative data id suggest this class to anyone who wants an updated understanding of global finance and modern day banking	4

having taken a lot of computer science courses by coursera i can confirm this course is in the top two most valuable investments of my timemoney along with martin oderskys scala coursei am an experienced java backend developer but have never worked in the frontend and yet i found the material in this course very easy to follow this is up to the teachers talent to present the basic concepts with exceptional clarity in the correct order and depth now i am waiting for yaakov to give a course about angular if you are a backend developer and want to do your first step to frontend development this course is a must	4
great instructors wish the problem sets were tougher and required more deeper thinking and choice of techniques to apply	4

good teaching style	4
i enjoyed the course very much but found the assignment very frustrating despite trying numerous ways with the data provided i did not get the same map coverage as the instructor and there was no explanation as to what i might have done differently despite a number of people asking the same question in the forums it was still possible to get full marks without but it would have been more satisfying to get the same answer	3
absolutely awesome course it is both foundational and applicable in business and personal life	4
i have learned a lot of things from this course thanks	4
no factual tools 	0
it requires more effort on undestanding the algorithms involved in the problems rather than paralelism and its techniques instead of  weeks it would benefit of an additional week  for those who take the course after the regular work hours at their job so  weeks would be more adequate	3
dougs lectures were great hes entertaining and he gets the concepts across very clearly i struggled with the course itself however the participation rate was low and the ios app was so buggy i deleted it the web interface was better but still difficult to work withthe ios app would forget i was in the course and lose my assignments it also wouldnt let me open the discussion forums with the technical problems and low participation i can only give the course 	2
i highly recommend this course if you have enthusiasm for structural geology and have taken introlevel geology courses the resources available are current the class is helpful for earth science educators as it reviews the new teaching standards and the lectures are specific to the research done by the amnh scientists leading the course i especially enjoyed the field assignment and reviewing others from around the world a great course i just wish it would have been longer	4

i really liked this coursethe course comprises of lectures which are clear and are rich in examples and of practical assignments which you do in rthe practical tasks is where the course shines  everything is explained very clearly there is a lot of content and the course works with databases that are huge thousands of cases and hundreds of variables and have some of the more common problems eg missing data i have little to no prior programming experience just for the recordmind you this is an introductory course as the name states so dont expect to be a master of r or data handling after finishing it but i feel i learned a lot here	4

this is probably my fourth course at coursera and the first one i could complete properly i have had to leave the rest because of the time and effort they asked for and for a working professional its just that much harder to give in so many hourswith this course i feel at ease watching the lectures and felt the tension melt away rather than having an add on pressure the best part is that i finished this course within  weeks rather than the stipulated  weekswhich shows how good dr raj is kudos to himthe only thing i felt missing was a sense of feedback from the professors like in a real classroom when people indulge themselves in courses involving such vigour and enthusiasm they expect to find a feedback from the professor as well maybe a sense of real time involvement but then again ill congratulate dr raj and the team at isb for making such a brilliant course i have already made many of my friends sign up for thischeers	3
really great things taught in this course are useful	4

fantastic course with lots of material and ideas to learn more effectively barbara is a great talker and the videos are built up with great points at a good pace especially interesting is all the extra material that is recommended and all the interviews	4
very very good needs some clean up in the powerpoints and perhaps a bit more elaboration with some concepts the quizzes were a bit tricky where some of the questions hinged on a single word or phrase in the lecture	3
i really had good time learning this course and this course instructor charles severance gave amazing details and intro towards programming many lecturers just go with direct definitions and concepts present in some textbook but dont go with simplicity many new students need something that is simple and clear so i think sir charles is best in doing that and hes my favourite lecturer now if the courses are this fun and interesting i wouldnt mind paying for it	4
one of the best courses available	4
for a survey course this module does a fantastic job of presenting the various struggles and discourses in the muslim world as well as contextualizing its inherent problems both historically and within presentday it does so objectively without sacrificing important reflection in the name of political correctness i recommend this course as a jumpoff point for anyone who wants to better understand this topic on an introductory level or would like to later pursue independent study into more complex or narrow topics thank you professor afsah	4

interesting subject  basic idea to have a dog defined for the exercises is nice but wo dog hard to benefit a bit too much talking in front of a wall  could benefit from more illustrative material graphs  videos  pictures why not show examples of dogs doing the games that would be great for people who do not yet own a dog i was hoping to get some insight into problematic dog behaviour but maybe that was wrong expectation	2

this is just what it says it isan intro to guitar enjoy	3
truly excellent course jon stewart is a superb instructor	4
the course is a great introduction to video game development using unity dhighly recommendable for those who love videogames and want to create their own	4
this course is a perfect one for people who are beginning to take their first steps in the world of python and programming in general all the lectures assignments and the course materials offer quite good insight to basic and fundamental programming conceptsand considering the syntactical ease of python it makes programming easy to learn and understand removing the extra clutter found in the more traditional languages like cc or javaand finally the instructor prof charles severance who is more affectionately called dr chuck just mixes fun and learning to create quite an exciting and memorable teaching environmentbut while all of this good i felt that this course lacked the bite for a more advanced learner or someone who has spent sometime in the world of programming the complexity of the quizzes or the assignments are at beginner level best for complete beginnersbut like i mentioned earlier it is very easy to rush the whole course in a couple of days time or at most one week for an advanced learnerthis course lays the foundation for the more advanced courses in python technically it is the first part of the programming for everybody specialization which consists of  courses revolving around the world of pythonso my final advice to all beginners is to take their sweet time understanding and grasping these fundamental concepts these form the foundation stone for any programming language as well as computer science world dont worry about the assignments you will get more than ample time to complete them and succeed in themplus i feel that you will also enjoy some of the bonus interviews they could be quite motivating or thoughtprovokingand for advanced beginners you can rush through this course and brush up on some basic concepts to move into more advanced courses which will not only be a lot more challenging and catering more advanced and diverse concepts and topicsand in my opinion this specialization package could be at this current moment the best possible experience when compared to learning the basics of python online and could be the closest thing to a facetoface learning experience	4
great class	4

the vast majority of reviews for this course are glowing well donecoming from a non medical background i found this course very challenging i hardly used any of the suggested readings or references as i found them too technical i had to start at a more basic high school level and work my way up after many hours of work many failed first attempts and countless hours of eating comfort food i eventually reached week  did i feel ready for the final exams i suppose it doesnt matter because i did pass and received my certificate	2

the course is excellently taught by david and i learned a lot worth doing as a precursor to any other longer web design course you might be considering as it gives you the basics my advice would be to take time with the lectures download a html text editor and pause frequently to check the code yourself and make sure it works it moves quickly but theres a lot to be learned from pausing and trying it yourself	3

the title is very misleading excel is an afterthought for this course instead there is a heavy focus on statistics the class claims to be for beginners but that is clearly not the case as it requires previous knowledge in inferential statistics and calculusexcel is hardly used and is certainly not the focus there are weeks where excel is not used at all there are no practice assignments only quizzesits clear that this course is outdated and poorly maintained as the videos refer to examples that are not included or content that was not presentedneedless to say i will not be taking any other courses in this specialization	0
since it is a very theoretical subject trying to explain it without proofs and plenty of background is hard but i feel like most of the course is just to memorize formulas without much explanation where they come from a few examples are computing the expectation and mean of the average distribution and computing confidence intervals	2
tough course but at least i have the impression that i know wind energy better	4
lots of information loved it	4
great class and something valuable to all people very interesting and i highly recommend it	4

this course is one the best course on coursera andrew did a really great job	4
great course	3
very well designed and delivered course great fundamentals and fresh application exercises valued the realistic briefs the creative practice and feedback givingreceiving in the course heartily recommend	4
this course is very bad i would like to say this course sucks compared with my sql course no matter how it is structured or how the instructor conducted the course the instructor is very boring and does not explain very clearly even when i start he does not clearly clarify how to start to use r he was just talking about what the powerpoint shows i will absolutely not recommend this course if you are beginners  stari will give a little credit to swirl a practical tool provided by this course to learn r by yourself thought the instruction of the r program itself but for the later part of swirl its confusing sometimes however i learnt much more from swirl rather than from the instructor i cant understand what he is talking about but you have to make it clear thru using swirl he said the swirl is an optional part but he does not realized what he shows is much worse than swirl  starsoverall i dont recommend this anyone especially if you are beginners	1
a very useful course and not just for psychologists i have a mother that has memory problems and this course helped me identify her illness and help her in any way i canalso as a movie fanatic it was so much easier to understand the complex ways our mind works through all the great movies our instructor used thank you so much for this course	4

simple and clear way to approach food but it would be great if we could add more nutritional science and physiology based info	3
the lecture make me understand more about my puppy thank you	3
would give this course  stars to be honest its just that the lecture slides are not informative enough only course outlines are there  look like they werent made seriously	3
the professor speaks very clear and easy to listen	4
what this course can improve is it should adopt the habit of thinking more instead of writing because in the week  the quiz is much more difficult than all the exercises we have done in previous weeks and we dont have the guide step by step like previous weeks i do know we have a week  quiz guide however when you write queries sometimes you do think your logic is right and query is right why cant i get the same answer with the choicesand when i finish the quiz and look back to the answer i even cant find the logic difference between answers and mine but the reality is i cant get the correct result there is only one diff i have found in one specific question that is i didnt use the same format to define one constraint but i do think my way is also fine and i also get an answer i think is totally correct from the logicso i do suggest the answers should not be single sometimes you should consider some specific formats or situation when students write their own queries dont give simple answer give the reason why you are correct	3
really helpful lovely course that you can do in your own time some very good tips and methods of how to use time more effectively in learning new things	4

loved this course as well as part  loved the instructors loved the way they presented the material thats how its done thank you soooooo very much for taking the time to make a fantastic course with the students in mind	4
compared to other courses in the creative writing specialization i felt that this one needs some improvement the video lectures just didnt have enough meat to them for example in other courses in the specialization there will be links to optional readings or videos leading to a deeper understanding of the concepts some readings for example would be welcome to give example of great or even not so great characterization	2
this is a best course for the beginners in the communication	4
it was a wonderful and life changing experience for me gratitude to dr valerie gauthier and the team thanks	4
this course gave me a basic academic knowledge of my favourite subject philosophy	4

this course is very helpful not only for the people that lives in developing country but also for the people as me that often works as expert in developing country one of the most common mistake is the temptation to use the same approach or tech used in your own country forgetting the local situation or habits that can strongly influence the final results i strongly recommend this course to all the guys that work for international cooperation	4
such an amazing course id recommend it for anyone interested in machine learning and wants a more indepth introduction to the field of neural networks	4
great course well structured easy to follow and to understand please offer more about applied neuromarketing like this	4
nice one	4
really enjoying the pace of this course the video sections are easily digestible i like the assignments and my classmates and i are learning to critique it would be nice if the instructors could do some critique for the students who are paying for the full program including the capstone project at the end	4
it is perfect for beginners but if youre an experienced writer you might be looking for something a little more challenging	2
there could be more assignments maybe more complex or with different outputs to fix the knowledge of the video lectures	4
very informative course	4
got many good ideas and confirmation of some things i am doing right already thjank you very much for teaching how to learn	4
overall this class was a good starting point for basics of finance but coming from an ivy league school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism especially if yale university expects people to pay for the class and their accreditationthe instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to but doesnt detract from the materialthe tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choices are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to questionmost of the videos are cobbled together excerpts from lectures the professor previously gave as such they cut out randomly have issues with the sound volume and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later but never does not the biggest problem once you get used to it because the course is an overview but its still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses availablethe instructor is clearly very procapitalism which is a mixed bag on one hand hes very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information on the other hand hes also very clearly biased bordering on utopic about the benefits of capitalism and glossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance to be clear this criticism is not of the professor or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed but merely that imho the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspectsramifications of unfettered capitalism especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the  recessionall that being said i learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and informative while i have a prior basis in the material that helped i learned a lot of new things and still came away with a better understanding of finance and the international financial system i would recommend anyone who wants to expand or create a knowledge basis in finance and financial institutions take this course	2
very very very easy	2
i am recommending this course to everyone i know thank you so much you helped me on many levels	4

excellent course for brushing the fundamentals the assignments also shows how the fundamentals are related to the big scheme of things	3

outstanding introduction to innovation management with relevant content ranging from the basic concepts of innovation and creativity to teams and network dynamics	4
the course is clear and wellpaced for someone who is beginner like me the instructor was great even if youve worked with earlier versions of html this is a good update to html and how to code cleanly with good syntax the coding along lessons are both fun and challenging so download sublime or a text editor right away and try things out in your first lesson if you want to get the most out of it overall this was a really good course i am excited to continue taking the rest of the web design certificate 	4
a good course with thorough knowledge of the basic terminology required for trading	4
im torn about this course the instructors approach and enthusiasm are great and the content seems fine but with no direct access to the instructor interactions come from discussion forums and peer reviewed assignments the discussion forums were lifeless with virtually no staff participation throughout the week course there was one discussion thread with staff participation legitimate questions from students about content errors or technical problems went unacknowledged peer review is an understandable part of this course but it has limited utility as the only feedback mechanism in a course populated by beginnersthis course is still quite new i believe it can and will be much better if the pool of students grows and there is more staff participation its still a worthwhile course as is but a tougher sell than earlier courses in this sequence	2
interesting course however more examples could be included	2
it was really informativebut need more examples and more pratical view	3
very good instruction and i really liked that i can start and stop everything on my schedule also it helps when you miss something and you can just restart or go back to it i also liked the discussion at the end with the project managers	4

great concise course with some very solid and wellfounded recommendations on how to improve your studying and acquisition of new subjects also great advice on testtaking techniquesthe introduction to memory techniques is very light but it really is a really rich and detailed subject in itself so its understandable that they didnt dive too deep some recommendations for additional learning for memory and advanced reading techniques would be a valuable addition to the course thoughoverall i highly recommend this course barbara is an excellent and very likable instructor and the lessons and learnings are wellsourced and easy to follow im already using the techniques and seeing good results	3
very good for dummies in finance or pure techies can add a bit more content in irr roi topics as we come across those quite often also these topics will help engineers with technical knowledge to understand the bigger picture of financial viability of the projects they handle	3

i have never studied such a good algorithms class starting from very basics the best thing which i like most was java implementations of every piece of algorithms of basic data structures all videos lectures have detailed explanation of topics just a suggestion that  time and space complexity explanations could have been in more detailed so as to understand easily by a novice although the programming quiz questions were difficult they require every chunk of knowledge you have just studied also adding interview questions related to chapter with hints after your trial and mcqs after every small lectures were charm to the course i am sincerely looking forward to enroll in other courdses as well thank you so much coursera team robert and kevin	3

this nice course helped me to understand the rock music in more systematical organized way the lecturer was very good the visual part of the videos helped a lot and supplementary materials too the only disappointment i had with sometimes too specific questions in the quizzes which meant that i must stop the video all the time to make an enormously specific notes and this kinda spoils the integrity here nevertheless it was a great experience and i definitely plan to go to the part  in the next year	4

first of all the instructor is very responsible keep updating information on the forum and course material the course is a decent level of basic plotting technique review should be in more detail compared with the first course of this specialization this second course is much less challenging require less effort to accomplish the first course is the one attract me of this specialization the second one somehow is a bit disappointing especially compared with plotting skill of r in another data science specialization which is even an elementary level course this course cannot be labeled as intermediate levelanother problem with this course is the peer review the grading policy should be changed to punish irresponsible reviewers no useful feedback got what kind of responsible one provide feedback in two words where require to answer three questions week  assignment to review	2
very good coursefull of useful details only thing is at times mr landers was uncomfortable in front of the camera and that made me uncomfortable too other than that it was pretty goodthank youteo	3

great course i have enjoyed every week i will miss you yaakov regards and good luck	4
great but too short i realize that it is hard to know where to start the course from but it is true that the introductory course for the genomics specialization has a lot of over lapping material i suggest getting rid of your intro material and go just a little farther in depththanks mc	4
this course is extension to python for everybody and is as good as the first course the chapters in both courses are well aligned and flow very well from the beginning to end	4
absolutely wonderful the universidad de columbia and especially professor jeffrey sachs made an amazing revision of the history the data and the concepts of sustainable development as the biggest ideas the biggest challenge of our time interesting compressible interactive this was a great experience for me and im sure for everyone	4
it was very helpful course	4
clear progressions and simple explanations	4

its really great too see the history of computers internet etcfantastic to watch all the interviews with the people who created internet first web server wwwi really enjoy it and it feels like exciting journey back in timethank you dr chuck	4
i do not recommend this course it did not fill my expectations i am not able to create application for mobile phone after finishing itfirst  modules were somehow useful but since module  onward it is just waste of time i did not learn anything useful i did not learn how to code advices for sources were very shallow and it was not shown how to work with them i could gain same information with basic search engine requestthe teacher is nice and willing to give information to students but unfortunatelly he did not prepare for recordings of videos his speeches lacked structure and focus very often he was lost in talking and he often reexplained in detail staff which was already explained in previous videos this caused that videos were too long considering the amount of knowledge that was provided to students and watching them was waste of timethe course was shallow information did not go deep students participation was not supported nor required after  module	0
after completing this course i have gained valuable insights in real life situations and be more aware in my own industry this course would not only allow you to see the playing field but also to make carefully calculated decisions towards the best possible outcomethe tests are difficult and some are rather tricky but hey the situations we encounter in real life are far worse than these	4
amazing course	4
by far to expansive for what you get anyway thanks for the hint about swirl	0

this lecture was amazingthe practical was also very helpful	4
very informative and moderately challenging final project	4
good course and good introduction to meteorjs i knocked it down one star because the assignments are not as effective as they could be weeks  are short easy quizzes only in week  is there a programming assignment and it is a doozy more than  hours for menothing like the  minutes it claims however i will point out it was a good assignment and i learned a loti think if the assignments were structured more like the u of hong kong web development courses this would be a five star course	3
the video quality was so bad can not see the code clearly please update the better video	2
great class i like the pace and i am learning a lot of useful ways to use python	3
amazing teachers valuable information and topquality materials thanks so much for making this course  i gained a lot from it especially from giving and receiving feedback from fellow students the only thing i didnt enjoy much are some questions in the tests because sometimes they seem a bit irrelevant i would recommend making the tests a bit more to the point and reducing the amount of questions especially the one in the final tests like who inspired the angel and devil debate  thanks for your work	4
extremely informative invaluable lessons	4
excellent example of what future education should look like	4
tremendous thats a real teaching	4

great informative class but way too many quizzes	3
brando did a great job in presenting a structure for plot i think his insights are valuable and he did tried to offer practical guidelines writers can usewhat i didnt like was the reviewing of the assignments some times i didnt receive valuable feedback  the same sentence copypasted in every section and someone failed me for not understanding my intentions because he was not an english speakeraway from that i really liked brando his style and his involvement	3

very useful course	4
interesting but didnt explain in depth many of the topics	2
excellent material very well explained useful and practical approach	4
i am very happy that i completed this module there are few teachers who taught about how to learn and how our brain is actually doing while we are learning new stuff by knowing more about the activities happening in the brain helps me to control my learning and sometime use some tricks to convince my brain go deeper or to train my braini cant wait to apply the methods taught in this module on other subjects	4

very helpfulclear and have a lot of interesting examples for us to understand	4
great course for new learner its easy and interesting course	4
it was pretty intuitive and easy to follow the first couple of weeks but then the assumed knowledge of beta and gamma distributions and their frequentist usage stood in the way of me fully grasping the bayesian part of it in the end i just copied the examples from the lectures and passed the tests  without really getting it	2
amazing and very entertaining introduction to machine learning it has interesting labs and the theory is explained clearly	4
thank you son muchi really like the courseit help me in my job 	4
fascinating course loved it	4
was tough but thoroughly had fun completing it its a cleverly designed course	4
great general overview of nutrition and cooking for those who are just starting to work on balanced menus for home or group settings	4
interesting subject the presenter is hard to listen to though	1
i was really hoping to complete the data science specialization but i have found the first couple of courses to be not very cohesive this course in particular was ok but lectures and application projects and assignments had such a wide gap between them i found that i was mostly teaching myself	1
the subject is interesting and the instructors both seemed very competentstill i wish the course had been better prepared as there were lots of sounds defects you had to adjust the volume during each video which is tiresome in the same idea the questions during the course would pop up in midsentence sometimes with too much anticipation with the subject at hand last the questions in the assignments were sometimes not so much to check your understanding but your memory about a small detail like a  in a study that is already obsolete by the time we learn itall in all a great course with great instructors but still room for improvement as a mooc	2
one of the best courses ive ever seen	4
i learned a lot from this class but i had a difficult time with some of the multiple choice quizzes which i think could be improved i felt that the additional materials pdf readings could have done a better job explaining concepts like risk ratios rate ratios and odds ratios among others i hope the teachers of the class consider revising and improving the lectures and readings for clarity	3
great course for learning the basics of calc thanks prof jim fowler d	4
well done focuses mainly on videos to teach the content with an assignment at the end of the week that uses everything you learned i would rate  stars if it had more quizzes or exercises to do before the weeks assignment at any rate you learn a lot about html css and js and its a worthy class in this specialization	3
exceptional format and delivery keeps us engaged throughout	4
interesting and simple explained	3
excellent teachers thanks to you alldr stephen mayfield inspire respect for the subject congrats	4
peer grading worked well good explanations	3
i thoroughly enjoyed this course and would like to see more course offerings from dr boyd	4
this a decent course perhaps something i should go back through and do again	2
very interesting and clear with good humor 	4
content of the course is very good useful and interesting i greatly appreciate the knowledge delivered but assignments could improveall module assignments seems mostly focalize on using microstrategy tool in assignments i would like to see more exercises so that students learn through practice of business cases for example i prefer the way modules are organized in courses  and  concepts with examples practice exercise then assignment through similar exercise  a quizin last assignment there was no suggested solutions for the last question i think this is missing for a good understanding	2
great course the exercises are more interesting than in previous editionvery good for beginners	4
i learned many of practical materials this was the best online course ive ever taken thank you	4
even if youve never had a lifelong fascination with natural history like i did this course should be fascinating and educational enough to draw you in scott persons is an amazing teacher clear concise knowledgeable and passionate enough that you will never feel lost learn a great deal and yet never feel bored philip currie is also very informative highly recommended for anyone with even a modicum of interest in dinosaurs	4

i was a really good course however some of the assignment tasks could have been a bit more complex for example week 	3
excelente curso muy interesante cada uno de sus contenidos grs	4
the course is great but this is a little work as colleen says our hands didnt get dirty a lot but i really like it a lot	3
very useful	3
great introductory course i am learning a lot about genetics	4
thank you for a very practical yet also quite conceptual coverage of some big important concepts in machine learning really excellent course	4
teaches the basics of buck and boost converters switching voltage regulators basics like how the switching dutycycle determines the output voltage and how the essential components affect ripple in the voltage and currentthe homework assignments are challenging and meaningful without being enormous undertakingsassumes freshman or sophomorelevel electronics engineering knowledge or maybe the first chapter of the art of electronics assumes familiarity with the basic concepts of calculus what derivatives and integrals are homework requires some algebra algebraic manipulation but no difficult calculus sort of algebra homework does require thinking outside of the box a bit the solutions to some problems are not completely obvious from the lectures	4
for me as mechanical engineer it was very useful to see how this course that i had some time ago in serbia where i live and work is presented at an top us and world universitythank you so much dr whiteman georgia tech and coursera for a really nice experiencedrazen kosutic basc in me	4

it really great	4
great course	4
this course on business writing has been extremely useful to me there were parts which were more general and simple and others which gave specific advice but all of them taught something new i would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to get his message across effectively and efficiently at work and dont worry if youre not a native english speaker because im a spanish student and had no problem at all i am going to take the next course of the specialization programme without a doubt	4
very informative and interesting	4
just terrific i am loving this course and its helping me to clarify some of my doubts	4
it was helpful but too technical for nonbusiness person to learn about basic project management it also would have been easier to understand if the information presented were to be broken down into smaller sizes	1
it was such an awesome specialization it really opened my eyes to a lot of python d	4
very nice course as a beginner on the way to web designing	4
only skims the surface of big data even for an introduction course	2
really nice introduction to machine learningit contains essential contents which is not difficult and also not easy	4
outstanding course for those who dont fear the important questions such as what makes a good life dont miss it	4
too long videos you should make more short videos instead of one boring long video you speak too slow and that makes a  minutes video turns into  minutes video	0
the course was very simplistic and more targeted to a new manager or a student who has never taken a conflict resolution course i only found the interviews with karen and joseph to be of interest the instructors teaching style is too monotone  i didnt get a sense of her real world experience coming through no sense of her brand	2
i thoroughly enjoyed the coursei would love it to also provide some data with objectives  case studies for us to tackle the entire ml problem by ourselves to really cement the understanding	4
i have been taking online for almost  years now and i can openly say that this course is a very handson structured module that i can recommend for beginners	4
excellent lectures personal transformation observed while watching	4
its a good course for beginners	2
overall a decent course to audit but i think it was almost too repetitive and lacked a lot of substance it would have been nice to really focus on great content types versus share share share	2

i really loved the course and learned a lot thank you	4
course content has been presented in an excellent manner	4
pretty solid	4
the most useful course on coursera	4
a nice introductory overlook to scm intricacies very complete with a lot of useful examples and explaining a lot of basic concepts	4
not very helpful in the homework i spent more time wrestling with commands in r than actually gaining an understanding of the subject matteralso i really didnt need so many subject matter examples about the professors babys pooping habits and my family is dutch with all the offensive humor that comes with it so its not just a matter of the sense of humor not translatingim retaking statistics with calculus online at my local state university and frankly i cant notice any benefit from taking this course first my current online statistics with calculus course is rewarding and i feel like im truly gaining mastery of the topics whereas in the basic statistics course i was flounderingthe graphics in the way the lessons are presented are well done but i would have been just fine with fewer graphics if it meant more workedthrough examples	1
good course	4
good but lengthy videos	4
very useful knowledge enhance my working task the content is delivered well with suitable material great experiences for me to develop myself	4
i was really interested in this course and i think the information is useful but i find it boring it didnt get my attention	1
fantastic course and a wonderful teacher really grown in my programming ability	4
great course and material it kept me disciplined and following up on class requirements to ensure learning	3
so so interesting	4
very good instructor and good structure and pace to the class would have liked more reallife examples and would have liked peer review questions that required more thought and strategy behind them which channel do you like more isnt really that intriguing a question instead a different question could have been how might you leverage each channel for different purposes	3
great course with cool knowledge	4
very interesting course that can help improve how you learn i definitely recommend reading the optional text a mind for numbers by barbara oakley	4
yakov is the perhaps the best instructor ive ever had across ivy league universities and private postgraduate institutions	4
excellent informative and fun introduction to machine learning the programming assignments are carefully designed to incrementally ramp up the difficulty and the nuances of octavematlab relevant to the assignments are explained beforehand the quality is truly impressive although i wish there was a little more mathematical depth to some of the lectures many derivations and details of linear algebra were kind of glossed over but i understand that theres a lot to cover in a fairly short period of time so it is understandable and most people probably dont mind it anyway this is one of the few courses that really keeps me motivated to complete all assignments thank you prof ng	4
very rich content	4
most amazing course in terms of clarity practicality and delivery a big salute to professor ng whos made my life that much more interesting by opening my eyes to the beauty and potential of this topic	4
concise and practical	4
very good teachersinstructors	4
very well structured course that takes you step by step through the concepts and gives you a clear understanding of the inner functioning of the code your write i am sure this insight will be very useful when one gets to writing live code and this knowledge will help write more optimal code	4
this is an interesting course for me who have never learned code	4
i have finished part one of this course and i am currently completing part two i have really enjoyed this detail and humane look on history so far the course instructor dr zelikow is very thorough and competent and has great perspectives and interpretations on different events that shaped the history of the world	4
liked the course and the lady teaching  very pleasant	4
very good and resumed analysis of activerecord and actionpack	4
very good clear and easy to learn more practices can be added to the course	4
exciting presentation excellent portrial of the periodic changes in thinking of tj with his rise fall and revival while a conroversial thinker he truly was a renaissance men that will inspire future generations america would not be exceptional nor even a free country empowed by the people	4
be aware that the beginning overview lectures of this course are radically different than the detailed lectures that come laterthe beginning of this course should be sent to anyone that ever tells you that evolution is not a thing dafter that be prepared to do a lot of listening to big a little a and minutia about how genetics really worksthis is a really good course not perfect but really good one star is removed because i think i would have preferred a bit more development and overview of the bigger picture i fell asleep at times i sometimes lost the concepts that i was interested in learning through the barrage of details but for someone who is very seriously studying the subject then it would be  starsprof noor is a good speaker clear and has a nice voice and personality	3
this course is a sufficient way to improve your capacity of being yourself by improving your relationships with othes and let possitive and negative emotions toobe embodied and not just abandon themthis course will help you totaly find yourown way to cope with stress and anxiety and will give you advice on how your immune and your cardiovascular system will flourish by experiencing emotions as they come to us	4
very easy to learn	3
professor was passionate	4

poor video and audio quality not worth the price	1
seemed like a ghost course issues reported with the swirl package duplicate questions in the final assessment where is the instructor 	1
highly recommand it to do it if you love canada and its mountains	3
a great course beginner friendly	4
i am disappointed in the quality of the lectures in this course theyre too summarized  too quick and they lack the thoroughness required to accurately convey the intuition the student needs to comprehend the lessons taught when i have to spend a significant number of hours watching lectures on youtube to compensate for the poor quality lectures offered in understand financial markets i am left wondering why i enrolled in the specialization i think coursera needs to have a conversation with the professors at geneva university about the need for prerequisites before allowing students to enroll in this specialization	0
this course rocksyou are thought many different learning techniques and get to know how your brain works in a simple way without too much background information its just the right amount of input to get a feeling for it you can apply this knowledge to every kind of subject the short videos are easy to persuade yourself to get started once started you want to see another one the lecturers have prepared their videos perfectly and after some videos you feel a little bit connected to them they are able to do the seemingly unmakeable keep you motivated if i feel myself unmotivated to study for my exam first of all i watch one of these video sequences and promptly i am motivated againthanks a lot for putting this course onlinei love your work	4
course content is ok but some lectors are really boring in explaining mathematical detailstasks are pretty easy and this is from algorithmic perspective because from programming there are almost nothing to doand overall it feels that there are not so much info as for  weeks course if it would cost lest than it would be ok but for  ive expected more	2
a good class to review the basics with just the right amount of the key information	3
the best course of this segment	4
i have made a great progressthanks a lot	4
to much theory	1
great course	4
really helpful for learner and to begin the journey in html 	4
such a nice course a lot of algorithms and they are so well explained and what is the most important it is demonstrated how they work besides that share coursera is awesome with all of its lecture notes these knowledges helped me to do my master thesis work thank you so much	4
its an excellent informattive  skillfull course	4
great course for branding insights	3
it a fine beginners course i liked the handson approach using sframes	3
extremely interesting subject the exposition is for the most part remarkably clear though it amounts to a necessarily quick introduction to the vast variety of tecniques and tools the student is supposed to conduct a lot of practice as selfstudy and experimenting giving  stars out of  instead of full marks only because i feel this course might work better in an extended format going more indepth on real cases and guiding the students through the hurdles and subtleties of such analyses	3
wow im on week one but already so excited to watch all the lectures and learn everything thank you very much for such interesting and intelligible material	4
fantastic course would thoroughly recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in machine learning	4
very good course i am enjoying it immensely	4
charles makes it so easygreat course	4
good course but i hope if there are readings after each video to improve the understanding of information with more simplifying the content of ethics lesson	3
very helpful for beginnersinstructor teaches every details you need to start as a web developer	4
the section about betabinomial conjugate is taught very fast and unless the student is quite familiar with beta and gamma distributions it makes it very difficult to follow the course	3
dr boyd is very engaging and his graphics are helpful to guide you along i also love the variety of guest speakers that appear in his class	3
very well structured and executed course	4
great course  	3

great course i would like more on how to use hootsuite and klout also which one is better i am finding them a challenge to use i like to search for my own content as i find the suggested content boringand often not relevant to what i am looking for i cant understand why i cannot cut and past links so like i said a primer on how to use these sites would be good	3
this course makes it very easy to understand and learn the algorithms used in machine learning andrew sir explains everything with really good examples a must take course for the people who love data science	4
this course is extraordinary the  professors who present the material are both experts in their respective areas holocaust history and comparative literature they present the material not only from a profound academic understanding they are both children of the holocaust and so they convey the material in a deeply personal and human way as well using the holocaust as a momentous backdrop the professors challenge the students to examine important philosophical questions throughout the course the books and movies discussed are absolutely wonderful finally the relationship between murray and peter that of deep trust and respect contrast so powerfully with the inhumanity of the topic they present this is one of the best courses that i have ever taken in my life including my time during college	4
very insightful thanks	4
great class	4
great course	4
great ending to the three paleontology courses	4

good to know for every manager	4
this has to be the poorest educational experience ive ever had virtually nothing is explained the instructor says time  time again that shes not going to bother to explain in detail and that we should go out  explore all these free resources if we want to learn so why did i pay for this class honestly save your money this is nothing but a ripoff and i am shocked that an institution like u of m would allow such a sloppy lazy product to be out there under its brandto make matters worse we are instructed time  time again to go out onto the discussion board and ask for help when she doesnt want to bother explaining a concept everyone else taking this class is confused too  how could they possibly be of any help to me the staff who comes onto the boards are just about as rude  unhelpful as any ive ever seen they literally say well did you watch the lecture ummm yes i did  it directed me to come here for helpi feel duped this is a scam and i can only say i am sorry i paid my money for this if you really want to learn css get yourself a good book on the subject andor utilize the free material out on the internet this will absolutely waste hours of your time and way too much of your money for what they are providing	0
good training	4
a good course i learned a lot from the course very well explained	4
thank you this was a great short form course quickly got to what i needed	3
more assignments would help us more	3
the material is ok but the grading is terrible most of the grades are for peer reviews which depending on other students may never be completed particularly if your first try isnt perfect and you need to resubmit i would not pay for the course until i had passed peer review as odds are you never will	1
i would like to give this course worse than a  star the course explanations are very poor the explanations drag on and make no sense i had to go to outside sources to make sense of what the videos were discussing which i felt like defeats the purpose why am i paying for something when i have to use other sources to better explain i would never recommend this course to anyone listening to these teachers explain each subject poorly was killing me i like to learn through examples but what they provide just makes it more confusing and hard to follow each instructor got worse and worse the videos were so hard to watch and the accents made it even more worse i feel robbed from taking this course i should have asked for my refund within the first week but i felt since i was paying i would stick it out a little longer you will get a better explanation if you take each subject and youtube the videos on each subject very useless course hated every week of this course and i wouldnt dare to continue with the full specialization program its very sad to hear that this course gets recommended a lot but it missed its mark completely	0

the content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology but it is somewhat if not totally a false representation of interaction with the experts there is absolutely none some seems repetitive from course one	2

this course is outstanding it not only demystefied mindfulness but increased my own mindfulness even though i have benefited immensely from a vipassana course several months ago dr gotojones has navigated the controversial subject of mindfulness brilliantly by his own articulate manner of objectivity while tackling topics such as religion philosophy and commercialization head on without superimposing his own views leaving the ultimate choice of what concepts and beliefs one wants to retain modify or discard entirely to the student to that end his highly qualified i even say wise guests contributed significantly through their own views andor exercise guidance i hope many more will benefit from this course in future my best wishes to dr gotojones and a heartfelt thank you to hi and all his guests	4

im a statistician not a programmer there is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms when trying to fumble my way through the code i found on several occasions the code in the selfdirected lessons to be incomplete im referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there but were missing causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil i feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code similar to the st course rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming languageif you are a software designerengineer or programmer then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given there are other mistakes within the quizzes as well which make them near impossible to pass for example it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot on other occasions the question actually specifies to use the model from  whereas it actually wants you to use the model from  instead to get the correct answer this course needs to have better quality checks to ensure needlessly lost time is minimized	1
kind of helpful to illustrate the essentials of the global capital markets including equity debts foreign exchange and forward future contracts etc hope you may enjoy	3

i found this course very interesting and learned a lot	4
the course had many information provided and thanks for that but there are some things i disliked and i guess by fixing them the course would become much much better the information refers to the pmbok very often that is good as the pmbok worth must reading for any pm but it is a bit difficult to understand anything while a teacher just retranslates something from any book  especially not written by the one  with poor examples the much better way for lecturer is to explain it by oneself not by just staying there and repeating what i can read from my display i dislike fixating to any software maybe microsoft project is a good example but i am sure not the only one at first and as i am a mac person who has personal macbook and mac pro at work i am not going to use windows only for one application there are plenty of them these days the same or just similar the key is not a software itself but the methodology using in the one the methodology is worth understanding for sure grammar mistakes and misprints it looks a little strange that no one reviewed the materials neither on coursera i am sure it is not so easy to review every course nor the creators i am highly puzzled about how it could be possible if it is a free course for someone there are also many of those who are paying for the courses and the courses also represent the university how the university cannot find someone to check the mistakes before publications to be precise there are tiny mistakes related to headers and graphics which make the materials looks untidy materials production is very poor in details even for the key ones typography colours thickness of the fonts and lines there are no contrasts no highlighting  that looks as a draft not as a final course worth spending the time effort and money if there are no people available to help with producing the materials of a good quality you can ask people from trueowl inc the website is trueowlcom and the working email is  to help with it they  we as i am member of the team  are highly concerned about educational materials and motivated to enhance the quality of the materials even for free of chargeanyway i am glad i finished this course as it gave me understanding which way should i continue with diving deeper into the themethank you	2
brilliant teachers sharing really useful insight about the learning process and how to optimize it highly recommended tremendously resourceful	4

this course gives a very good overview of algorithms justifying each new data structure or technique by examining the performance and technical problems that it is trying to solve and explaining the meaning of the approach it is a good idea to do a good bit of coding on your own however as the assignments typically expect you to use the data structures explained in the lectures from a static library rather than handcoded	4

not up to the standard of the previous two courses the material was already covered in the first course  fundamentals of graphic design  and nothing new was brought to the table even the assignments were a rehash of the ones from the first course i realize the point of the lack of specific guidance was intended to encourage us to explore the making of multiple iterations of the images i just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy	1
we all hear about big data and its core role at information society this course helped me understand how we actually use big data to interact with people i also realised that we dont need to be part of a big company to work with big data there are tools available for every person some of them for free	3

great course to make yours donnations more efective	4
first of all thank you for the course as it enables students to get a bit more uptodate and knowledgeable in the topicon the other hand unfortunately its not worth ones time as it didnt deliver very good quality nor on its promise regarding the big pictureproseasy to understandselfpacedobjectivity and positive overall messageconsoverall quality and clarity of the lectures is not very good lectures are a bit hard to follow not because of the complexity of the topic but because of some controversial and outdated data and the speaking and presentation style of the lecturerassignments contain too many trivial questions but also some mistakes which makes some questions impossible to answer correctly based on the lectures or at allno staff engagement or feedback on the forums which is especially problematic regarding to aforementioned mistakesthe title and description of the course dont inform students that it is completely uscentric and mostly concentrating on petroleumoil so along with a lot of important topics the big picture is missing	1

i enjoyed some of this course content but mostly did not enjoy the course delivery the instructor is very warm and friendly but not well articulate also the way the course content is extremely segmented into short videos with  sec intros to each video is extremely distracting and interrupted my concentration i i felt the videos with tiffany were unnecessary and a waste of time also i felt there were not enough examples or really life examples especially later in the course when describing different types of date and analysis	1
easy to understand videos are fun to watch learning python was easy	4
great lectures great people who provide tutorials on the assignments and the assignments truly give the student a deeper understanding of the course material plus if i want to apply what i learned in the future i have the code already written from the course assignments	4

movies were very interesting and planning to watch all of them with new perspectivewish the summaries and important texts in the lecture was available as slides helping for quick review and recallthe same constant tone of voice made it difficult to keep awake and focus on the contentwished for more reading material each week rather than same book link	3
yes the teaching is fantastic and attractive and also the assignments are not difficult to master	4
great insights	4
i found this course useful and appropriate in the material offered and the assessed questions as an introduction and an update in cancer biology for cpd purposes it is rather disappointing that the final grade achieved is not printed on the certificate for a to join the course and not have the full information such as the hours involved and the final grade achieved makes it very disappointing not to reflect the effort i put in as well as tricky to include this course as part of a cpd program	2

lectures are nicely delivered but videos of lectures should be confined within  minutes and be cited data sources and how to we can see and obtain data aswell	4

i am an english language professor i took this course for funmy ba minor was in history and i am a curious personi love this course and dr chuck the way he explains things is in english i mean that the way he explains things makes sense to a nonliterate it person in addition the content is both interesting and informative the structure of the course is easy to follow i have taken a few courses where i was not sure what i was supposed to do next but not in this coursefrankly i prefer a course where i take quizzes projects can be educational and interesting and sometimes necessary to the course content but i am working  to  hours a week and dont always have time for courses with projectsand those are the courses i have not completed i liked just taking quizzes about the contentso far this has been the best course i have taken in coursera and i have already signed up for a second course with dr chuck and the university of michigan	4
excellent course and teacher congratulations	4
in general an excellent course taught by competent professors i believe that in the main this course does very well in achieving its objective of knowledge transfer however having experienced it there were parts where the professor was demonstrating a topic using a video presentation showing him operate a process or screen sequence on his computer these aspects like virtually all the material on this course are of a technical nature and contain many important details as such to help complete and reenforce their learning students require something like a sequence of slides that they can print out and retain for revision and future reference in certain parts the provision of the printable screenshots in the form of slides was absentan important theme of the course and data science in general is reproducible research what im arguing for here is reproducible learning materials covering a complete course not only parts of it admittedly it was only a very small proportion of the course that suffers from this defect but i would not like it to become the norm in the future as a suggestion it could be possible to author a lecture using html so as to combine the verbatum lecture text with every slidescreenshot image embedded in its right position within the lecturei notice coursera courses have also moved away from the weekly lists of individual lectures together with their links to txt mp etc files the new presentation keeps you submerged within the flow within each weeks series of lectures one has to click out in order to watch your progress and then reenter the lectures at a resumption point i prefer the previous navigation structure in order to access lectures and materials printed learning materials are also important for me in addition to the video lectures the latter are of course vital as the medium for the initial exposure of the material	3
excellent course material and professor 	4
very basic introduction to python	3
it is an introductory course so it does not include much about the subject	3
interesting and clear	2
great course	4
exercises were good but the actual teaching of technique felt somewhat lacking in a way the instructors actually cover a lot of ground over a short period of time but on the other hand there are certain areas that i wish they would have covered more in depth in order to be equipped to complete the homeworkfor example the week  hw on shipment status did not specify the criteria for earlylateontime so i ended up making a parameter for the user to vary it however parameters are not covered in this course also for the same homework there wasnt enough explanation of how to get weeks to be listed starting with a particular day which made it difficult to replicate exactly what the homework sample is supposed to look like	3
really enjoying this mooc so far	3
i believe the assessments focus on insignificant details mentioned in the presentations rather than the big ideas that i believed was the crux of the course	2
i didnt like the assignment it did not make me think of the taught theory or teach me any kind of practical skill however the rest of the course was good	3
very tough course mostly because of the amount of work expected learnt a lot but it wasnt fun and the course material needs work in my opinion	2
en excellent introduction to ux	4
very nice stuff	4
blew my mind  recomendado	4
this is probably the best ml course available online	4
good course for understanding how to create advanced level of charts	4
this course was amazing in many different ways i really learned a lot about how machine learning works at least for the algorithms covered in the course and im really keen to continue learning learning tools and methods anyone could just read about ml and algorithms but the way the course is focusing on exercises really helps assimilate the content a lot of effort goes into providing support to the students im very thankful to the staff who are very responsive on the forums they also provide a lot of test cases and other help to better understand how to complete the exercicesi recently left my job to focus on personal development and am doing a lot of online courses right now this course by far the best one i did so far im really glad i took the time to do it and looking forward to learning more on the topicthanks again	4

i have just completed this course this is my first attempt to understand buddhism and have approached this with all the biases inherent in having lived my whole life as a westerner who has spent very little time trying to understand mysticism or meditation the abstract concepts of buddhist thought stretched my mind greatly and at times i had to stop the video just to reflect on some concept so abstract i had to play segments of the video lecture over and over again dr wright seems to labor greatly on getting his explanations as plain and straightforward as he could he held my attention without gimmicks and if i didnt get the point the first time the video playback format made it possible for me to go over one point or another as i needed if you come with all the usual western bias and baggage toward eastern in this case buddhist concept and thought and would like to learn this is the place to start you wont be disappointed	4
the teacher spoke very clearly but the transcripts of each lecture should have included the pinyin transcriptions without themthey were no help	2

a good introductory course to gain an appreciation of some of the theory and techniques that goes into designing mechanical systems in our modern world real world cases are discussed and i have become aware of some of the failure mechanisms in airplanes and in the body skeleton so i am a bit more leary of taking airplane flights  and not jumping off high places while twirling you need to be familiar with basic theory of stress and strain before taking this course there is a series of courses available on coursea as prerequisite the way the quizzes are scheduled makes it advantageous to watch the videos early in the week and take the quiz as soon as possible since you get only one attempt every  hours enjoyed the course	3
the course is good way to start the data analytics everyone before venturing into data analytics with lot off doubts should attend this course and it will clear the doubtsthe teaching team should provide some downloadable slides of the text shown during the presentations coursera can recommend for slides similar to slides in entrepreneurship course provided by wharton online	3

as with all coursera courses there is no way to communicate with the tutors which is vey important in such a specialised course the course also requires finishing assignments while needed clarification and explanation is not always provided in the course videos in some assignment a required step was only explained in the following week centering variablesassignments review depend only on peer review when peers in most of the time dont read through assignment completely or open attachments leading to poor grading based on missed information that are actually attached in submissionsalso this course along with the rest of the courses in the data analysis and interpretation need some more focus on using sas and other data analysis tools and the way to present results in a more appealing way this could be given one extra lecture in each course	1

the lectures are too brief and do not go into details pertinent to the main theses of the course while it is evident that each of the roosevelts had a significant impact on their respective time in history saying that it was a rooseveltian century is going a bit too far nearly all the reforms that they initiated were countered by the end of the th century wagnerpyser glasssteagall were gutted by the end of the century and as for the un we all know how in ineffective that has been at protecting human rights the only thing that has lasted has been social security and that is under attack by a coopted ultraconservative congres	1
the material is so interesting that even though youre learning a lot it doesnt feel like hard work the only possible drawback is that it keeps referencing this citizen science a similar concept to crowd sourcing or opensource program called dognition dognitions this website that allows you to play games with your dog that test its cognition and uses the data from it to better understand how dogs think you dont need dognition to learn a lot and get a lot out of the course but if you dont have a dog to play with or feel like spring for the fee which again are highly optional and not needed to learn from this course you will miss out a bit but other than that its fascinating to learn about how dogs think and how thats unique among the animal kingdom	3
wowgreat course should add matlab and understanding of basic calculus to the prerequisites for those not familiar with those concepts the sidebar videos helped refresh concepts for those of us not in an engineering program but have had the material before cant wait for the next classes	4

this course is a discreditation to coursera and its low standards are appalling from a purely certificate based perspective the only requirement to complete the course are completely the quizzes they are short and can easily be googled or the slides can be downloaded and the answers simply crtlf for keyboards there is zero need to watch the lectures  at least for the first  weeksthe lectures are terrible themselves the english is beyond horrible and i dont understand the modern culture of having teachers teach in languages they cant speak it is purely reading off the slides in any case word for word i learned more about the basics in neuroscience in a  minutes lecture from a separate course computational neuroscience than the entire first week hereif you actually want to learn neuroscience check out hardvardxs intro course	0
very concise wellpresented course this was my second time taking it as a refresher prof caffo does a great job presenting the materials however prepare to be challenged	4

the course is super interesting however the lectures could be better explained and the material better organized i found myself constantly looking online for extra material to better understand the concepts also you can tell that the course is not anymore groomed and there are some mistakes in a quiz due to lack of care in any case the course is very recommendable to start with neural networks	2
great course great lessons and the invited speakers are a plus	4
this is a great seo course and i recommend it to every seo specialist 	4
very basic course with an extremely limited view on what makes a good plot	1
this was a very good experience for me the material was easily digestible but at the same time with at lot of depth i love how the professor invites you to dig into the more academic material without it being a prerequisite	4
this course is really great 	4
very straight forward course with easy to follow instructions the autograder takes some getting used to make sure there are no additional lines at the end of your code and make sure everything is precisely copied for your output	3

there are many tips that can be used right away in the professional environment	4
i really enjoyed it thankyou	3
maybe could be more in depth i really appreciated how passionate dr chuck is and how much he cares about his students even in online lectures thank you	3
an absolutely fantastic course very highly recommend it to anybody who owns a dog my only complaint is that in week  the teacher gets quite a bit overboard into all of evolution there is no need for this because the course is on dog emotion and cognition not primate and human evolution i felt i was a captive audience for his own unnecessary preaching on primate evolution the best example i can give is the classic times when a person would invite you over for dinner only to sell amway other than that the course was wonderful great teacher	3
good job i really enjoyed having this course and learn new tips but if you can open the quiz parts so participants are able to solve them without having to purchase the course certificate that will be betterthanks for your effort	4
dr chunk is very nice and the course is perfect recommend	4
best course for beginners very much informative and practical	4
very challenging with the goal to bring a complete strategy to life	4
my first course with coursera  loved it	4
great content horrible technical support from coursera and the team that runs this program since it is clearly obvious that michael mannino just recorded the videos and is not part of the class anymore	2
he does a fantastic job of introducing a complex subject each programming assignment builds on the ones before it adding more complexity	4
andrew ng did a great job with this course he covers algorithms and others tools to do machine learning being new to machine learning i believe i got an idea what it is about and how to apply the methods	4

cutting edge cryptography topics good explanations and slides but pause button is highly recommended can be a bit too mathematical for the general public and not very formal for mathematicians	4
i really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone who wants to start and learn korean i hope more advanced courses will also be available	4
this course makes a valiant effort to provide as much coverage of bayesian statistical methods as the prior three courses in the statistics in r specialization do for frequentist statistical methods but the lack of supporting material eg readingtext exercises directly paired with each lesson really hampers this the videos are quite informative but if you dont catch on to the material based strictly on the videos the weekly quizzes can be a bit frustrating	1
i love the professors but unfortunately i do not feel much connection to me not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements i am not an investor and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statementsthe managerial accounting week  transforms my mindset i really appreciate that that one single week of course can literally help so many companiesngos that week  should be promoted more	2
amazing course congratulations and thank you dr chuck	4
this is a very nice executive level explanation of data science topics these  professors are excellent communicators of this field	4
i really enjoyed the course which was interesting and useful professor oakley and dr sejnowski both did a great job presenting the material i look forward to using some of the learning techniques in my other endeavours	4

good course to learn some basics skip it if you are at an intermediate level	4
it is a really good introduction to writing i love it the format of the course is excellent for virtual studies the time periods are good for completing the assignments combine with every day activities	4
a bit outdated now however it is still a good resource to get started	2
explanations are clear the lenght of the videos is ideal for someone who likes to study on weekdays but also has a full time jobive read some of mitzberg and porters work and this course encompases their ideas but does not just stay with that they add new approaches for actual and future businesses	4
the only issue we does not have the data set to validate our code	3
fantastic course i learned a lot about the fundamentals of international criminal law	4
i feel dual emotions about how this course is organized although the course project was hard to perform without much background in genomics it was the part where i learned the most  thanks to the staff and the other students in the forums	3
a pretty mathheavy class but it is very rewarding in terms of understanding fourier analysis and dsp very well organized overall	4
this was such a good course im very happy i took it thank you so much for teaching me how to learn king regards from brazil	4

really interesting course most of the course out there are only technical about programming this is about effective design effective visualization	4
this course helped me discover the writer inside of me	4
fantastic class very informative	4
this is a great introduction course to machine learning coming to the class i wasnt sure if the math involved would be too complex to follow but professor ngs clear explanation of the concept and intuition behind complex algorithms made them much easier to understand or dare i say enjoyable the programming exercises are not too difficult either once you get over the first hump of familiarizing yourself with octave or matlab i used octave for the first time for this course	4
a really great course that deliver exactly its promises  a collegegrade algorithmic courseif you are looking to know all about classical data structures arrays lists trees heaps  used in every program this is the course for you and if you are not interested in those topics  well you should or course this is a challenging course by it abstract nature but with some work the support of the instructors and of your peers you will overcome the difficulties after that with your newly gained knowledge you will be able to choose the right data structure for your needs or implement it efficiently in the language of your choiceworth mentioning the course is languageagnostic  and the assignment may be submitted in c c java or python	4
getting started with the tools	2
poor compared with some of the others on this specialisation the lectures are too fast and high level with no allowance given for people who are unfamiliar with this area and attempting to learn it	0
a great tool for beginner writes but not very good at showing you how to write specifically for children	3
it is my first course two weeks have passed and i am learning and relearning the professor is really good and i am motivated every day to be on track i registered for the course i wish to pass the course	4
good video lectures pointless assignments 	1
my cs friend recommended me to take this course to learn more about how to use data in business after he heard that i wanted to program an app for food he warned me about the great deal of math involved mainly linear algebra me being a physicsengineering major i naturally got even more excited it turned out that he was right and it would also be a huge plus to know multivariate calculus and i can see myself struggle with the concepts had i not studied both these topics to bits in school incidentally this was my first online coursera experience i can tell you it will be life changing experience no longer do i have to physically travel somewhere to listen to lectures or hand in assignments nor download lecture notes off of the school server this is a  always on always available service with the best tas to answer your questions if you get stuck on homework assignments and quizzes everything in the coding assignments tests your knowledge of the course lectures and is designed such that you can complete it in the shortest possible amount of time while reaping the maximum amount of benefit it is easy sense does not require you to grind through mundane things like looking for your own training set data or writing code to plot and visualise the data but it is hard in the sense that very often it takes an hour or more of studying the lectures and thinking to figure out how to solve the problem in the most efficient way as possible which often involves writing a single line of vectored matlaboctave code it is more of an overview of the most important topics in machine learning but will be a great springboard to go in depth into each aspect of it lastly andrew often offers wonderful insights into the day to day of machine learning professionals in his lecture videos so i would advise watching every single minute of them to get the most out of the course instead of aiming to race over the finish line which can be tempting at times when the deadline approaches	4
the theories for the models should be explained in more detail and with few more examples	2
its fantastic	4
interesting topic worth considering	4
thats amazing course you definitely can have a clear view of machine learning algorithms after carefully watching this well prepared videos thanks for andrew and editors	4
great course	4
unfortunately this project is not fully aligned with all the previous program which is a shame ideally the project was more related to quantitative data or have compulsory module npl it was certainly a very important learning but very stressful to have to grasp npl and do the project in a short timelearning npl in short time in a diy way without any help it was very negative and stressful	1
good introductory course	3
this was a phenomenal course full of very useful info for musicians of all levels of leadership it ranges from basic conducting to rehearsal strategies to score study and it is enhanced with dr feldmans interviews with the orchestra and choral directors at uncchapel hill could not recommend this course more highly	4

extremely useful course the instructor is a very experienced and a very nice person too highly recommended	4
it is a great course finally machine learning become more clear to me the class is interesting and focus on explaining it rather than knowledge deliver the assignments are also well designed which help me enhance my learning i hope this course can be continuing because it is a great help for us	4
helpful coursei love this course and thank dr severance giving us beginners this useful course i can follow the steps and make sense to me who have no programming background at all highly recommend	4
this review does not reflect the course content the new coursera ui makes it impossible to download transcripts or slides of the videos without these features following the lectures is significantly more difficult and i cant rate this course any higher than  star i would rate it zero stars if that was possible	0
the teacher seems to mainly read the slides and the tone is quite scholastic not a lot or engagement indeed the course gives some info on the social background of doping on how it is fought and it is adopted worth it if you have a strong interest in sports	2
i liked the course	4
excellent summation of preceding courses peer review was particularly helpful in comparitively evaluating your own project and how one can improve their use of these tools very good course	4

clear simple and logical readings and tutorials great to get back into business theory after years in industry good to get back to basics and put into perspective where you currently are	4
they talked a little about ldl and hdl which is goodbut the rest was just a summary of avoid processed foods eat less and eat less meat and ways to do it it is important but i thought the course lacked science and it was very very short	1
very good course its helped me so much	4
the course is too shallow  amount of topics discusses is quite small practice tasks are boring  implement pseudocode given in lectures no quizzes in particular you can see that it is a bad course if you compare it to the previous  courses in the specialization im agree with other people posting in forums about thatwasted time could spend that month more productively not going to continue passing other future courses	1
this course definitely changed the way i feed my children it requires more trips to the store but knowing i am putting healthy sustainable choices in front of them makes it feel like less of a burden the way the material was presented was very understandable and made you want to continue	4
fun  effective teaching	4
fantastic course for an undergraduate like me not only for this undergraduate but also for the ones who like to enhance their learning ability better than before in any field the age is not the constrain to understand the course material	4

its really good opportunity to learn more about the environment inside the work and how to deal with the problems in a professional way	3

i was hoping for something a little more technical this course might be good for someone who has no previous knowledge of the nutrition content of food or how to cook it would be perfect for kids getting ready to head off to college whove never cooked for themselves	2
its was an interesting course i wanted to learn python from such a long time and thank you university of michigan and coursera for bringing the course to me and thank you prof severance for teaching me python in such a wonderful way i m looking forward to taking similar courses in future	4

its a great course i recomend	4
excellent content and instructions fun to learn	4
the whole course was very useful and inspiring and the lecturer is great thank you	4
this course was great it helped me a lot	4
not as good as the previous courses in this specialization  i agree with those who have noted that this one seemed a little rushed however these are still the best courses ive found on coursera	3
great course learned a lot and hoping to complete all five of these	4
the best way of marketing research	4
the course is not bad but i felt that it was just a collection of common sense advice	2
a solid introduction on the big picture of graphic design i am so motivated to dive deep into more details by taking the class	4
very good and quick course which gives you some hints on what you can improve in your approach to studying its a valuable resource of learning advice and mechanisms which allow your mind to learn its a great subject to study not only as a fundamental for other studies but also on its own	4
excellent the one every courseraer should take	4
i looked forward to each weeks newly posted lectures and other content this is a wellorganized course and one learns the various principles including the more technical without much effort also dr shane dixon is a gifted teacher his success at teaching this class proves that the teaching methods he presents yields successful learning indeed a recommended course	4
really its very helpful for me and helped me in my college thanks you	4
the microbiome course has been a great course i enjoyed each part of it thank you for all efforts to put it together and to make it available to everyone it would be great if some of the readings which are part of the course can be all made available outside the pay walli wish a great success for the american gut project including canada and later include mexicobig thank you	4
absolutely useful	4
a very good course where im learning how much is important the python language	4
one of the best courses on coursera	4
the course focuses on a number of critical aspects in video game world design such as artistic direction spatial and physical rules and movement considerations and it teaches a few methods of planning them that said the presentation of these ideas and methods feels less organized than the others in the course that said all of them are useful and if the exercisessubmissions dont quite lead up to as organic a whole as the others it makes up for it by covering bases with varied approaches	3
this course was extremely helpful in analyzing strategies and very well researched i appreciated the course very much and all of the work that must have gone into it thank you	3
the course has been really useful to me i would like to thank both my instructors and the entire coursera team for having given me a wonderful opportunity to learn and discover myself	4
excellent introduction to python well explained helpful skillbuilding assignments and very good learning environment fantastic book thanks	4
as mentioned in the discussion form it is really difficult to accept the fact i have a challenge to accept and i need to solveleadership is not a cake walk and needs vision to become a leader and lead peoplethis course has helped me a lot to become a visionary leader thanks to every single member of this team great job	3
interesting course though it shows me how difficult is for me to understand everything i was difficult to follow it because the videos were too slow and sometimes i went away besides i wanted to download the transcriptions and sometimes it was imposible in the ipad near the end of the course i found out that i needed to close my session on the ipad to be able to have access to my course with my laptop it is true that i am learning english an maybe this is a hard course for me or maybe it is because i am not a philosopher even if i love them	3
very nicely compiled set of lectures i am new to machine learning and am finding this course very conducive to understanding some key ml algorithms using a casestudy approach	3
a very good introductory course the teacher is excellent as are the video lecturesunfortunately the new coursera rules requiring payment before assessments can be accessed meant that i didnt complete any of the assessments that will probably be a major disincentive for many learners who want to confirm what they have learnedalso uci have elected to disable the discussion forums for this course although i found they could still be accessed via the coursera app on my android phone i cant help wondering if this was as a result of some of the negative feedback posted on the forums in the earlier courses of this specialisation if so this really doesnt reflect well on uci as a teaching institution	2
course content is good however instructions for the assignments are not complete often instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums sometimes in multiple threads and the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum this can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign the assignment pages should be updated to properly include all requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment	2
fantastic course so much great information and i always feel uplifted while doing it	4
great easy to follow very well video lecture and very useful	4
the course material is fine in fact its good however i completed the entire course in  hours whilst i have some basic programming experience i am by no means an expert there really is very very little material in this course the assignments are also very simple and automatically graded the course fees are not particularly transparent i think the course is far too expensive for the content provided all of the other reviews i have seen for this course are a single line such as i liked the course a lot or something equally vacuous and unhelpful if you are a beginner i would suggest trying python for the absolute beginner by michael dawson if you have any programming experience you might be better with a more advanced course	1
i am finding this course very useful for me some places i lack using some correct verbs and sometimes not seeing parallel structure of the sentence this course is helping me identifying those areas which are needed to be corrected	4
its very interesting course im learning new things that were not noticed before	4
a little bit easy i guess this course is for the beginners	2
i think its an essential course	4
this is a great course very helpful in understanding business metrics better and at helping create a foundation in big business and data some of the videos around the specific numbers were a little vague on what was an example and what was an actual metric all things considered still well worth the time money and effort 	3
good guide to how the internet developed very well presented	4
i reviewed and learned a lot of java object oriented programming concepts it was really fun	4
great course sort of sws rogue one  the one after that you eant to study the univers of engenering	4
get to know the bolts and nuts of the world mechanism	3
i have never had calculus explained to me so well before attending this course thank you	4
professor caselli is an amazing teacher with a real expertise and a lot of experience in private equity and venture capital the lessons are clear and wellstructured nonetheless i would have liked to work on modelling as well in these lessons	3
easy to follow great introduction to topics very good to have a quick overview of interfacing with arduino	4
cool enjoyed this course a lot	4
this course offers a great foundation for learning to live a more healthy and sustainable lifestyle the information is presented in a way that absorbs well between the videos and the visuals along with the lecture this course has the capacity to change peoples lives and it has definitely given me the information and confidence needed to be able to move forward with action	4
ideal for a guy who doesnt know a bit about webdesigning but want to learnthis is the first step that you should take	4
i took this course about  years off the college and it was excellent refresher on the topics i dont use on a daily basis absolutely great lecturer great videos and study materials	4
brilliant course it is more like fundamentals of machine learning	4
a very interactive beginners course enjoyed the programming assignments thoroughly best regard to the teamabhishek	4
the best place to learning	4
there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos which is fine and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audienceto solve these problems i have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for helpi agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practiceyou cant slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand much harder than anything seen during class and expect me to do it in  hours per week maybe  hours per daydisappointed i wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but i will most likely try to get back the money i spent on this and let it go	0
excellent course to build the most important foundation of a leader ie introspection and an insight into self to part that selfless notion into a leader to excel and exceed beyond others and for others	4
great course do help me a lot in study especially chemistry and mathematics	4
please include the python in the coming tutorial so students can find it easy	4
excellent introduction to qualitative research methods loved the lecturers enthusiastic style and quirky sense of humour very engagingassessments were practical and supported the course material	4
good introduction	3
this course is brilliantthe lectures are full of information but theyre also funny engaging and always enjoyable and there are loads of them  hrs so this feels like quite a thorough introduction to calculussome of the exercises are pretty tough for a newcomer like me but the answers are always thoroughly explained the lack of a hard time limit is very welcome because it gives you time to take in new ideas at your own pace without rushing you through assignments or testswhats more its all free hats off	4
outstanding from beginning to end dr mcphees knowledge of and enthusiasm for his subject are infectious i have enjoyed every minute	4
very useful	4
i found it very full in the área of astrophysics	4
great and inspirational course thank you prof freeman for your approach that is making us think reflect and question the current models of businesses in our societies	3
i really enjoy	4
the required reading is a bit long and because its all written its hard to go through at one time so would there be some videos source instead i could use to facilitate learning in a more visual way	4
exceptionally easy to understand and follow great whether you have been involved in the equine industry for a few years or are a newcomer teacher is easy to understand and makes the videos entertaining and fun to watch	4
thanks	4
very good and informative course	4

great course that helps you improves your learning performance	4
as the rest of the courser this one is another example of a good job	4
excellent thoughts and concepts presented	4
excellent course and very useful skills learned	4
interesting content but issues with broken links needed to complete quizzes while they were due needs better explanation of how to use other resources many of the quiz questions are arbitrary rather than really testing knowledge gained in the class the lectures are still useful and would recommend doing this as a free course but see no use in paying for a certificate on completion of the course	1
very interesting very well organized thank you	4
a superb introduction to negotiation from game theory point of view which itself is a fascinating subject and taught by barry nelbuff a brilliantly simple teacher read his books and youll know	4
the videos were not always easy to understand because of the unclear pronouncing of the key speaker also although most of the tests were easy to complete the ones that you had to write the answer down instead of only choosing the correct answer were hard since if one word you wrote was wrong you lost the question	2
excellent theoretical view and very good exposure to real life excel modeling	4
loved learning the great simple healthy recipes also great information for kids teens and adults	3
really good course	4
very useful	4
very useful course and very pleased learning experience love this	4
interesting informative and useful i quite like the selfquestioning part which makes publication reading more effortless thanks	4
i am new to statistics and found most of the lessons difficult to understand although i did pass the course and had taken the first two courses of the specialization before more exercises would help also i do not plan on using r in the future so this part of the course was not very relevant to me but it was not the hardest	2
perfect course for machine learning 	4
the course is too very basic and is very slow i am not from a programming background and still feel so	2
the content in this course is essential but the delivery is patchy and the course project is hard to complete with just the learning materials provided read around the course and visit the data science specialisation wiki for extra information and work through it at your own pace rather than that suggested by the course its much easier to do this now its on the new coursera platform o	2
this course has valuable information but it is ultimately political the professors dont even disclose that there are two opposing historical schools new historians whom palestinians reference and traditional historians favored by most israelis which version is followed here the answer is a mix without identification this is not the same as balance which would entail each side laying out its key points and evidence as others note there is zero reading material one wonders if this is because to choose a historian is to choose sidesthat is how divisive this topic is the discussion forums are also poorly monitored unlike other coursera courses which does not advance understandinga little knowledge is a dangerous thing unfortunately applies to this condensed intro course and contrary to expectations for an offering from tel aviv u most israelis would likely be offended by some of its assertionsomissions for example israelis recall that palestinian founding father haj amin alhusseini was a nazi agitator in europe and bequeathed an antijewish ideology netanyahu even made a speech about this in  that was covered internationally yet in this course you will be told simply that alhusseini was a man of religion	1
very informative and interesting	4
i have got very useful information about big data and the need for mapreduce programming model and hadoop distribution framework i had also got very clear understanding of how to run a mapreduce framework using open source cloudera virtual machine the entire course is easy to read and understand and fun thanks for the instructors	4
very insightful and valuable information for a student and for professionals	4
the right course which gets you started with programming the instructor makes it right too by putting in tremendous effort in explaining the content with so much fun	4
great content invites you to go further on the subjects and shows you a different approach on sustainability design that the one you are used to see in your company or citys vision	3
an easy not simple but humorous approach to a broad topic with practical samples that you can build on for further studies good for newbies as well as a fresh up for advanced applicants looking forward to the follow up courses	4
one of the best accounting courses i have ever taken	4
i am very pleased with the structure and content of this course i have taken over a dozen clases on coursera in the past year across a wide variety of disciplines and this is definitely one i am going to see through to the end if you are interested in how public policy drive governments corporations  and ngos behaviour which in turn impacts directly upon individuals and entire populations this is a great primer highly recommended	4
very helpful	4
as a python newbie i found this course challenging yet so much fun to learn dr brooks presented the lectures in a very organized way and made them easy to follow if you have experience in r you probably would pick up pandas real quick students are expected to devote a lot of time into the assignments and try to find the answer on your own but with all the great tips and clarifications from our diligent mentor sophie greene its definitely achievablewill take the other courses in this specialization and definitely recommend it to anyone whos interested in data analysis	4
a great experience with a very nice initial approach to machine learning 	4
excellent courses in a simple but deep understanding way of ml	4
good course to help me get organized	4

thank you it was very useful	4
the exam really covers all material in the course prepare yourself by reviewing all materials especially on graphs dynamic programming and algorithm complexity	4
amazing and very useful course for any part of live	4
its good introductory course into the supply chain planning world	3
i did not find this helpful for a complete beginner i will try an alternative course	1
excellent for introducing someone to programming in python in my case it was easiest to move from a language like cc to learn python	4
horribly designed and developed jack wu may be an expert but he does not know how to teach others	0
i really enjoyed this course but it really is more of an introduction to the rest of the specialisationa lot was repeated over and over which seemed a little tedious at times but in actuality it made sure i really understood and clearly processed the most important informationlooking forward to the next course	3
introduces lot of machine learning techniques which are used by practitioners 	3
i havent completed it yet but i loveit already	3

a good course	3
awesome practice and good gui framework	4
best course i have ever taken hands down	4
the course gives the very basiс knowledge of python but it is very detailed and easy to understand	4
just enough to do some damage making api calls and parsing	4
fun course that explores why dogs are so special i especially it when dr hare explained the different experiments and their results	4
too easy little content can pass course easily without watching any of the videos	0

so many techniques or tips or tricks not only help for learning but for living	4
well made course hare knows his stuff interesting if you like dogs _	4
i wish i had taken this course when i was at school	4
a good introduction to urban infrastructures and management it touches on the key issues and gets you thinking about the interrelated challenges the course does not go into a great amount of depth in any area in particular but it does suggest plenty of interesting avenues for further research and investigation recommended	4
it is a delight to learn from people so enthusiastic and committed	4
very useful and helpful course i know more about philosophy since taking this course which is the objective therefore it is successful	4
not for beginners unless you are willing to invest a significant amount of time with outside sources beyond what is stated as needed to complete the course disappointing	0
really helpful thanks so much to dr ng for sharing this with the community	4
this brief course provided me plenty of practical tools to enhance my learning and studying as well as to avoid illusions of competence i particularly enjoyed the lectures in the first and the third weeks though the whole series of lectures are extraordinary helpful also the optional videos are great and very encouraging	4
i thought the course was good  but i think the final case study could have been more specific i reviewed a lot of colleagues and the quality greatly varied though most got the answers correct since it was a quite general question	4
a really interesting course complete yet condensed to understand most of the future of revenue management the comprehensive demand management accessible to most and really well made will recommend	4
very important practical course for people from all walks of life after all we all negotiate on a regular basis i greatly enjoyed this course dr siedels delivery of the material is very clear and engaging thank you dr siedel for preparing this course	4
absolutely great	4
great intro course instructor is clear concise and has a great enthusiasm for the subject and it transfers through his lectures to the students	4
its a quiet complex topic in general terms it is well covered but in my opinion there should be at least an exercise per video explaining something similar to the invideo questions it should have a demonstrative part rather than just talking about it and showing the formula	3
very interesting and useful course	4
the better course i have ever realized on coursera theorycally strong and truely applicable	4
incredibly comprehensive learning package which makes learning and skills acquisition easier kudos to the creators and instructors	3
i really liked this class it was interesting and fun	4
the course overall has good content but some videos and case studies were dissapointing in terms of uniqueness of information you could have easily googled it tests could also be more challenging i would defitenely reccomend it to learners who are new to the industry for others it could be less informative	2
i like the way of explanation and good to know some more interesting things in bootstrap	4
absolutely recommended	4
best online course on machine learning there is if you are going to take only one ml course in your lifetime take this one	4
this course was so helpful to understand every day leadership and motivation in decision making	4
this has been a great learning experience for me i developed an appropriate routing was the exercise of a conscious leadership where i have raised awareness of the connection with people to establish meaningful communication  thank you very much for giving me the opportunity  thank you 	4
it is very nice to see an introductory course in linguistics especially for it being free and available online i would not have had an opportunity like that anywhere here locally which makes this course special to me the instructor and his pupils were paramount to the learning experience and with the addition of interviews and recommended readings this course excels in tactically defining and showing what linguists do and what they study i want to thank leiden university and marc van oostendorp for providing such a professionally delivered mooc	4
the presenter is good and knowledgeable but the information is barely skimmed over and there isnt any real opportunity to learn a few worked examples might be good	2
this course was an excellent experience i learned too much	4
great course and great teacher excellent explanations if you are looking for a good js course for fundamentals do not miss module 	4
good information and very interesting thoughts everybody should familiar himherself with this theory could make us all a bit nicer happier and positive	3

thank you very much very informative course presented in an excellent fashion	4
good course well structured just needs some technical improvements in order to be able to review wrong  right answers in quizzesnice to have a second more advanced course in this topicjoaquín	3
wonderful course have learnt about new technologies thank you	4
one of the finest courses of the coursera the topic is interesting as to how certain release of chemical neurotransmitter is involved in day to day life factors  the experiments and scanning of the brain imaging techniques show how the brain responds in various factors like how a drug addicted brain differs from the normal brain in metabolism interesting	4
its good to understand the aerial robotics its quite hard for me as english is not my native language its better if all the basic terms can be explained in supplyment material such as body fixed frame inertia frame etc the assignment is very good and helped me to understand the drones fly and controller finally its better to have all the mathmatical proof in supplyment material if its too long in the video	4
the course is well structured leading the learner through project based learning from one conceptual level to another its completion was very satisfying and i look forward to from nand to tetris ii	4
great	4
very basic for using python as a tool instead of focusing too much on the grammar not difficult	4
excellent course superb presentation leiden law school proves they are best in world for international tax	4
the lectures are much better than module  but still too thin on information required to complete the final assignment i probably spent  hours in all completing the assignment because i had to spend so much time looking up material that was not covered in the lectures a lot of my time got wasted since it is very difficult to figure out the syntaxstructure of the language from the very skimpy lectures or the very technical apple documentationalso not once did the instructors participate or respond to the forum discussion so it was not a surprise that the forum was barely used at alli am stuck with soldiering on with the next  modules since i prepaid for the specialisation but really i am very disappointed with what i am getting for a paid course	2
too much focusing on history of telephony and only little focus on iot	2
this course is	0
very good introduction to probability the concepts were really well explained i wish there was a sequel to this course covering other subjects in statistics i highly recommend this course for absolute beginners	4
very dynamic good teacher quality material it gives you different approaches about strategy as concept and shows you what can we learn from the past about strategists and how it is being applied these days	4
this is a very good course to master r fundamentals	4
professor harris does a good job overall but he does not explain python syntax in depth i audited the course and found it quite simple however i recommend a paid subscription to get the most out of it	2
nice course for beginners in python had lots of fun especially in the office hrs section of dr charles	4
great introductory course	4
i really enjoyed this course and found it to be very helpful a lot of the information was common sense but the science behind the rationale was very interesting and useful in learning anything new it will also be very helpful to me as i commit to learning and retaining new information i know the steps and their value in creating a better working memory and longterm memory for myself	3
it was great help in my study it was better than my expectation it covered many topic and lectures were easy to understand thank you to uc drbarbara oakley drterrence and coursera for this course	4
most of contents are already in the books like cracking the coding interview and similar ones if you have them you dont need to take this courseit can be good for students who have never had an interview	1
very good course i can recommend it to everybody who want to get a deeper understanding on learning an barbara is the perfect teacher thank you very much for you frindly way of teaching	4
good course fast and easy to getcould be enhanced by a few practical examples where the formulas presented could make more sense	3
great course	4
the course is very detailed with a strong methology and useful examples nevertheless it wasnt always simple to follow and the last week was very demanding	3
a wonderful course to get you started on getting the basic tools and packages of r installed on your pc highly recommended for first time learners of r	4
excellent introduction and refreshingly presented thank you	4
this course offered great insight into the learning process and gave plenty of easytoapply solutions to deeper learning and overcoming procrastination it also went through useful test taking tips and strategies im leaving this course with a more thorough understanding of how my brain works how to learn more deeply and effectively and how to handle difficult testtaking situations	4
great course highly informative the generative models parts is especially interesting	4
thank you	4
this is my first time to program with ruby this course lets me have fun with ruby programming thank all of you sincerely 	4
this is in my opinion a very good introduction to html the instructor is top notch and the delivery is very smooth the content isnt too technical starts a a very basic level without being too simplistic builds up to an interesting final project and the entire course can be mastered in just a few hours	4
the last assignment was definitely a stepup from the other weekly assignments which i found very challenging this coming from a novice in fp the lectures were well presented and clearly demonstrated functional techniques as well as the theories behind them some may find the lectures a bit tad too academic but thankfully most of such lectures can be skipped without too much detriment to completing the assignment all in all an excellent course	3
a huuuuge amount of great information very professionally presented easy to put into immediate practice thank you	4
should be followed by every people who say is a programmer	4
exciting it is clear and informative	4
love the python specification so much and really make a lot progress	4
thank you to everyone involved in making this course happening the information offered is vital to understanding how we learn in my opinion i have learned and finally understood important concepts of learning that i should have learned earlier in my life i am very thankful for being one of the participants in this class and would suggest it to anyone sad that this is not taught in school before we venture out into the world to become a grown up person	4
i learnt something but i can never able to use it i have no idea anyway ml is just still having the real application for the command development field in the business now for example like me working in software development firm and medicare company before none of them really applied the machine learning theory although they have certain value if applied for example i saw many of them trying to convert their business to big data business however they never use the big data correctly assuming applied a machine learning in order to predict the potential customer response of a single product it looks fun anyway fact is fact currently the business is still a relatively low technical level business everything is report linear and simple  i will not say unfortunately at least i have time to write this comment when i am actually working	4
outstanding the classic papers are always the best primary source of information	4
very informative and makes eating better exciting	4
prof taylors lectures were clear and easy to understand the course taught the basics of planning pretty wellthe teaching staff unfortunately was completely unavailable the solution checkers for the matlab assignments were very brittle and wasted a lot of students time there were several queries about the assignments on the discussion forums most of which did not elicit any response from the teaching staff the students ultimately figured it out by spending several laborious hours figuring out the peculiarities of the solution checkers and by helping each other this certainly soured my experience with the course	1
i love this course i learned a lot it ignited my passion for writing again	3
very very nicely explained	3
helpful lecture on writing a business plan and what it takes to be an entrepreneur basically a very small overview of business school and then great advise and instruction on how to get your business launched without any huge debilitating early mistakes or time wasted over planning	4
excellent advanced course not for beginner in computer science nor for people more interested in applying computer science than in theoretical foundations	4
some of the videos has low quality which make them harder to understand for non native speakers in my opinion there is also too less tips for second assessment	2
this course covers the nuts and bolts behind the various machine learning algorithm it abstracts the learner from the complex maths  while providing good exercises to implement the algorithms in octave as well as giving a understanding of each parameter of the algorithm which can help the implementer tune it better engineers paradise	4
i experienced lot of interesting course materials and sessions a very best course for anyone look into world in new view	4
absorbing enlightening practical and all round great course  highly recommended	4

the professors and the lectures were excellent homeworks are way to easy would like to use open source tools like pandas and scikit learn instead of proprietary tools like graphlab	2
a good follow up to the first part i found the testing section particularly useful i could only wish the course was longer and delved deeper into classes and exceptions	4
good course	4

a bit of repetition with module  of the specialization	2
excellent introduction to java	4
fantastic course	4
excellent course for a beginner	4
provides a nice basis in understanding how economic principles are used to investigate agriculture production could provide a bit more of an economic foundation but the course is broad rather than deep	2
tough course very close to being in a classroom with plenty of material in every video keep a book on the topic handy and you will understand the material better	4

this could be improved by adding more interesting subjects  how to use list adapters with list view how to use menus how to use scrolling view etc	2
very informative course coursera should have more fashion related courses	3
well explained i liked it	4
this course aggregates a lot of best practices how to learn better barb goes in deep explanations how our brains are working on both high and low levels seems like fall of the course mostly targeted for sturends	3
i really liked the course but i would have loved more clases and practices anyway thaks for all	3
very informative and practical with examples	3
this course did not live up to its potentialthe course should be retitled as an intro to statistics not learning functions and visualizations on exceli still have three stars because i at least picked up some useful concepts from it	2
this course is very much enjoyable	4
just awesome	4
the course content and all assignments can be looked though in one day everything really useful will appear in the mooc  and on as different tools will be given	3
the teacher is just awesome i love this thanks alot for making this available for everyone for free i really appreciate it	4
a course definitely worth taking i learned alot	4
really useful thank you guys	4
this first series is the most basic python the professor gave the lecture in a very clear and dynamic way i really enjoy the whole learning process and i am expecting to learn more advanced knowledge in the following lectures	4
a very good introduction to programming for the beginners i really appreciated it	3
as a learning course the final project was specificationless they should ask for something specific and explained well they should test conecpts not asking for whatever idea you have apply what you learned i think this is an old school method	2
great course the activities were nice and challenging the instructors did a good job of explaining things in diverse ways	4
great course i loved the teachers	4
i entered this course with no coding experience and i can definitely say i am disadvantaged because of it the lectures are great explanations of the different commands in r and the projects are a great playground of rs different capabilities but the lectures and projects are too difficult to approach using just the lectures that being said this courses difficulty provides students like myself the opportunity to learn how to ask questions and seek resources for the programmingoverall i do not enjoy this course  mainly because it is very difficult however the course is structured logically and provides what i assume the majority of students a comprehensive introduction to r	3
really enjoyed this lecturer the organization and presentation of the field and gave me some ideas to explore i enjoyed this course much better than the univ of minnesota one if you are looking at both i have the perspective of a medical health professional that is involved clinically	4
its great	4
prof hinton has an interesting viewpoint on machine learning models other than neural networks watch videos in the later weeks	4
very good intro to meteor	4
the professor is one of the best professor in the whole world in my humble opinion	4
thorough introduction to different ml algorithms that identifies the features they each have in common making it easier to understand all of them and how they compare to one another definitely a great starting point for anyone interested in this space	4
great course  week two is an exceptional lesson on influence	4
this course is actually very nice and easy to get with if you a new learner just dont worry it wont take you a lot of time and you will really get familiar with python and how everything will work after learning it	4
assignments were difficult but would have been easy had i first been exposed to the material in later courses not sure why the specialization is structured that way ill definitely revisit my code for these assignments	3
a short and concise introduction to basic english grammar blocks including verbs conjunctions adverbs clause and type of sentences good examples in lectures to make things clear	4
i am presently taking this course for fun i love writing specially creating poetry i find the instructor very engaging interesting and motivating he also seems to know his subject very well he makes the time i spend in class worthwhile he is just plain fun love this classjuliaboulder co	4
loved the activities it was a fun course to do	4
the course responded very well to my expectations it outlines and analyze all the elements and strongly prompts you to think about design making and to ponder each component of it and it makes you work i learned a lot technically by myself having to submit assignments looking at the materials i made i almost cannot believe i did it by myself the only thing i wish i had more time to work on it and perhaps if the students knew since the very beginning they will finally make use of each assignment to create a very final one they would probably consider this when choosing objects styles techniques but maybe this is stated since the beginning and i did not realize that anyway absolutely worthy	4
thank you for this great course	4
great course a very solid and current approach to media the content has high quality and is well balanced value added for sure	4
very interesting i am enjoying taking this course	4
interesting clear  useful	4
very clear but the project is not very difficult	3

i really enjoy learning python on coursera thank you all of you for the support	4
good short introduction to the field who someone with minimal understanding of data science	3
great course awesome profs will definitely recommend	4
its very interesting	4
it was fun doing this course and at the same time was quite informative the small things matters most is what you realise and long time back mahatma gandhi has said most of the things especially the economic and ecological aspects of our food consumption and habits and has predicted the difficulties we would face jc kumarappa on economy of permanence is a good read in this regard excellent presentation and even a kid will watch it with great interest	3
the lectures are really good simple to understand and test our ability well in the assessments the assignments which were partly helped by the lecturers is really provoking students to complete them with ease and precision its really practical enough to start coding in a new language realtively easy	4
very good summary of strengthsweaknesses of various machine learning algorithms this lecturers style and production quality is much higher than in the previous two courses in the specialization series	3
 very helpful course for learning abc of ml if you complete this course you will find it very easy to follow in more advanced ml courses sometimes i found the course assignment overhinted by the mentors without knowing deeply you can complete some tasks easily and quickly expected more programming assignments in last two weeks but last two weeks only have quizzes more mathematical treatment was expected but that was intentionally avoided by andrew ng for this course i guess i missed the summary in text format in later video set of lectures	4
excellent deliveryfantastic external sources with clear and precise explanations from a graphical viewpointgreat range of industry expertise and professionals within the appropriate fields	4
quite an intensive course with lots of theory and practice make sure you have enough time before comitting to this course but over all good experience challenging and interesting meditation labs were great as well	4
very interesting well thought out and exciting course the original style of the material supply by teacher from god is able to captivate any skeptic who believes that mathematics  science boring	4
this course was not better than the first course not too much of practical included and mainly theoretical	3

very carefully presented and organized introductory course well put r support	4
the teacher was great but i was behind a month just because nobody will grade assigment on week	2
really great intro to machine learning  i think this class would have been better if the programming assignments had been a bit more difficult but overall really enjoyed this class and looking forward to continuing with the specialization	3
awesome course	4
this course is neither high level nor low level after having taking cloud computing concepts part i and  which were excellent i expected a continuation of the very deep level of technical material this course doesnt do this instead it is sort of much higher level except that the instructor fails to stay at the high level and will suddenly go deep  but without providing the detail so that someone to whom this is new will be totally lost given that i was expecting the technical depth of ccc parts  and  i already had much of the knowledge that was presented and could figure out what the instructor was trying to present but i felt bad for someone who wasnt already familiar with the material it is my opinion that the course needs to be taken offline and redonenote apparently i took a prior version of ccc parts  and  so my comments on those two courses may or may not apply anymore	1
overall this is a great course but i do wish that the written materials be revised and clarified the course videos are great prof kalman hazins approach is prefect for online teaching however the instructions for the programming assignments were not as clear as they needed to be there was more than one occasion where i had to spend considerable time trying to figure out what was being asked and for a newie any amount of confusion can stop can be completely debilitating and frustrating it can be the difference between giving up and becoming a developer	4
very well designed course for data science beginners	4
i think that the simply reading slides doesnt help people understand the idea is to make this courses as accessible as possible	0
very interesting info with regards to project menegement i appreciated the applied excel and microsoft	4
i should have started my learning at school just with this course i would recommend it to any child starting hisher education as well as any other person wanting to learn something new in lifecheers	4
it began with the basics of ionic and it ended with an apk that ive installed on my phone this mooc is a life changing one it includes a lot of amazing extra resources that you can learn from and the exercises were very important in helping me understand all the concepts taught it also encouraged me to go there and try many ngcordova plugins on my own	4
very helpful and informative course	3
great class	4
great course great professor	4
nice course however would have liked more specific examples of cyber conflicts along with how they were resolved to each countrys satisfaction  if there are any such examples to look at  thank you to you all for putting this course together	3
extremely interesting course which widen our outlook on the management	3
excellent instructor delivers in conversational tone and with many examples and excerpts the recommended reading list with links to most items is worth the time spent on them i have lived and worked in the tech world through the primary eras he discusses s to today and seeing the legal issues affecting the development and use of emerging technologies has been enlighteningi would be interested in seeing this approach applied to matters of privacy and security	4

i enjoyed the course as it highlights many strategies and insights into making effective visualizations it makes good use to tableau and gives practical examples the only thing i would like to see added is a simple instruction manual to accomplish some of the methods they employed overall i think it was great to have this as a second course in the series because it lays the foundation for good design practices	4
very well explained its perfect if you never did any programminghowever if you did basic programming in school it might seem a bit too easyin my opinion it could be a bit more challenging especially on the assignmentsexcellent course overall 	4
course material was interesting but very rudimentary the courses biggest challenge was understanding its spoken english i do not recommend this course	0

absolutely exceptional course  i have learned so much in preparation for commencing my graduate certificate in arts and cultural management via correspondence this course not only provided great management insights and how institutions implement their product to the consumer it provided up to date methods of data processing and insight into marketing approach i will definately watch out for more courses with bocconi i could not be more grateful for the material and the opportunity to learn this much at no cost thanks for your time and amazing effort in putting together this course and thank you to our amazing host andrea rurale for being the enthusiastic professional guide through these learning modules	4
positive it was refreshing to see this offering in coursera it is an important topic and there is limited amount of offerings the wharton course in accounting analytics crosses in the benfords law topic the discussions in madoff snowden etc are positive to stimulate critical thinking the approach was solid the videos with real fraudsters were very good allowing to connect the theory to practice the final exam with  questions is also very positive to forcestimulate the student to cement the knowledge gainednegative this course was shockingly short if discounted the weekly videos with real examples of frauds per week there was only about  minutes of real materials this is not nearly enough a balanced output of resources to allow students to grasp the concepts institutions like wharton u michigan u illinois u virginia and yale are packaging in their top coursesspecializations at least  to  hours per module what can have between  and  modules plus resources  slides readings excel spreadsheets and others this is an enormous gap also  although it was positive to see the materials of the collegue and acfe sites more was expected for example it would be extremely valuable to have resources related to bernie madoff armstrong edward snowden to engage on a more dynamic discussion the slides used to back the video lectures should also been made available also in some topics more detail was expected for example benfords law it should been shown the formula used what is the threshold value to raise suspicion that manipulation might be present in the financials and also what are considered to be normal valuesoverall it is positive to see your offering but i think it can be improved and add a lot more valuablei wish you luck	2
the professor does a great job of explaining the content in an easily understandable way and is very practical the assignments require very minimal adjustments to sample code from the lessons so this is far easier than a typical course or say the edx mit intro to python course i came in feeling comfortable in rudimentary python and leave now feeling a lot more prepared to use those skills manipulating the web and calling apis	4
jupyter is a wonderful tool and graphlab is exciting	4
great course excellent professor	4
a fantastic content that helps you easily understand difficult concepts for the uninitiated in the field a highly recommended experience to improve only ask for more interviews with professionals who are now investigating the matterthank you very much for the effort	4
really liked it twice	4

great summary course on statistical inference	4
i decided to work on process mining for my phd thesis and encountered this course i read prof wil van der aalsts name from his papers when i realized he is lecturer i immediately participated in the course finally i strongly advice the course and the book process mining data science in action people who would like to learn process mining i hope i meet with him and his colleagues studying on process mining	4
i really enjoy this course it is informative effective and assertive the group of professors were committed for it in advance you can tell based on the planning and methods two thumbs uprealmente disfruto el curso es informativo efectivo y asertivo el profesorado se comprometió con las metas con anticipación se nota la planeación y los métodos bravo	4
while there is some interesting content particuarly in the last week on design thinking some of the course topics dont seem to hold together well and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads while this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally if youre not watching you miss the questions i would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for d printing with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lions share of the course i believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice	1
a good course that lacked practical information on performing a metaanalysis	2
excellent introduction to html css and javascript i used these over  years ago so this was a good refresher	4
this was a really well presented course giving a fantastic overview of inferential statistics and always presented with a sense of humour a number of really useful tools where introduced which i will be using again and again	4
best course of python ive taken so far tried with mitxs intro to computer science and learnpythonthehardwayorg without success the learning curve was too steep this one on the other hand progresses slowly and easily but in the end after a month or two you find yourself writing short programs in python which actually work wont make you an expert but it will help you to understand the general logic of the language and start coding for real took me about a month to finish it i highly recommend it	4
this course is super awesome eye opening concepts and plenty of exercises to drill down the concepts learned for a complete beginner like myself the problems and materials provided are sure to set you in the right mental direction i loved the emphasis on problem solving which is key in the field	4
michael pollan is wonderful great fundamental tips music can be distracting mayas speech is a bit slowpollans pace was stronger visuals were clean and easy to digest content was succinct and memorable appreciated the brevity of the videos thank you	3

stay up on your readings within this class	3
very well organized content and materials good presenter as well	3
very good introduction to scala and functional programming i really liked assignments	4
strongly recommendedthis course clearly introduces the basic algorithms and data structures to the students the professor not only explains the concept of the algorithms but also shows us the applications of them the homework of this course is substantial and deep it is really worthwhile to spend time on the homework	4
amazing course this is the first time that so much essential information about learning is accessible in a such well organized matterit was exciting to learn about the process and the organic materials in the brain when effective and noneffective learing process is take placei believe that this course can really help me to managie further learning processes on a daily basisthanksshai	4
very good for beginners who have no previous experience in programming chuck is a great instructor who brings fun to the learning process	4
a very informative course	3
great course clear introduction to concepts and code	4

dry videos most classes are someone showing how they do something their way rather than guiding or teaching with the intent to have the student absorb and reapply principlesvery difficult for a student to absorb material from this video series	1
some topics were explained in a shallow manner i suggest providing detailed lecture notes besides the videos for students trying to understand math and physics behind the concepts introduced in videos	2
great content but some very choppy editing which spoils the flow id much rather have longer lessons and less aggressive editing	3
great	4
way too easy assignments only good for people who never did any kind of programming for the rest its not worth the money	0
the overall information in this course was very informative and in some aspects rewarding as refreshers as where the mindset is with some population standards from a technical perspective i am not sure the system is working at 	2
super awesomethanks	3
more assignments would help reinforce learning	2
for the beginner it is excellent	3
i love this course very much as the lecturing very funny and interesting easy to learn and clear instruction is a highly recommended course for my friends  family	4
interesting topics but explanation is sometimes unclear	3
i really enjoyed the experience the videos are precise and give examples for the materials discussed however it feels a bit sparse on the overall length on the other hand the exercises test the knowledge acquired through the course and self learning	4
this was a tough class covering a lot of material the last week on logistic regression completely lost me if youre new to stats like me you might want to take it more than once	3

very engaging lectures and helpful complementary materials	4
i loved this course the professor is very clear at explaining and giving different points of view of the theories personally it was a huge help because of the situation i was in when i enrolled in the course and i think having a different view of the world and ourselves is incredibly useful and positive this course helps attain just that so i highly recommend it for someone who wants to test a little their ideas and perceptions of the world and themselves because its not just a theoretically course because it has science and experiments that help support ideas	4
really good introduction digital marketing coursevery good job aric	4

great course content andrew ng is a great teacher and the course structure worked really well for me	4

excelent introductory course it explains the basic concepts and keys to create and develop games before writing a single line of programming	4
dr chuck is a good man and thorough	4
as a college student i really appreciate how many of the tips shared are simple and can be implemented on a day to day basis a lot the recipes and ideas shared do not require really fancy equipment or ingredients ive never heard of are super expensive or hard to find the instructor truly cares about students leaning how to cook for themselves and eat healthier and provides information to do so without judgement her passion is clear and i love how she promotes little steps and not some drastic change that can eat up all of your energy and focus to implement thank you	3

probably the best online class ive ever done loved the simulation and how it went beyond things we learnt in class and required making several contextspecific decisions	4
great way to introduce us to the joy of teaching english it explains many resources to get an idea of how could you do it the right way on teaching english tips and advices and the best techniques for learning and acquiring english as a foreign or second language	4
i liked this course but i did not understand much	3
great course	4
this is a fantastic course probably the best course ive taken on coursera and other platforms for that matter what makes it great is that its really well paced theres not an abundance of overwhelming information and the fact that it uses some of the techniques recommended in the course like spaced repetition where some concepts are repeated several times during the course truly amazing stuff	4
really helps to understand how to managing agile team	4
ive learnt a lot from it  thank you for creating opportunities for all esl students and teachers	4

great course the course covers fundamental concepts and terms used within the field of epidemiology it also strengthens the knowledge understanding and design of the different types of studies that may be useful for scientists in basic science	4
this course is an opportunity to get acquainted with several machine learning techniques including linear regression logistic regression support vector machines svm anomaly detection nonsupervised learning clustering kmeans etc recommendation systems and very interesting discussions about batchminibatch versus stochastic learning and largescale learning systems it does not require a deep knowledge in algebra and calculus although a solid background in mathematics surely helps a lot and progresses in a logical manner from easy standard techniques to advanced onesif you are new in this realm this course is comprehensive enough to make you confident to design your own customized algorithms if you have some experience you can consolidate your knowledge and benefit from the tips the instructor gives throughout the course ive been dealing with adaptive filtering for some years and i can say ive enjoyed this course so much i definitely recommend it	4
a very good course i learnt a lot certainly worth taking many thanks to andrew ng for his lectures	4
great class very helpful forum if you get lost the videos are very straight forward so if theres ever the case you get stumped during an assignment you can get right back to the lesson	4
outdated unintelligibly exercises terrible lectures	0
i expected much more in this course in my point of view a very long time was spent to learn how to draw something in the screen i thought this course would be focused in object oriented programming and all about the best practices why not but it didnt sometimes was very hard to go on with this anyway thank you all	2
i learned new concepts and about the efforts of so many organisations towards health for all it definitely increased my interest in public health studies even more	3
i think its a really good opportunity to be able to obtain a tesol certificate online and this course seems to be able to do it very efficiently however i have found the approach of the style of the lessons a little bit slow and too dramatic and somewhat even childish im sure the planning of this certificate program is to ensure that people who take it will remember it so that they can really make use of it in their profession so they probably avoided long and boring lectures but still i must admit that the lessons look a little bit annoying sometimes  still thank you for the opportunity	3
very interesting	4
awesome introduction to ml highly recommended	4
this was a decent course some informative big picture information but i felt that it lacked some hands on understanding the minor hands on labs that were provided were challenging for anyone that is not familiar with python script writing i would suggest that you brush up on that before being comfortable with taking this course	2

very informative thank you for publishing this course 	4
this course really tortured me  but really worth the time and effort i did learn something by heart 	4
an good introduction to python geared towards people without programming experienceif you already have a good programming experience the only interesting thing of interest will be the syntax but thats just a fraction of the videos time you will probably start skipping forward on the basic ideas of how computers work and lessons will take just the time to listen to the videos and you probably will be able to finish a couple of lessons in one evening instead of a weeki really appreciated the extra videos that give some background on the history behind programmingat the end of this course you will have a basic idea of how a computer works and how you can instruct it to do still very basic things	3
great learning appreciate uci and coursera for making learning fun and accessiblekeep up the great job you have made a difference	4
love this course this course gave me a sense of purpose for my business and a strong frame for managing wealth	4

hi i am an it specialist  years experience i undertook the course so i could learn about ibm bluemix and iot development and extend my skillsunderstanding of the environment however i have very little good to say about this course offering i had numerous issues with what was offeredthe videos were generally ok but some had poor audio there was minimal video compared to any other course i have done and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpfulsome of the video material is out of date already as i suspect bluemix layout has changed  this made navigation a bit confusingthe downloadable pi image has changed since the course was prepared and the newer image has different code as standard i ended up having to muddlethrough manually loading packages and dependencies etc to get things to worki lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code just to get it to work for the grader tool this was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault but the majority of issues i ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments andor more detail about requirementslastly it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums  discussions in fact i think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issues when you have a course that is such a short time frame you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manneri could not in any good faith recommend anyone take this course in the future  which is a little saddening i do thank the lecturers for their efforts thus far and sincerely hope they can either improve or drop this course offering in the future	0
good course and intro to python coupled with codeacademycom it has been fairly easy	3

we tried to use this class to teach a brown bag lunch for our employees interested in programming python is a great language but this class has a very low content to volume ratio nobody wants to watch the instructor meet his lifetime idol at a tradeshow or watch the intel versus amd meltdown commercials over their lunch break	0

absolutely brilliant course and lecturer simply brilliant andrewso precisely spoken such brilliant tutorial notes wiki forum mentor tom mosher  thank youthis course is better than many paid university courses	4
could be more computer friendly had good information but hard to engage because the majority of the lectures are just powerpoints with the professor talking over them	2
teaching material is fine the professors explanation is monotonic and he uses textual definitions rather than simple explanations	1
great 	4
very good explanation about basic programming and algorithms help you a lot to get the concept	4
the continuity and smoothness of the first two python courses have been lost from week  onward the assignments were badly worded and that distracts the learning people were trying to decipher the wording of the questions not learning how to code lectures of later weeks were rushed very little buildup of understanding and i felt assignments were done for the sake of passing very little were learned during those final  to  weeks effort were mostly wasted as little learning has been retained may be there are topics that needed to be introduced for course  will see as ill be doing straight after the course overall is still very positive and the prof clearly has put in a lot of effort and they are greatly appreciated	1
perhaps im holding the video lectures to too high of a standard set by roger peng in previous courses but the videos are difficult to follow i can see the effort is clearly put in but all the actions going on during the videos are distracting at times	3
muy interesante y de buen provecho para iniciarse en este mundo de los negocios muchas gracias	4

another very interesting coursechallenging but fun i also love the interviews with prominent people from the it worldlooking forward to the next stage	4
the subject seems so interesting but we need more historical information its nice to have a personal point of view but it is difficult to follow the process then	0
the course practices what it preaches using several short video lectures that are cheesy in many ways but memorable nonetheless tests feel like a recall tool used to further learning rather than some sort of unsurmountable challenge overall because of the wisely broken down lecture clips the quality of the material given and the practicality and applicability to almost anyone i gave this course  stars	4
as an introductory course the content was good but i wish the approach was more analytical and more hands on rather than history of recommender systems  what happened in the s i would have been happier if the course was able to throw light on the latest stuff in this field the latest mathematical techniques etc	2
fantastic course its very thoughtfully designed and was perfect for the type of reflection needed to evaluate ones life and develop a theory of success i appreciated professor shells openness to the different ways people might define success he is definitely not trying to push anyone in a particular direction but providing resources to figure out your own direction	4

the content is good but the contents have a lot of overlap the instructors are definitely knowledgeble about the material and clear about the presentation but a lot of the same matierial are repeated throughout the course unintentionally think the insturctors just thought it was enough to throw a bunch of things together and called it the day	2
events dear boy yes yes we know but professor zelikow is determined to steer his students beyond events to a questioning of causality  to the whys as well as the mere whats in addition the course is very well structured and pitched i would say absolutely perfectly for the curious generalist only cavil is that one or two lectures are perhaps a touch too compressed even for such a brief course week three for example overall i would thoroughly recommend this course im not sure ive ever spent  so well on now to part two	4
the course is easy to underst	4

loved this course i thought yaakov thoroughly reviewed the concepts while focusing on good programming fundamentals i feel that i can adequately apply the skills that ive gained through this course in my future web development endeavors however i do believe that the grading guidelines are too generous so it would be difficult to employ a student based solely on a specialization in this course	4

testing choice isnt great writing a letter outline etc and submitting it for peer review would have been more productive furthermore some questions in week  test are confusing the original meaning the test designer is trying to convey is which dictates what the right answer is isnt clear giving too much room to interpretation not allowing the answer to be empirically right	2

course contents are rather deep which is good and makes it challenging explanations could be better and there should be more content on some topics for better understanding someone with background in statistics would find this course more useful than on who only has basic knowledge of statistics nevertheless it inspired me to learn from other sources to fill the gaps in my understanding	2

this class was actually about responsive web design not information design the two are in no way synonymous information design is about the visual display of information in a way that aids comprehension responsive web design is about creating different interfaces for different device form factors im not sure how a professor could possibly mix up the two but he didthe only reason im not giving it  star is that there was in fact some interesting info about responsive web design if coursera would change the title to responsive web design instead of information design id give the course  stars	1

i rated this as a  though i got a lot more out of the concepts and the class in the way it was taught than i had when reading books and literature on the subject i would have wanted more discussions with cohorts taking the class to help cement the practices by virtue of seeing it from other perspectives in different work environments i can imagine the same class with a moderator and someone facilitating the discussions would get me to the  rating in a nutshell the content is great the experience of the class could be at a higher level then what i experienced	2

the best algorithms course the video lectures are very good profsedgewick builds the concepts very well the code exampleslibrary written by prof wayne and prof sedgewicks code are very compact and the best i have seen the online website is great supplement to the book the auto grader is air tight that forces the student to think and write their code to the specs my greatest appreciations for prof wayne and prof sedgewick i wish students have the option to submit their solutions in c because in most of the languages the core algorithmsdata structures are often written in cc  i understand it is not easy because the course libraries and grader has to written for c	4

i posted a question on the last week on the forum and never received an answer from a mentor i had one response from another student which did not actually address the issue of my question and i had several views and it wasnt as if there were a lot of questions posted one course mentor could have easily answered all of them	2
this course very briefly presents large picture concepts of entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit i would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall the quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall ie questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey	2
excellent course with extremely detailed lectures	4
very practical course liked especially the tips about how to structure a good story all the elements of a good story and usage of external sources like ted talk as an example	3

while the topic is interesting the materials are poor and the lectures are not particularly insightful the slides have several mistakes and typos which makes you doubt the whole course the speakers are not engaging and it just looks like no effort was made in preparing this course additionally the materials do not prepare you for the review and on weeks  and  the hardest you dont have a chance to review the questions or correct your mistakes the course really needs some improving	1
its a good course but not very exceptional	2

amazing the way these teachers present information is awesome ive learnt so much from these course and the best thing is that they actually show you what it is like to be a teacher not just theorize like you do that but we will teach you differently great course  totally worth it	4
i would have enjoyed it more if i had had enough knowledge to do the honors quizi downloaded all the videos so i could play them over without chewing up my data but the quality is so poor you cant always make out the writing  is and js all look similar it would be better if the presentation material was bigger and the facilitator images smaller  you need only see a face not the whole upper body in the foregroundnevertheless i have been enlightened 	2
it would be nice to see more detailed explanation instead of reading the lines in slides also there is less practical content for real time usage	0
great course	4
very interesting and thank you for clearly organizing and the topics in which sustainable cities is being studied very helpful indeed specially in places where the topic is still not particularly in the policy agenda 	4
i think that course is so useful  it helps me understand more about food the most thing i like about it is the great videos form as it gives me info in an interesting way avoid learners to get bored and frustrated with the info  it goes easy and smoothly so  rated 	4
the course outline is very good however the presentation especially the slides can be monotonous the usage of various system engineering terminologies and jargon can be intimidating at times appreciate the instructors intention of keeping the videos and material very digestible on a weekly basis i would suggest them to include more case studies and activities from the professional realm as well i would also suggest them to bring in the awareness of various tools that are used throughout the systems engineering process it is still an excellent course and would highly recommend to any engineer out there	4
make yourself a favor just take the course i have done a lot of the opposite of what i should have done barbara oakley is so nice to explain to you every video is easy to muster and follow the course is not solely study techniques in the conventional form the most valuable parts are how our brain solves problems and the basic chemistry that affects it i enjoyed i have not finished watching the optional videos but i will and even bought the book definitely will review it often or as dr barbara said try to recall big parts of it and learn it deeply	4

the pomodoro the emphasis on  working memory slots and the supplemental videos with smes around memory palaces and focus learning were a big helpi also appreciated the focus on how to combat your zombies and work on procrastination were very helpful as well as the focus on the law on serendipityi also liked the emphasis on testing yourself with questions and recall as a way of mastering the material	3
i really enjoyed this course and i liked the variety of videos as well as special lessons with professionals from different fieldsthe exercises supported studies and gave better understanding of the toolshowever i believe some of the lessons or videos were a bit off from topic or gave too much focus on the issues that i believe are not that much related to the course purpose eg too much of d printingoverall it is a great course and i was pleased to participate in it	3
this course is in my opinion an extremely good starting point to approach project management both for professional or simply curiousit is dense enough to give a complete picture of matter on one hand and require a limited time effort on the oderthe speacking is so clear pronunciation lively never boring or soporificquizzes are affordable however not banali recomend this course to evrybody even for just general skilli thank you so much yael grushkacockayne and hope to encounter her again in other course	4

well done and deserves  stars although it was fairly basic as the title suggests its really just an introduction to the topic and as such its intended for absolute beginners you dont really need a background in engineering programming or anything of the sort to be able to keep up	4
generally this course has good subjects and syllabus in some parts of course they teach reasons of the subjects and it becomes more logical for me the only reason that i gave four stars is lecture videos are not enough for the final exam especially for part  of final exam some questions are more detailed for given lectures however it was a good introduction for music theory	3
a fine overview of many things  good in terms of knowledge	3
good overview of how to make graphs	3
great thanks to dr severance for making this process manageable and enjoyable	4
this course serves as a nice introduction to the field of computational neuroscience however at some points more than basic knowledge of differential equations and probability  statistics is needed	3

great course	4

this was an absolutely amazing course the material is great and the instructor is great i am only disappointed that the release of the week  course material was so significantly delayed that it prevented me from finishing the course i finished the first  weeks very rapidly with perfect grades then we waited so long for week  and even when it was finally released the assignment was not yet available so my life got busy again and now i wont get my certificate 	3
videos with guest speakers were unhelpful also quizzes were not accurate and poorly written questions	2
cons tests are too easypros interesting stuff though	3
great course	4
very good general overview of ml i put  stars instead of  because too much focus is made on graphlab for the hands on exercises the focus of this course is not on the tool itself however one should know that this is the primary library used for the exercises details are given for those who wants to use other library but the foundation of the course are clearly to present and showcase datos product	3
very good course	3
jedi mind tricks 	4

very well prepared material videos interviews further reading quizzes tests with many opportunities to dig deeper into the topic professor barbara oakley has an easy going but always professional approach with a great care for details and a tremendous ability to put them into the big picture and make learning fun and easy everything was really well curated and of high quality big contributions also come from dr terrence sejnowski which talks more about the neurological aspects related to learning i have learned quite a lot of interesting techniques that i can use to improve the way i study even if i am at the end of my phd  and not only techniques but also insights on how the brain works and how to relate this to the process of learning absolutely suggested to anyone interested in learning deeper and probably faster than before	4
intrestingthank u coursera	4

good course	4
great course professor zelikow puts into perspective facts that give us an understandable course of history and the role played by choices made by people rather than reviewing purely theoretical explanations or ideological trends to base conclusions really enjoyed it	4
fantastic course really comprehensive yet easy and pleasant to followjust a minor comment  id like that review criteria were more specific beforehand  i actually had lower grades in a couple of assignments due to review items that only showed up after submission	4
i thought this course could have been more engaging i quickly lost interest when the second course module repeated a large amount of content from the first modulei think a better overview or editing approach could have fixed that i also was disheartened with the just around the corner salespitch refrain in this course in your next course youll have access to it didnt help maintain my interest in the course i was taking currently	2
this was a wonderful course i would definitely take this again	4

disappointing the material is presented in such a way that it neither suits the mathematically inclined nor those interested a more handson introduction to neural networks some quizzes miss important figures and explanations so that they can only be solved with the help of other students that have access to previous versions of the courseif this course should run for another session the provider university of toronto should decide on the proper audience and should also considerably revise the course given the flaws with the current session it seems that the provider just wants to reap some easy money from students attracted by a current and interesting topic an a wellknown name geoffrey hinton	1
course was the worst i have taken on coursera i wish i could have received a refund the professors were hard to follow laughed through mistakes and did not do a good job of walking through the course content i would not recommend this course to anyone	0
perfect presentation for everybody	4
the technical support of this course is just terrible just like many many other students see the discussion forums i have experienced serious difficulties to access the databases platforms we need to learn and to complete our assignments i can only echo the innumerable complains from my costudents about the lack of efficient support and technical reliability of this course many of us are very unhappy about this especially as they have paid for this course  and what is coursera doing about it by the waymy advice beware before enrolling in this course and even in this entire specialization and search for alternative options there are many not only on coursera but also on edx and others 	0

helloim keith grimes and i just completed your course i really enjoyed the course and feel that ive learned quite a bit about learning i enrolled in the course simply because i felt it was time to take my love of the idea of learning and turn it into the practice of actually learning somethingwhat i loved most about the course was barbara oakley herself and her inspiring story i graduated from oakland university with a bachelors degree in english during those undergrad days i often experienced the impostor syndrome discovering that there was an actual name for what i often felt combined with the struggle to learn that dr oakley experienced in her younger years really connected with me thank you for sharingone other note i recently had the opportunity to share many of these ideas and concepts with my son who is a sophomore at michigan state university as dr sejnowski mentioned in the final video the measure of really knowing if youve learned something is to teach it to someone else sharing what i learned with my son in order to help him along his journey as a student was an invaluable experiencethanks again for offering this coursekeith d grimeshttpswwwlinkedincominkeithdgrimes	4

this course started out with an ambitious goal for a mooc in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project i found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on i still made an attempt to watch the course content but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance two stars for quality video production aside from that i was unable to find much value	1
thank you valeri and thanks to hec paris for this extraordinary and engaged leadership course	4
nice course for a preliminary understanding of game theory highly recommended	3

insightful and lively lectures manageable assessment tasks i would recommend this course to anyone	4
excellent thoughts and concepts presented	4
greatest course material ever and the professor is a great professor in deed rather than his knowledge in the field he has good a character	4

why i think the capstone project is a great thing how it brings the info from all of the previous courses in the social media marketing specialization together in one be picture basically in this project you take all the knowledge and tools youve been given and put them together which professor hlavac shows you very well how to do this step by step the excel spreadsheet examples you use are not difficult but might like overwhelming for newbie i would definitely use that tool for future social media strategies i honestly cant say enough for how professional and helpful professor hlavac is i wish they could clone him for other courses what an excellent communicator and im still amazed how quickly he responds to his students questions and remarks i admire his work and his approach to making me feel as if i am his only students where there are thousands that take this specialization im a little sad it over now i enjoyed learning the material and i will be proud to have a certification from northwestern university via cousera im also impressed with northwestern university from what ive experienced in this specialization also im sure i will refer back to the tools and the materials when working on a social media campaign	4
this course is an amazing tool for begginer programmers i have learned a lot	4
it is very important course for me it is very basic and useful for understanding the basic concept of pythonthank youdr chuck severance	4
good for beginners with little or no knowledge of python or programing	3
excellent course recommended for developers that want to know about machine learning and get to use it practically with real examples	4
very informative this is obviously now an incredibly complicated and important issuemy personal preference would to have a bit more science science and a little less social science among the topics	3
generally very solid interesting and well explained felt like the concepts being taught were definitely useful and i look forward to practising them	4
easy to learn	4
interesting course but here is the issue in miniexams there are very hard questions im passing them anyway but there must not be question those are not described in videos and in original papers of course there must be guessing questions too but not too much	2
in the last two weeks i have gained an immense amount of knowledge under dr severance thank you	4
much better than the previous version  with all concepts very well explained using examples to clarify them when necessaryi would have liked to go deeper with hadoop in last version of the specialization hadoop was a separate course but anyway as an introduction to big data this is an excellent course	4
its a great overview but somehow i didnt feel like it stuck even though i did put in effort to read the articles assigned starting halfway through the coursemaybe its because theres so much material that will be covered in a hands on part in the rd and th parts of this specialization would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in biotechnology and systems biology	3
great courses  well designed  explanations are clear and exercices and quizzes helps to have a better understanding  im really delighted and grateful to have acess to that course	4
great course	4
very useful	4
thank you prof charles and coursera for this wonderful course	4

alas after only  minutes of the first video i am reminded that this instructor does not gear his lectures to the true beginners among us he speaks much more for an audience of grad students i do want to complete this specialization so i will try again perhaps after learning more  about statistics and r and who knows what else i fought my way through the first three courses but now im going to work smarter by finding other ways to acquire this knowledge then return to him maybe this course should be labelled intermediate and statistics should be listed as a prerequisite i think since i dont know what it is that i dont know i am making a guess as to the missing piece of the puzzle	1
qick and easy learning process 	3
course help for people who want to be develop their career	4

wonderful python entry level course great course great professor charlesthanks all the people for the contribution to make this course successful	4
this is a splendid introduction to a delightful and powerful programming language for the firsttime programmer but its even more than that charles severance is a gifted teacher who gets the neophyte up and running in a gentle and engaging style really anyone can learn to program a computer and get a whiff of mastering technology but beware that whiff can lead to addiction and not in a bad way	4

great course the instructor provided insights into what makes a character interesting	4
i found it very usefulsome space for improvement are better coding skills naming variables andsome more complex topics like svd  pca should be explained in a more intuitive way	3
very informative but i think that if i hadnt already had a basic knowledge of the korean alphabet and grammar structure id have found the grammar explanations to be a bit too brief excellent for beginner level refresher though some glitches in the tests eg the correct answer being something not taught until the next lesson and the videos one lesson unable to be downloaded on any of the computers to which i have access would be good if this course had some social cultural lessons like how to drink in front of a superior	4
a sharp decline in quality and cohesion from the functional programming principles in scala course it may be worth enrolling just to hear oderskys elegant lecturing at work once again but if youre interested in the core concepts i would highly recommend picking up a highly rated book instead	1
loved this course	4
the course content is very good and easy to understand	4
many thanks for this wonderful course ive learn a lot with it	4
this course definitely teaches you to work smarter it is the simple changes that make this all possible this course however can be done in one sitting not sure if it can be called a course and i am not sure that i want to pay to get certified for taking it one little pet peeve i experienced was when the professor kept saying refer back that is grammatically incorrect you simply refer to something	3
good but very very basic	2
awesome course for people who wants to start their game development career	4
this course is quite good for basic introduction to machine learning field it is not for advanced learning but it is sure to get you started in a rocking way	4
learned a lot from python regular expression to open a file read url data web scraping http xml json	4
while i love dr van lents teaching style i was somewhat disappointed in the course as a whole after about the first week the instructor was not heard from again on the forums it wasnt until about the last week that some official teaching staff started to make an appearancethis was an issue as especially in the first week as there was a good deal of discrepancy between what was on the grading rubric what was provided in description for the homework and what was in an optional video that described the homework all with no official direction as to what was correct or how things should be properly graded the students were just left to themselves to try and interpret what the instructor meant and what was the proper thing to do in regards to the peer grading this continued albeit to a far lesser extent through the remainder of the coursewhile i dont expect instructors to be in the forums all that often i do expect them to clear up obvious issues and to make some type of official statement as to how students should proceed i believe this was the first offering of this course and i hope as it offered again those discrepancies are fixed and perhaps more official teaching staff are able to monitor the forumsas far as the material itself it is pretty good and covers most of the basics well as i said at the start i really love dr van lents teaching style she is very encouraging and easy to understand she is also very human making mistakes as she goes along and correcting them i feel this gives the student a good experience of the real world iterative process that coding is that even with experience mistakes are still made and to be expected and how to go about doing some debugging to correct those mistakes	1
just the beginning now but a really great one love the content the teachers videos are really well made and explanatoryi found the coursera platform really well fabricated and intuitiveeverything is set to give us the best chances to thoroughly learn and earn that awesome life changing license 	4
great course with efficient techniques and a lot of additional reading and videos	4

highly recommended	4
great material and very good explanations of the topics	4
taken this course in its old fashion style now reviewing the new design was a little bit displacing but i ascribe this to the fact ive done all the specialization courses in the old designhowever the structure of the course is quite good some typos were reported as well as a bug on the unanswered questions in quiz  main worst point was the missing format of several text boxes i would have appreciated paragraphs bold and italic some links picture not only raw plain textoverall review is nonetheless over the average	3

the method of teaching gives you a better understanding of why certain things in finance exist it goes back in history at times provides you with statistical data and the speakers are very knowledgeable in their own field because of that you become more aware of where finance was how companies and regulatory bodies operated before and where it might head to	4

i found this course to be dry no practical examples just information presentation like reading from a book the lectures do not prepare you very well for the quizzes and even less for the assignments this is the only course in coursera that really got me disappointed since there are not many students in this course one might feel a bit left alone	1
i have learned more about photography in the short few weeks than i have studying by myself in much more time great course	3
it was a very interesting course it gave me the basics on pmi wish to have more explanations on microsoft project tool maybe in the future	4
very good introduction to agile processes and practices	4
easy to undestand but it needs more examples	2
i am  i wish i knew about this when i was  it seems so obvious that because you learn anything you should learn how to learn this course should be mandatory for every kid or young adult everyone deserves to be equipped with better learning skills	4
best courses to learn python for anyone the educator has tried his best to make the course interesting and likable  i enjoyed it	4
awesome course	4
too hard to listen his english	0
this course is filled with interesting interviews thoughtful websites and papers all designed to help advance your understanding of	4
to me this is by far the best course in the series it deals with the scientific foundation of how to do data science regression models residuals measures of the quality of the prediction etc the teacher is clearly a mathematician and has an academic style of presenting he is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way one always understands what he or she is doinghighly recommended it doesnt get five stars only because it covers only the basics i would have really liked it to last twice as much	3
this course is about good practices for user interface design if this is what you are looking for it may be worth your time just be aware that the production quality of the videos is among the worst courses i have taken in coursera on the other hand if you are looking for a heavy cybersecurity related course i suggest you to stay away from this one unless you are taking the specialization in which case you dont have other choicecontent videos quality practicetheory ratio 	1
comprehensive course for beginners levelthe lectures are thorough with many examples and resourcesassignments are interesting with gradual level and lots of funvery recommended	4

the way this course is structured is really great which helps persons form non programming background to get involved and learn	4

nice and interactive courseeven takes subjective tests and helps get reviews from peers which is very constructive for a learner	4
it was great experience tour in the world of mathematics and modern algorithms i was very impressedthank you	4
very knowledgeable and impressivethanks	4
wonderful course	4
an amazing course content this is a very enjoyable course about python language programming dr chuck explains each topic with clarity which facilitate the comprehension of python from the beginning in my personal point of view i would like to have a more deeply exploration in topics it could give more tools to learn and complexity to each assignment the book as supported material is a very good resource for consult through all course	3
too theoretical eg comparison between statistics and ml is not at all useful too many quizzes after very short classes and on topics of absolutely generic things	1
great class i would recommend it to those who are interested in the topic	4
i enjoyed this course all the way it was challenging for me and extremely educative the knowledge accrued is already in use	4
the most robust course in this sequence it is well designed very clear teaches useful material effectively and is fun to take	4

although superficial it is a very good mooc for introducing lts testing	4
only in chinese not english subtitles	0
a great eye opener and excellently presented the rise of complexity as a driving force of development and evolution was a great learning point	4
way too basic probably only suitable for absolute beginners	1
excellent and interesting course on a very important topic very professional production and high quality lectures it was quite easy apart from the brain chemistry sections	4
the data document for assignment is a mess	2
i am in the process of applying for a phd that will entail developing a questionnaire de novo and this brief course has been immeasurably helpful in identifying components of questionnaire design that require careful consideration it is only a taster and there is certainly a lot more to read up on around the topic but it has provided a sound basis to grow on i would highly recommend it for anyone who is new to survey methodology or is even slightly interested in knowing how the design of surveys can influence results	4
thank you for this awesome course	4
very easy to use and very helpful happy im getting to take this course	4
good course	2
robert wright is if not the most eloquent person i have seen at least one of the most his lectures are clear and the subject is super interesting as far as the third week videos go i have not yet seen any statement from him that sounded presumptuous or extremely partial the way the lessons were organized and explained i believe were planned for the western people that sometimes may be a little more skeptical of subjects such as buddhism	4
well thought out and very useful information and training can be applied to any	4
great course interesting subject	4
a wonderful class for all the starters who really love programming	4
more on the history of seo rather than tactics	2
awesome class i really like this instructor he knows how to present well and give solid readings and information and i feel like i come away with actionable information i wish he taught all the classes in this course i would absolutely take more classescourses if he were presenting	4
i loved this course and enjoyed it	3
very clear and easy leads you on the track to the korean language	4
this course are excellent and thanks for prof for offering the course ive learned a lot from the course thank you	4
among my registered courses in the specialization this course is the one that should be invested with more effort from creators in order to give students more practical lessons regards	2
while a lot of useful ground was covered it was a constant struggle simply getting my environment to work properly  the entire specialisation needs to do a better job of getting users on a level playing field with better environment setup	1
excellent professor and extremely usefull materials for whose who are building new or growing existing companies	4
a great course to start learning about robotics	4
the course is very interesting and i like simply because it is very appropriate approach in this economic driven world to rethink about our planet and instigate a paradigm shift in thinking as i am from small landlocked himalayan country known as bhutan country of gross national happiness the course is very vital in achieving the objectives of our philosophical concept of gnh the course is excellent	4
the course is very valuable and i would recommend this course to anyone involved in sports my interest was mainly as an athlete but also as a parent of two very young children the insights gained for childrens training were actually very valuable as i am now more confident and comfortable to allow the child to develop their sport skills through early sampling the aim in this case is to support and instil in the minds of the children the benefits of being active and later on if they wish to do so enter a more specialised athletic path my comment with regards to how the course is run is that i would have preferred if it was a bit more interactive with  moderators i expected that the questions posed on the forum would have been answered but this was mainly not the case nevertheless i highly recommend this course	3
great course to learn internet of things	4
great im chemistry and this course is very useful to remember all things have you learnt in the university thank u	4
excellent course for begginers in philosophy enjoyed all the lecturers a lot	4
course is awesome i am planning to work on machine learning more and if course also guided some text book so that student can carry with them would be better	4
the course is very good and the instructors are very communicative the extra material is also very good you have the chance to listen to so many compositions which is very important in order to understand the touch of quartets personally i would like to have some more advanced lectures and to be provided with the music sheets of the great composers in order to analyse them and learn from them if curtis is planning to organise a more advanced course i would definitely join	3
i believe this is an excellent course because the fundamentals are explained in great detail the instructor conveys his knowledge in a very precise way i highly recommend this course for anyone who has a basic knowledge of web development because the last lectures can get a bit difficult for begginers	4
well worth the time spent becoming more knowledgeable about what goes into making a game	4
this course was great lots of extra information for added learning lots of review on all the concepts helps make them easier to rememberthe only thing i didnt like is that many of the questions on the quizzes were repeated several times and almost everyone question was had multiple answers	3
the course was well designed and specifically made to target every module with a significant importance	4
loved the knoedge and passion if the lectuerer and the student interaction	4
this is a really good course i was impressed some of the problems i hadnt seen before so it made the course interesting i had read a number of functional language books and thought this would be an easy give me but i wound up leaning a lot more than what i did from the books the course gave me a far greater understanding of functional programming	4
wow what a great course and a great lectureri recommend it for any one who find this subject interesting	4
it is good but a lot more citations and examples could be included	2
best course ever hugely exceed my expectations what i learned in this course will be very valuable in my future thank you andrew	4
great course and beneficial one	4
the course boosted my creativity i am now more confident in exploring and experimenting different things	4
difficult to follow	1
it shows the major tools to use in real life to program with r	3
short easy and practical advice on how to work efficiently	3
cool	4
great professor and i really enjoyed the basic building block approach it allowed me to learn slowly and completely while i took in all the new material this was the perfect course for me since i had no prior programming knowledge at all thanks dr chuckthe only suggestion i have is to provide more exercises to really cement the lessons similar to math class back in high school where you had to do multiple problems to see for yourself how different variations of the same types of problems work out although i may be alone in wishing for that	4
awesome courses	4
first two courses are awesome and really built the sense how to tackle real world problems like software engineeri have learnt a lot from these two courses and eager to learn something new in upcoming course i only knew very little about c and afraid from coding because i forgot syntax and couldnt built and fit logic correctly but after completing these two courses very good percentage in this specialization i feel comfortable towards any language this specialization is gateway for other languages for me it helps me to throw my hesitation in codingall teachers are good in delivering conceptalso the assignments and mini projects are really challenging  hence they polish concepts that teacher delivers in lecturesfurther more i really likes the shirts of drrobert i appreciate coursera and duke moocs teams for organizing this very novice friendly to expert course on javai hope and waiting for next serialization which leads from where this one left	4
excellent overview of ancient greek history very much enjoyed the lectures with clear explanations of different aspects of greek political military and social structure and the differences between the different polis reading material was enjoyable as well  appreciated the opportunity to read or reread in many cases herodotus thucydides and plutarch the mixtures of readings also gave the opportunity to view different persons and events from different perspectives which was refreshing i highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in ancient greece or the beginnings of facets of western culture	4
i am enjoying this course its helping me put my best foot forward	4
good course material needs more coverage in programming assignments for example monads and futures were not covered	3
the course contents are covered too briefly to learn anything useful too much breadth and insufficient depth	1
wonderful course  describing efficient basic algorithms	4
great course the videos are jampacked with information which makes it really worth your money and your time i am a selftaught designer and truly appreciated all the very specific tips and rules that are not as obvious when you start out on your own	4
it was a very helpful course thank you coursera team for this cheerful journey	3
fast paced and comprehensive also very good mentorship from the teacher	4
thank you a very interesting and enjoyable course	4
like the way the prof uses media this is a very light touch on a very deep subject so it has to balance analytical work with the light trust me and just do it approach the balance was mostly there although on a couple items i dont know that i had a good enough grip to know what i dont know	3
the course could be harder on us students to make some of us understand better and have a better practice	4
easy to understant the basic concepts of python including variables loops exception handler etc	2
needs more clarity	1
me gusto mucho	4
great course	4
this course was very helpful for me to know about the indicators that gives you the hint about how healthy the economy is  this course allowed me to read the news about economics how to interpret the figures mentioned in the news how good the policy makers are whether appropriateinappropriate considering the situation where the rest of the countries stand in todays world on top of it assignments and final exam made my understanding even deeper and precise thanks to ie business school and coursera platform for offering such a wonderful course for a begineer like me	4
this is a great course that provides many tips tools and tricks on how to make the choice of living a positivelife the professor presents an entirely new way of viewing simple everyday issues or life challenges that allowyou to persevere in a more peaceful less stressful way i am so happy to have taken this course	4

a little too basic but very well explained	3

its a great course	4
quit good but too easy	3
well designed  i especially like the way prof is explaining stuffs with very ease	4
the course was very informative and interesting wondering if its possible to get a certificate of accomplishment	4
amazing course i loved every minute of it the videos are well done helpful to understand the process and a big part of understanding each element the practice exercises are a great way to apply what i learned leaving feedback on my peers work was also very helpful it forced my mind to analyze the design in ways i was not used to ive am excited to keep on learningi would recommend this course to everyone	4
its a good basic level course which discusses on how to think strategically and approach for the real time problem at hand	3
at first the topic was not as concrete as i would like however after i got into the rhythm of the course and the more practical frameworks of the course and was more proactive about the coursework assignments and grading component i really am enjoying the course would highly recommend	4
its was an excellent learning experience and understanding my self awaearness	4

i really enjoyed this course gary burton is not only an excellent musician but also a great professor i recommend the course	4
very engaging course great projects and excellent presentation overall	4
wonderful course	4
i am very dissatisfied with how there was absolutely no outside helpfeedback from instructors or mentors in the forums when clearly the final project was outside the scope of the material presented in the future it would helpful if either the lectures were modified to be more helpful in completion of the final project or the final project to be reflected of material in the lectures either way i felt like i taught myself all of this material using web resources and got absolutely nothing for what i paid for	1
the course really helped me write essays better	4
great course excellent teacher	3
outdated materials theory is taught and then praxis is tested course needs an update to materials and either teach and test theory or teach and test praxis i passed this class by switching sessions multiple times in order to use the time to learn the practical skills in data visualization i needed to pass the testsadditionally the presented materials and the lecture format are very uninspiring	1
really exciting to go through the coursethere was something new to learn everyday	4
i simply love it learning a lotthank you	3
i really great course i really like it i found a lot interesting stuff from this course and i am able to understand the basic programming thanks a lot dr chuck	4
very interesting topics for projects and real executive from bombardier has reviewed my work it is good surprise	4
very useful course	4
its a bit hard to answer the quiz since the presentation is not speaking about the qu	2
good overview i appreciated that the course gets you set up and makes you prove it more command line and rstudio simple exercises would be nice	3
the main reason for my rating is because the course is so loose on what your are supposed to achieve incrementally every week that it can lead to some hard situationsjust to give my example the first week was piece of cake and i didnt feel like it really contribute for the following weeks then i was struggling with the suggested library tm until i got support through the discussion forums and someone suggested me to use quantedathen thinks started to run smoothly or so i thought when implementing the language model which at first i thought was supposed to be kbo i got stuck for a long period not because my model was wrong i was able to implement it and to check it against some handwritten and proved examples  which i should probably thank again but because i was not able to make it run efficiently enough for the given constraintsbeing stuck in this stage for longer than i wanted i had to sacrifice another important steps of data analysis pipeline in order to not jeopardize my final delivery by not meeting the final due date i know that this is exactly what will happen in the real life but i think that some better guidance could guarantee the students spent a more even amount of time in across all stepsall things considered i think the capstone was really interesting and likely took more than the  hours per week but most of this is probably because of the problems i facedi believe that with a better guidance on the paths to follow or maybe some suggested libraries to use a lot of noise useless difficulty could be removed and this course would definitely get more starts	2
awesome class	4
the course is really interesting but i believe the professor approach to describe and explain the topics is really confusing i had to search other resources to clarify the topics	2
it really help me a lot to have knowledge on data science with the tools we should be using	4

excellent course for students and researchers who want to start exploring systematic reviews and metaanalysis there some few minor problem with the materials also i wished there more advanced information regarding metaanalysis maybe you can develop an second course 	3
the training was simple to follow and easy to understand at times it was really too basic but then experienced programmers are perhaps not the intended audience in this case anyway good work and thank you	4
the teachers lecture is not very clear and all the assignments are graded by peer classmates which may occur several controversial issues	3
excellent course will highly recommend to any one leading a team	4
lectures are too long it lacks clinical correlationthe course focus only technical lab issues when you look for antimicrobial resistance course the last thing that you need is tech theory of course that some concepts are needed in order to provide fundamental basis but the main goal is and always will be how to interpret antibiograms and infere the most probable mechanism of resistance so there is a need for clinical correlation if its not present the course should be entitled laboratory methods for antimicrobial resistance	2
short videos with lots of useful tips	4

a very easy yet enlightening course doug is a great professorfunny too assignments were very easy and fun to do got a lot to learn in a short time great course	4
thank you so much	4
im not sure who this course was aimed at since there was a heavy use of technical vocabulary to describe many things someone with that level of vocabulary should know i already knew most of the course material but i learned some new things as well it would have been one star less but it being a short course which only took me a few hours to complete made me enjoy the experience more	3

i really enjoyed this course very fluid well organized and wellpresentin my opinion quizzes should not contain questions referring to the book because not everyone like me can afford buying iti would enjoy if prof sachs could go deeper in the topics and explore them a little bit more and make students job a little bit more difficult	3
this is definitely my favorite course on coursera and anywhere else in internet so glad i accidentally ran into it under a name that doesnt tell much about the content there is a real jewel  a multidisciplinary course that is truly able to connect many of the dots and make perfect sense of all these endless math and science history and many other classes we all had to sit throughout our school years i loved every minute of this course all the experts zooming into subjects all of additional materials especially crushcourse videos big history course is awesome for those always asking but why questions a very big thank you to the big history course team for finding time and passion for making it available to everyone in the world	4

 weeks was a bit of a rush to get everything done but the course was very informative and met expectations	3
this course was very well organized but i felt there were big jumps between the lessons within the modules i would follow fine up to parts  or  out of  or  total parts and then i would be lost i know there is quite a bit to html css and javascript and the professors did a great job to separate the components for a beginner i would have liked to spend a bit more time on html and css for full comprehension before delving into js	3
read book for supplemental material good overviews	4
its a wonderful course covers all the basic concepts of oop and provides the knowledge to develop an interesting and interactive applicationthe instructors have a student friendly teaching technique this has helped me a lot thanks to the staff of ucsd and coursera	3

this is not a class i would normally pursue i took it as part of the data mining certification that being said this class was wonderful i learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines i went from knowing nothing to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work it was a challenging course for me but very much worth the time and effort i put into it it was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind google netflix and amazon searches and that has made me think of the world in a different way i am now a human happily collaborating with machine learning systems thank you	4
this course taught me a lot and i am now on my way to learn advance python i am really happy i saw this course and took it i am looking forward to more courses in this category from the university of toronto thanks for this excellent course	4
great teaching methodology  although the test are a bit too centered on number crunching and not reasoning a lot of number crunching and no room for little numerical mistake although reasoning is good	2
very poor teaching extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested and what is not they assume that you know terminology and concepts that are not taught half of what they show you are told to ignore obviously smart and capable researchers but teaching the lay person is not their strong point	0
great introduction even for people who will not pursue completion of the full specialisation	4
i would like some input from the instructors on all the graphic design specialization courses	3
excellent course the material presented was not difficult to comprehend i highly recommend this to parents who are in a quandry every night when the question whats for dinner presents itself more than the content i was most impressed by the manner in which the course was taught instead of a talking head format the instructor used a variety of techniques to present the material including teaching the majority of the class from her kitchen using an interactive blackboard to illustrate concepts while she spoke and lots of cooking demonstrations kudos to stanford for producing such high quality content i have started a lot of coursera courses and this is the first one that ive been able to complete because the content kept me engaged	4
good overall presentation of core algorithms and ideas	4
i really enjoyed this course and got a lot of useful information out of it much food for thought as well as fun dinner conversation i also found it to be very useful in my personal life	4
it was really helpful for me	4
powerful this course opened my eyes to somethings that were maybe obvious but whose deep and real meaning i never rationalized beforethis course is taking method to studying and supporting said method by science the instructors are pleasantly easy to follow they make the subject accessible to all students even to those for whom english is not the first language and content is just the second obstacle to overcomeyou have procrastination mathscience learning issues this is just your course	4
excellent presentation of the different theories related with second language acquisition	4
as i only interested in learning sql i did learn a lot quickly	4
the exercises lead you to the edge of a cliff then push you off no guidance good luck if you dont already know linear algebra matrix math and matlab ill be looking elsewhere to learn about machine learning glad i didnt pay for this course	0
the course content is very useful but explanations are short and its unclear how to install r studio for the windows i found it at youtube also i had a problem how to install the r packages and solution was simple you should run it as administrator it wasnt in lecture	3

its really a wonderful course thank you charles	4
this course is the most wonderful and special course i have ever taken	4
this planning course was slightly better than the preceding landscape course but it was still underwhelming the instructor seemed better prepared with her presentation but her dependence on the textbook and speaking style still made it seem as if she lacked mastery of the subject the course did touch on the important subject matters at hand but since the textbook was so old practically outdated by digital media standards it missed or made little mention of so many innovations and best practices that are now the rule for digital marketers for example the increasingly crucial role of marketing automation platforms like hubspot dynamics marketing and marketo and how crms like salesforce and dynamics are driving both marketing and sales strategy another example is how email marketing has moved to rulesbased and triggered workflows again theres a definite need for this course i would actually recommend breaking out social seo and online advertising into their own courses rather than squeezed into small segments finally the putting it all together section is vital for anyone who wants to work in digital marketing but the coverage here was much too general	1
love this course am going to suggest to all my students and clients that they take this coursenurse courtney	4
its a great course clear explanations and simple videosthe missing star was lost on the way that misleading or undefined bias are presented especially during the different decision phasesi would like to propose to discuss a case of a stock share in a timeline to see whether this panic or overconfidence applies and also in global macroeconomics eg the pigs bubble the debt bubble	3
poor presentation of topics i dont recommend	1
it is a pretty good course but maybe its too basic for people that has already worked with some other languages	4
its very helpful for a beginner	4
leaning so much	4

fresh new approach to change and the perception of change	4

now this is a course to spend time learning its very well prepared in terms of material its useful and fun and it provides ready to use skills i can immediately apply to my websites	4
the course is a good overall approach to humancomputer interaction it teaches how to do participan observation interviewing storyboarding and heuristic evaluationhowever i would say that some of the assignments were too simple in terms of complexity and there was few opportunities to apply the theory in the assignmentsin general i found the course useful for people who want to learn more about how understand better customer necessities for design in general	2
a very useful and inspiring course	4
this course was okay but projects required much more in depth information than the course materials provided	3

such an insightful and inspiring course that truly and utterly changed my perspective not just of learning but of life thank you barbara and thank you coursera	4
its a basic machine learning course for new learners who want to explore what machine learning is this course is a setup for the rest of the specialization and requires various guided programming exercises covering the most popular ml algorithms	4
machine learning is a complete course about the mathematical techniques to make computers learn by themselves in this course you will study the rationale behind mathematical algorithms and learn how to translate it into computation languages such as octave or matlab warning the course is fastpaced and requires some intermediate level on calculus programming and algebra you will be able to pass the course even if you are not pro at that but it will be hard	3
awesome course to get the hands wet on python	4
very educative with the knowledge i have gained from this i feel ive come out with much more than just valuable notes	4
i like the course i think it is complete	4
its really helpful	4
it paved the way for my programming learningexcellent course  recommended	4
this course was great from beginning to end it woke up this creativity in me that i havent seen since i was in freshmen year of high school	4
awesome course	4
great course learned a lotwould have liked more practical exercises rather than premade scripts that we edit	3
it is indeed very instructional i really learned a lot with each assignment some have been easy and some have been hard to work but in the end everything is well explained	4
nothing is making sense none of the videos are related to the quiz none of the examples are remotely related to the quiz to even give you a suggestion on how to solve them	0
it would be helpful if the instructor didnt talk with his hands the lectures and materials are well done there are a few typos here and there good course	4
very rewarding with easy to understand but comprehensive lectures and optional exercises that can be done with each subsection of the lecture these exercises were interesting relevant and challenging it was also educational to do the peer reviews and see how other students approached the assignmentsthe instructions for assignments perhaps could be broken into bullet points as sometimes they were perhaps not fully understood on the optional exercises some guidelines to help give more substantial or constructive feedback beyond this met the assignment criteria or i liked  could be helpfulim very glad i did this course and i was thoroughly engrossed in the exercises it was sad when the course ended 	4
useful course with nice projects	4
the assignment is creative and very brilliant and lessons is very short it is a pleasure to learn from you	4
super useful but i think it should have more chemical about the reactions of food in our bodies	3
this course is enlightening  i learned things about how my own brain works that i would have never come up with on my own i imagine tha i will benefit greatly from this course in my further studyingi recommend this course for anyone who ahs issues with test taking or wants to get even better results on their test taking	4
i feel the contents of this course were great no second thought on it it makes your concepts crystal clear but faced lots of issues during practicing the hands on exercises and did not get proper feedback or response on any of the queries	2
i really appreciate these series of courses i want to thank prof provart and his coligues for their great job on preparing and presenting these series thanks a lot	4

excellent presentation of material at the right level i found this course helpful reinforcement to what i know but dont put into practice after this i will do better	4
the subject of the course is extremely interesting and useful for learners on the presentation front i feel it could make better use of technology some pp slides more colorful examples it effectively provides the students with some very important concepts and techniques to improve the process of learning therefore i still give it a star rating	4
great course	4

very important for every working person to understand and apply	4

i think this course has very interesting information but it needs a way better format it needs agile presentations better infographics graphics and design and to be much more flexible and funi have not finished it but it does not make me get involved in the content even it is very interestingit needs a better script and handling of the information to be able to conect with new students	0

you must use the exact format to get the correct answer on problems or it will be marked wrongthe course is as is meaning when there are mistakes in the coursework neither web hosting nor faculty have are available to correct mistakesmoderators are not allowed to correct course content so what they end up doing is editing your post in the forum get use to this a moderator deleted your post in calculus one because of spamreview our forum code of conduct to learn more about guidelines for participating in course discussions but i and others are only posting problem areas thus rendering the forum discussions uselesssince the moderators only have the power to delete and edit your post there is a list of content errors for the course that you will need to look at real smart i asked to have my grade adjusted but they deleted that post also	0
fantastic course im not very good at actually completing moocs something about not having to answer to anyone i suspect but the reviewing of classmates work was done nicely enough pressure to mean the assignments actually got done without requiring an unreasonable amount of time douglas is a fantastic teacher and really inspiring the course has revitalised my writing in just the way i needed	4
very important course of the interaction design specialization nicely crafted assignments you will add value to the company you are working for by taking up this course amazing faculty	4

great class	4
i have completed this coursera in one day	3
i never had a programming class that covers really the base of the basics in such a deep and easy to understand way not taking for granted many things professor charles severance has a great sense of humour it looks like you are talking to him in person its not something spectacular for the camera and very generous showing his team amplifying knowledge through interviewing many interesting people exercises were very helpful to understand the chapters would appreciate if could have more exercises not for grade but for practicingsuper recommend it	4
great for beginners and people needing a reminder on the theory	4
i really enjoyed this course colleen is a great teacher easy to follow her teachingsit was a good start to learn webdesign	4
excellent introduction to excel i could revise my knowledge and i learned some new formulas videos are very helpful and explanation is clear i strognly recommend this course	4
this is an excellent course the instructors are very likeable each module follows the same outline  build intuition with simple graphs  introduce the matrix operations geometrically with some clever graphics  a rigorous mathematical discussion  playing with the functions in an ipython notebook especially focusing on hyperparameters  implementing the regression equations in your choice of programming language as much as i love andrew ngs machine learning course you could take this sequence instead and get more explanation with the same mathematical rigor	4
very little useful information more like pr for pwc	0
good course i would recommend it to others	3
i am learning a lot from this course i have always wanted to learn hangul my goal is to actually watch a kdrama without the english subtitle p	4

lectures are quite simple and short but i really enjoyed working on homeworks its a great and short course to start generating game ideas	3
great course the content might be improved to be more clear i feel that sometimes the instructor assumes we are familiar with some concepts we have not seen in previous courses also some times he does a very good job explaining the why before the how and some other times he does not very knowledgeable instructor	3

a nice and flexible course in which you can explore the wide range of possibilities from the minimum basic level of subject to studying all the additional material and problematics rather interesting functional approach to the structure of philosophical knowledge for the foreigners as i am the english is quite understandable it is subtitled but the subtitles are not necessary if you are above b  ielts  level and at the same time sufficiently sophisticated to acquire also some useful listening practice for academic ielts  pte academic tests	4
excellent material for teachers on how to develop a solid lesson plan aligned with the class objectives	4
another great class really gets you thinking i doubt i will unlearn anything from this course good stuff	4
professor sachs discussion as well as the course materials were sufficiently encompassing and thoroughly researched the course presented a good overview of the climate change problem as well as how humanity can overcome these obstacles through sustainable development	4

very helpful i will apply what i learned to m	4
nice class to start learning programming or to sharpen your early programming skills funny teacher too five stars for mr severance	4
i am a research student and working with matlab programming currently previously i did masters in geography and i had a very little experience in programming language as my entire course study was based on theory statistical applications in geographydr chucks lectures really helped my out to learn coding from scratch and at the top of it i am now able to find out my loopholes while i do coding on matlab background definitely i will take more courses from coursera in future and when i have saved much i will upgrade my course to get my completion certificatescheerschandrama	4

a very good starter on machine learning very well taught awesome videos practical use cases and intriguing programming exercises highly recommend for anyone looking to step into a future in ml had great fun completing this course	4
i heard about this course from an uncle of mine i somewhat hesitant and reluctant to do this course fearing its difficulty level but once i started it things were greatly simplified due to the great course content as well as the superb teaching of professor andrew ng i believe that the programming assignments could be made more difficult as in us having to do everything from loading the datasets to plotting the learning curves apart from applying the learning algorithms	4
i wish i had had access to this course years ago it not only improves the way you learn so you learn more deeply but it reduces the amount of time you would spend studying without necessarily improving your understanding or retention of the material	4
nice platformmost of it i found there are many feature at single platform	4
very good course	4
the material presented was of course useful but i never really felt like i understood how it all tied together or what the big picture was i think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpfulalso as a suggestion i feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture	2
computer system internals hardware and software architectures concept of abstraction divide and conquer method the fun of building hardware and the fun of writing programs all combined into this course in an organised way i cant think of a better course and a better teaching	4
went over many aspects of the law and learned a lot from helpful videos and reviewing what peers wrote just have to be careful that your peers do not copy and paste for answers	4
always love your courses dr chuck you make them so much fun and easy	4
i really liked this course however i would rather to have more help in the ftp or cpanel part and more coding aswell	3
this has augmented impact it takes you through positive psychology contents smoothly to train you and absorbs the concepts and theories in one to one classroom environment and simultaneously puts you on the way to change and inculcate the positive attitude by enhancing the awareness at inner level thanks for the course one should also go for certificate since it is not easy to get the same and that adds value to it henceforth when an applicant would submit coursera certificate i would certainly give weightage at par with traditionally earned university certificate	4
great course for beginners highly recommended	4
more examples can be included and if assignments are in python that would be helpful as most of the high level frameworks are in python and that will build good ground work in numpy etc	3
great intro level course	4
this is a wise course which helps with goalsetting and spiritual direction	4
extraordinarily basic entire thing can be done in about two hours	1
very good course stressing at times i very much liked charles good at teaching	4
its my first coursera certification course prof david taught us all the core concepts in a easy way with solid practical sessions all the quiz helps us to recall what we learn on those weeks looking forward to learn more 	4
this course is great its so useful	3
good alternative for andrew ng course in russian good level but some difficulties with tasks submission	4
exceptional overview that presents a big picture that motivates detailed study	4
very informative well structured a lot of important information provided in a limited period of time	4
very interesting	3
pretty simple stuff  but wouldve been better if there was actually something we worked on in a group or an actual project to plan or gantt chart to create	2
interesting	4
great course	4
ive taken several different online python courses completing some and not others this one works for me the interactive aspect allows you to see the results of your coding graphically other courses tend to start with theory and basic concepts detached from practical application or illustrated in isolation this course has you applying the basics that make simple actions happen programs in their interactive interpreterif youre like me and have tried the other courses by mit edx udacity those offered on stackskills codeschool pluralsight codecademy et al this one rises to the top because of the balance of academic instruction and graphical interactivity and despite the lame jokes just kidding guys	4
very interesting	4
this course has given me a foundation to work with gis and the program license alone is worth more than the cost of the course the instructor nick santos clearly loves his work and that makes the lectures more fun to watch	4
this is the third course i have taken from dr chuck and i have loved them all his teaching style matches my learning style and i find python to be an easy to learn and easy to use language	4
average doesnt really like the professors style he spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc i feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject i would have prefer a more historical approach overall ive watched all the content but in the future i wont spend much time checking for new mooc from him thanks for the try though	2
complicated subject made easier to learn thanks you prof andrew ng	4
a very helpful course it acts as a perfect accompaniment to the existing knowledge of any health professional	3

this course was very well designed and easy to follow i would recommend it for anyone who is involved with the development of applications no matter what what their role	4
the course was informative but seemed to be geared towards individuals not accustom to survival situations i would enjoy taking a more advanced in depth programhowever the course was clear and i enjoyed the assignments some of the quiz questions were based off of information which may have meant more to the instructor than it was significant to the students	3
this course was more specific and actionable than the theory course it fulfills its mission well the readings are excellent i printed several to use for my own blog and content marketing effortsthough competent the instructor is lackluster frequently just reading from the slides the substance is good but the style is dry	3
very well put together course 	4

very interesting motivating and full of tipps tricks and learning know how thank you very much for this course	4
colleen understands the struggles most of the students will have and addresses them in a effective manner she explains the material in a way that is enlightening to novice and yet interesting to more experienced	4
again like in getting started with python course i wish there was a way for us to get explanations for quiz questions after we complete a quiz so we can fully understand them i wish we could have something similar for when we complete the coding assignments the worked exercises are helpful but it would be helpful after we complete an assignment to have a code to compare ours to to see the differences and to make sure we understand exactly what dr chuck was getting at there were several assignments that i completed but not in the correct way so the next weeks assignment was more difficult than it should have been	3
great courseit will cover all the basic concepts of wireless communications with in a small timethank you for team  coursera for keeping this course online	4

i advice not to take this coursewhy the professor is never there to read your assignments he leaves that totally to other students like yourself to grade your written assignments and they do not read and give you a random grade in  secondsdont take it you will waste sooo much time on this one	0
good course can be better in terms of information and assignments	2
the course is really nicely done also for nonamericans it is interesting even though a lot of background knowledge might be missing but you have to be aware it is really more focused on the ideas of jefferson and less on all the discussions and fights he had with his fellow statesmen at that time i would have wished to learn also more about those	3
absolutely focus on project management	4
horrible experience as a student no moderator or the faculty replies to your queries the instructor has just left the course to take its own accord it is frustrating to get such a response when you have paid a hefty much for the course	0

very clear and detailed i made and launched a game	4
very clear and concise exercises and quizzes were very educational	4
similar to other courses in this specialization the material is very nice although slightly easy and straightforward but the course instructors do not moderate the discussions enough to make them a useful tool especially when im paying for the specialization i would appreciate responses to my questions	0
fair course severance is a good lecturer but necessary to read all notes and the book chapter in addition to the lecture in order to understand the principles learned a lot from the course	2
great course i learned a lot just one thing id like to see more clearly is that during the course all annual interest rates are converted into monthly rates just dividing by  later i learned this means they are nominal rates given that in the real world most rates tend to be expressed as effective rates it would be good if this issue was expressly addressed	4
in general a good course well presented start only due to some assignment questions not being covered in lectures	3
this course will make you write a script and thats it if you want to learn how to write a script dont take this coursethis course just push you to write a script without clearly teaching you what to do if you want to learn look for another course i took one from futurelearncom while in this course its free this one is a waste of money if you pay	0

great intro really gave me confidence with the daw	3
i did learn a few new things but i would have to say the course is very easy to pass the hardest part is the essay questions but these are optional anyone having basic knowledge of egyptian history could pass all the quizzes without doing anything else you only have to get  correctthe recorded lectures were good but not great the speaker is reading the transcript and it seems like for the first time he is not speaking naturally and its a bit stiffnevertheless for someone just starting the course has all the essential information needed and you will learn a lot	3
good course	4
since i am a visualaudio learner being able to see and hear the material really helps me understand what i am reading this course has been very helpful to me learning and understanding machine learning topics	4

this is one of the best cs courses ive taken so far its great to see how easy it is to build a simple yet powerful computer on your own and it has given me for the first time the feeling of really understanding whats going on at the low levelthe complete course is centered about the project of building a computer so there are no quizzes and only few theoretical background lectures here if you want a handson introduction to computer engineering this is the way to go	4

great course the only bad thing is that in the end the course does not provide a certification	4
a great course though its recommended that you have some basic experience in linear algebra before taking it	4
the course is really nice and easy for beginners of english grammar	3
super useful i would recommend to go thru all four courses in the way they are structured so student more clue of what are teachers talking about but construction financing is crucial part to understand how industry works and this course explains that very wellthank you	4
briliant and up to date	4
explanations are very clear perhaps my only discomfort is related with the usage of matlab or octave for the programming assignments instead of more modern languages	4
its really an interesting course for me when comparing with those very complex and boring courses and books in this area this one helps me to understand more about how all these algothems really work when we are applying them than you very much for providing this course	4
assume class you explore a lot of dinosaurs including many weird newly discovered ones plus you explore the variety what characterizes different types of birds	4
i have some suggestions use consistent english throughout the course due to this is an english class one upload button is enough in the assignment    so it doesnt confuse people specify the minimum grade to pass the assignment if it  then say    however overall the course is good and i love learning other culture kind of a new experience for me thank you very much _ xie xie   	2
not useful by itself but grudgingly necessary to get you ready for subsequent courses in the specialization	2
great class thanks dr ng and the coursera team	4
awesome courseone will learn tech as well as bit of theorywill help devs a lot	4
i have learned a lot from this course i appreciate the good instruction from professor skyhorse as well as the encouragement constructive advice and critique from my lovely classmates 	4
the best course taught by the best teacher	4
a good intro into java as this is part  of the specialization i would have liked to have seen a greater introduction into more of javas collections than just string manipulation and csv using an apache lib	3
interesting though instructors participation and help could have been more noticable the course has way many blank gaps and question and all these questions are clarified by students  each with his own understanding i think the instructor must be a person to answer all the question about the course thanks	3
awesome introduction to big data aimed at complete rookies	4
interesting course i reccomend it for people who want to knew some valuable information about history of design it start from xix century and move to xx century but not to the end it would be great if you will made a new course with new era of design with internet and modern devices	4
great course i recommend	4
although i gave  stars but the background music in the video lectures is really irritating	4
easy to understand  useful knowledge 	4
awesome course learnt a lot	4
an extremely wellstructured and useful course as someone who had only syntactical familiarity with python this course taught me a great deal about the ease and power of the language moreover the technical knowledge included apis regex etc is highly relevant and practicalgiven that its part of an introductory series the difficulty level of the assignments is understandable but providing some more rigorous optional assignments can be a welcome addition to the coursethat being said i would recommend it to anyone looking to explore python and the power it grants with its simplicity	3
it is good but for an introduction its too long	1
really very good course	4
great must read	4
i really enjoyed the course and think it is very well thought out and paced i appreciate the access to additional reading materials	4

still a very interesting course but a few technical problems with test and forums	2
this was the best course i have taken so far very informative the right balance between theory and lots of practice prof siedel is a real expert and a great teacher as a psychologist with no background in law or economy i struggled at times with course material this however made me even more motivated to go through lectures once more and i was able to understand everything even better than after the first try elm street exercise and the debrief afterwards were the best thank you coursera for this course greetings from zagreb croatia 	4
love it	4
halfway through this course and finding it relevant practical useful enjoyable  i cant recommend it enough	4
thanks for a great course	3
the course is ok but i found that there were some technical quirks that could be ironed out first example is to download the text files in the final assignment the command wget is invaluable how to leave safe mode if the name node is in safe mode virtualbox is default to  bitubuntu when the image is  bitcentosredhatin addition the course content is a bit little it says  weeks but i finish it in  days perhaps it is about quality and not quantity	2
this course not only teaches you ebola but you will also learn how is it to be in the area with epidemic besides teaching the health aspect you will get to learn even more it is a must for anyone of medical background 	4

a great course	4
simply awesome	4
excellent mooc prof van oostendorp has done a wonderful job asking students and colleagues to intervene extremely interesting	4
the only reason this excellent course does not have five stars is because of the technical issues that are the responsibility of coursera and the failure of some of the peers to write peer reviews according to the instructions i heartily recommend this course to anyone seeking to kick start revive or tune up serious writing	3

great course for people who are passionate about geography and geology	4
it is a good launching point towards further concepts in neural networks  deep learning algorithms the course is at the right level of challenge and right level of introducing notions and conceptsside reading  learning is strongly recommended for audiences from the quantitative field without exposures in machine learning	4
wounderful course congratulations	3

excellent course logically put together and well presented it raises multiple issues some of which we were aware of but had not addressed and others which we had not even considered	4
pretty cool course i hope they come out with two course sequences one based more on theory that doesnt back away from stochastic calc so much and another on practical methods using something other than excel	3
i thought this one was better than the first two parts short selfpaced to the point easy to follow and implement highly recommend this one all i wanted is actually the json part but i got so much morequizzes and assignments could be an itch more challenging	3
good content and nice explanations the assignments might need a bit of clean up and couple places the algo mentioned does not work as intended	3
a fairly basic class but still very interesting	4
i really like this course and i hope that more	4
really great i wish i had spare cash for the certificate version	4
fun engaging and clearly explained	4
just awesome	4
not as good as the regression course but still very goodwhile i appreciate prof guestrins enthusiasm i missed a little rigor and mathematical depth of the regressions course by prof foxi learned a lot but i feel that regression clicked with me a little better than classificationbut thats probably mein either case the whole series are awesome so far better in my opinion than anrdrew ngs ml course on courseraa small suggestion would be to switch the main toolset from the graphlab to something more common like scikit learn and pandas	3
very interesting topic but even for an introductory course not nearly enough to justify a full  week course for  the first course fundamentals of graphic design had more content more optional assignments and covered typography too	2
the project is too unguided you can set an example by creating a sample website throughout the course	2
very interesting course and well organized and presented it is a great opportunity to apply your creativity 	4

i didnt know how to write good poems this course has taught me how thank you	4

very good course	4
awesome course	4
a great continuation of the former courses continues in the same line that the other and you really keep growing in your python knowledge	4
a few last lectures future try lack pretext or at least appear somewhat out of order unless one is familiar with the topic generally higher score  out of  or  out of  could have been made a little harder to get adding a couple of extra optional problems for one point each could be a good idea	3
outstanding courseeverybody must take it from dialy to weekly and weekly to monthly yo get the things done by following simple and strigthforward activities	4
starts slow for someone who is interested in learning programming but after a few chapters you realize how important it is to learn the first few simple thingsteacher is very good at transmitting concepts and highly entertainingcourse is excellent	4

wonderful and intellectual professor	4
great course for beginners in graphic designyou get to know the basic and the tasks are simple so anyone can do themno previous experience is needed but its fun to try and make your own designs	4
this is the history course i should have been taught at school	4
this course is awesome dr oakley has taught many helpful skills on how to learn but for me the most important and most helpful thing is that you are not born to become who or born to be specifically proficient in some subjects as long as you learn with right methods you can learn anything for long ive been trapped and handicapped by the einstellung that im not a math or physics learner now im completely confident that all i need is to walk away from the comfort zone and learn efficiently with those useful and scientific methods many thanks to coursera and the course team thank you	4
awesome class definitely five starts	4
effective use of time jumped into useful things immediately	3
excellent course it would be awesome to have more advanced topics covered in future courses if its ever in your plans ie lateral torsional buckling strain energy fatigue composite material failure theories anisotropic materials local stresses due to bolts bolt groups etc you are the man	4
great i got a lot thanks	4
its really a quick intro into agile software product management	4
i have a masters degree and until i took this mooc i had somehow gotten used to the ridiculous notion that i had learned everything that i needed to know i am pleasantly amazed at how much i still dont know and i am very excited to learn more i have even started reading journal articles by page and zellner because i am very facinated by the models shown to me in this coursethank you very much for making this material available	4
the quality of this course is very low and the content are not interesting and useful at all	0
i loved loved this course and really enjoyed it though i didnt see the last feedback from other students on my final project bookishness and it is locked now however it is an amazing course and very useful	4
i like it very very much i would like to recommend this course to all of my friends	4
the final course in the specialization we have to learn to use our skills to do projects less of coding and more application of knowledge we can choose to quickly get a certificate or immerse in the experience	4
it was my first experience with coursera and after it im addicted to continue learning i highly recommend this course	4
i love how the professor used analogy to help student understand how python perceives code	4
great way to introduce and simple ways to learn the basics of the language recommended for all none programmers to start with	4
best introductory course on machine learning possible	4
great course teachers and examples i highly recommend this course	4
this course and the others of the specialization made me thinking of nothing else than photographing in the past monthsweeks i am learning so much from here and it makes me eager to know much more and to investigate on different sites for further details and lessons thanks to all of you at msu who have helped in setting up this lessons	4
great class to take if youre a beginner or more of an advanced writer to refresh your learning on the subject love how i also got to learn about the editing and publishing process as well definitely would not have minded if the class were a few weeks longer very glad i signed up and took this course i am more motivated to continue my life as a writer	4
awesome course well done barbara and terry	4
awesome course	4
totally fascinating course very interesting and very good base to continue lerning	4
i managed to learn things i didnt knew before althought thinking upfront that i have that knowledge already thank you	3
this continues dr chucks easing into python its a great course for beginners but you should definitely augment the class with reading the book rather than just keeping it as a resource the existence of the book is noted in the videos but it isnt really stressed which is unfortunate as its helpful about the only thing id appreciate would be more exercises to develop mastery rather than just familiarity	3
cool but short	4
this is a very good course for many people from engineers i am one myself to economists and policy makers there is always something usefull also the classes are fun to watch i had a great time and learned a great deal thanks	4
useful information indeed but still running into some disconnects between the course material and the tests which is definitely very frustrating	3
a fantastic foundation in sustainable development well structured lectures and set at a good pace recommend getting associated book as its good to refer back to	4
hes awesome	4
great acceleration of the specialization compared to the first course it covers modern approaches as mapreducefilter implementation in purrr nicely explains debugging benchmarking oop etc i would recommend this as a kick starter for more advanced r programming	3
yaakov explained the positioning element is easy to understand and also on the javascript part he summarised what the recommended book javascript and jquery by jon duckett does is also easy to understand i am very impressed his actual visit to the restaurant to do the requirement elicitation technique too	4
very good course	4
great course and it is really a good chance to study it well under kollers instruction	4
i loved learning the course	4
this course give a lot of precious advice and insights into efficient learning it is definitely worth the time	4
i signed up to audit the first  courses in this specialization this review is for the first  of these courses taught by rebekah mayi dont know that seo is truly simple and logical or if it just appears this way because of how clear and easy to listen to ms may is i do feel she has supplied a lot of very useful information pointed to a lot of great tools and websites and am already making improvements as a result of her classes	4

the course presents the topics in a nonlinear manner it should be called learning graphs with c	2
very useful and clear thanks	4

wowintroduction to software product management is best	4
excellent learning program thanks	4
great teaching very interesting course easy to understand thank you	4
i am sad to see after accomplishing  weeks course there wasnt any certificate given	3
i find this course excellent it is a well balanced course in combining econometric theory and its application the fact is that to apply econometric theory one needs to understand fair bit of econometric method that includes matrix algebra some properties of inner product space etc as well as how to apply those concepts in practice in this respect this course does serve its purpose very welloverall this course focuses some fundamental aspects and properties of crosssectional data and time series data therefore it provides one a good foundation over  weeks so that one can carry out ones future quest regarding any empirical topic by oneself  i admit that modern econometric theory develops more sophisticated techniques but all of them share one common aspect ie they are based on more or less the same fundamentals or properties indeed this course has been designed carefully by targeting those fundamentals and properties thus it might be very helpful to follow the modern econometric techniqueshowever this course does not talk about the panel data analysis which share both the crosssectional and time series properties more or less in my opinion it might be better to have at least additional one week session on panel data in particular when the data set shares both crosssectional and time series properties which set of properties will be dominant or how the estimation technique incorporates the variation of two dimensions ie crosssectional and time  etcfinally i like to thank all the teaching members and moderators of this course i have enjoyed the lecture slides and videos very much	4
stepic issues with not syncing progress and assignment completion all else was good well paced	3
this course is the greatest of math	4
really wonderful high level overview quite helpful for me	4
easy to understand and the course is very well made	4
extremely useful and relevant for todays technology	4
very interesting and innovative i highly recommend	4
a useful overview but i think this course tries to be too many things all at once it would have been better to break the philosophy the ethics and the science of emotions into separate courses there is a lot of confusion and oversimplification in the considerations of consciousness and self awareness and the implications of those things for emotions in humans that would i think have had a better treatment if the prof had pruned out some of the other stuff perhaps ethics or artificial intelligence for example	2

learning and fun packaged together nicely its definitely challenging but all the info is explained in detail with downloadable videos and through email communication thank you for all the hard work to make this so streamlined	4
this course is almost the final one for the specialization taught by prof kaul it is a little redundant with the rd course of the specialization however it is still of great quality format and content as the other courses wereit allows you to apply courses  in close to real life contexts the exams are very interesting and module  of this course made me want to go further into valuation problems i encourage to take courses   and  before this one	3

simple yet powerful	4
it definitely was a bit hard but the realtime applications that duke university always uses to elaborate programming applications stole the show the csv file access and dna data processing via java was a fun to learn	4
this course gives general information on the magic of middle ages however i wish the course could be arranged in a more logical and coherent way such as geographical or chronological which will help to understand and memorize material in week  is very confusing it is hard to get the key points from those materials and what the instructors want to tell me on the other hand materials in week  is easy to be understood and reflected in the first written assignment	3
this is a great course randy explains in easytounderstand steps how to initiate an integrated marketing communications program and how to track and test your efforts he also does a nice job of explaining why certain steps are important and provides several valuable case studies to top it all off several guests appear in his lectures providing additional insight and realworld examples	4
really great course	4
great course and great instructor d	4
this course is pretty good the most good part is that it includes academic learning and handson practice	4
a very useful start to programming in general	4
great coursethanks professor	4
boring	1
i think the teacher was very welcoming but the content was less than enough to answer the quizzes in the quizzes every answer choice was correct and there wasnt any possible way to discern what the teacher said and complemented with the lectures didnt match with the question answers so my score is 	1
i had fun thats a good sign there is something to take away from this course for everyday living so that is good tooperhaps i was expecting a bit more research discussions it seemed all nice with the chats but maybe less pedagogic than i might have expected	3
i really liked it learned a lot	4
really a great course i have learned a lot during this course it was well explained the teachers were dynamic and interesting i believe everyone should take the  weeks this course requires in order to become a better learner	3
very informational and useful	4
very good course and perfect instructor	4

i appreciate the efforts made by the team especially drchuck the way the content is delivered	4
great for people who would like to grasp the very concepts and basics of making a functional game	4
great course professor shapiros ability to digest philosophical arguments to then synthesize them in easier to comprehend terms is exceptional i am extremely please with the content and the course dynamics that invites to develop a critical thinking perspective	4
easy to follow the lectures which are systematic and structured besides learning grammar i found that the points about pronunciation were really useful which were not gone through in great detail when i attended korean classes in language schools due to time constraint hope that there will be future classes of higher levels from yonsei	3
this course is excellent one of the best course i did in my life tips like pomodoro deliberate practice gave me deep insights on to how we really learn and master subjects more importantly this course now gave me the confidence that i can learn anything with an attitude of learning even though i have no talentinterest towards it thanks for the instructors  for taking the time and putting it all together and giving it free via coursera	4
great course	4
the course was very good but i guess there were too many quizzes and the instructions  questions in the quizzes and other assignments are not unambiguous that could be improved other than that i liked the course and the specialization very much	3
i have learned a lot of things thank you	4
no matter you are new to your career or you are experienced for years this course will porvide you with insight and practice for observing yourself in your work and you will defenitly get learnings f	4
excellent learning	4
this was a very good course  one area that could be improved would be the discussion of industrial control systems ics on lecture briefly mentions stuxnet and scada but this was rather incomplete discussion a very recent incident that could have been used was the attack on the ukraine power grid as a demo of a cyber attack against infrastructure httpsicscertuscertgovalertsiralerth_mcsm_dr_editor_kellyjacksonhigginsi am perhaps biased toward this area since this is my field of work	3
this is a great course if anyone wanted to learn the art of applying macroeconomic principles in the real world scenarios then get enrolled to thid coursethanks coursera	4
lively and more practial	3
great introduction	4
very good and informative	4
this course gives very good insight into fundamentals of machine learning	4
totally love this course 	4
great course very eyeopening and an inspiring professor i will continue to explore more in that area after finishing	4
it was good and useful to get a better idea about the industry	3
the course content is highly challenging and thats great for a sense of accomplishment the biological problems motivates the biologist to go through the abstract mathematical conceptsbut i have to admit there is a threshold where the biologist can not get it well anymoregreedy motifs gibbs  and i wonder if he does really need it to be practical with day to day problems with chip array seq selexbe ready you will struggle hard here	3
i like the way the professor selects real world examples to explain code i am sure i would enjoy the course and learn a lot	4
informative course i learned a lot	4
many points are just a presentation of bulletins with a very brief description could use a little more depth or at least some pointers for further study	2
very unclear in the way it was presented and the subject that are being talked about and not very interesting partly because it was to easy for me	0
absolutely loved the course watched every lecture professor barry nalebuff is a great teacher his enthusiasm towards the subject matter is noteworthy didnt feel like a  hours course at all maybe because i played it on x the course helped me understand a great deal of theory on negotiation i compared the course content to my experience in negotiations and found the mistakes i was making ill try to correct those in future negotiationsid recommend the course to everyone	4
overall an excellent course that involved a lot of great material on the nonviolent efforts of the civil rights movement i thought i knew a lot about the civil rights movement but this course proved differently my only suggestion for improvement is to add a segment that focuses on the contributions of women although there was some discussion of womens contributions most of the material and all of the teachers professors speakers were male	4
it has been many years since ive had a physics course ive got a doctorate in another field ive been looking into biomechanical interfaces and felt that i needed to review some basic physics without all the hassle of a formal course and with the option of skipping around if i felt the material was too basic the lecture series allowed me to quickly and easily review some basic concepts without a formal structurei also have to say dr b did a terrific job of translating some potentially daunting concepts into enjoyable yet serious teaching metaphors a seriously fantastic job obviously as noted the gradient lecture series has some personal interest and i think that you might consider some introduction to matter	4
awesome course for an intro or to just refresh your skills	4
very useful and concice thanks	4
it is a rare online course of advanced pure mathematics overall it is very good it is not recommended to take other courses in parallel with this course as it will consume lots of time on external notes and references i would recommend national research university to open more similar courses on abstract algebra like groups rings fields and modules as a bridge program to this course or an extension of this course to lie algebra or representation theory	4
i got very good introduction not only for nlp but also for other adjacent topics like ml probability theory linear algebra highly recommend if you want to get involved in these topics	4
it was very interesting and very informative course and ive really enjoyed studying it i am very satisfied both with the presented information and manner of its presentation and looking for the continuation of study thanks to everyone who are responsible for this beautiful work	4
nice course its compact and straight to the point	4
interesting and clear for all levels of englishgood experience	3
this course was great the instructor really broke down the fundamentals of data analytics in several of modules the only thing i would have liked a little more explanation on is the sql section in module  i felt like this module went a little fast and could use some more supplemental information overall this was a great intro into the world of data analytics	3
the layout of this course is extremely well reasoned out each module gives important stepping stones for the students both to understand and to get practical skills to use the material after the course for me it was an extra bonus to learn about teh rails api in the th week of the course i will surely need that in the future all assignments include very thorough guidance on how you can check your own work one step at a time all the way through in fact i have never before attended a course where so much effort had been but into that part by the teachers much praise for that the graded assignments were hard i had to put in a quite considerable effort in each of them especially week  much more work than i had anticipated however i cannot point to any part of the material that could easily have been left out everything we learned seemed useful and important so in spite of the hard work i am happy that i stayed in there to the end	4
i could say  it is the best bayesian stat i ever experience till now	3
this course had a lot of depth to it both in the lectures and the programming assignments the last assignment seemed needlessly complex with not enough focus on the parallel programming aspect i wish there had been more of a focus on how to actually write the parallel and task constructs which were instead given already implemented without much explanation	3
great course i really enjoyed a lot of concepts and experiences will help me in my business thanks to ed the team and coursera	4
really outstanding course clear engaging and thoughtful prof zelikov knows how put complex subjects and historical situations in a most clear perspective without being superficial	4

great course for any student interested in how the internet come to be and the peopletechnology behind it	4
fantastic open a new gate for me	4
i enjoyed this course immensely i was a bit hesitant due to its length however the content was usually manageable and mostly interesting a couple of the weeks the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry also i think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation i feel as though i didnt really understand those concepts until watching that weeks as well as the next weeks lectures finally the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didnt match well to what the instructors actually said	3
its a wonderful course	4
a lot of calculation errors and incorrect answers	1
fantastic learning experience thanks	4
really motivating learning experience huge thanks to dr chuck	4
i really enjoyed the opportunity to better understand how best to learn though ive always said that i am a lifelong learner i dont think i ever fully knew how to be a lifelong learner until nowim excited to employ these strategies into my daytoday experiences	4
the course is to the point and very practical approach and easy to implement on websites	4
thank you for clarity and detailed explanation of basics	4
this course was a good introduction for me a nonengineer there was enough new material to make it worthwhile but not so much as to overwhelm me the instructor explained concepts in an accessible way using good examples drawn from daily life	4
this course is really very in depth and is a good mix of solid theory and real world application i think its a must for anyone in advertising sales or marketing	4

excellent course on machine learning thank you very much andrew ng	4
excellent material well thought out videos useful tips and interviews	4
great course	4
this was a decent class to get started on programming a raspberry pi and hooking it up to a web service the material was easy to follow and the instructions were precise with this class youll be in a position to create interesting applications using the raspberry pithere were two negatives to this class most of the assignments used the node red environment this is a visual programming tool although its easy to use i would have preferred programming using a more widely used and more powerful environment the auto grader for the class was not very robust and did a poor job of giving feedback on why things werent passing several times the assignment would pass in my environment but fail in the auto grader due to incorrect assumptions that the auto grader was making about implementationoverall this was a worthwhile course but could use some improvement	2
excellent overview of modern html a good start to the overall course	4
material for the course is outdated	0
this course change my life	4
the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe it was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers  a lack of understanding of how coursera works its clear they did not care to adapt to a  week course and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over  weeks to get done further to the course timeframe the assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions which is very strange in a course for coaching not the mention video quality that is scary i could not watch the videos and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions	0
there were some mistakes and weird glitches but overall solid overview of secondhalf chem	3
this course was a blast it dived a bit deeper into unity compared to introduction to game development the course outline and steps worked great and i learned a lot	4
the course was wellstructured and the instructor clearly illustrated statistical concepts to students who have no prior experience in the field although the lab assignment for each week may seem a bit stressful for beginners the overall learning is highly inspiring and does prove rewarding as students finally get to apply the technical skills to their final project also the guidance for each lab assignment was very helpful it would be even better if there are example code answers for the lab questions since some of the questions are a bit more complicated overall this is a worthtaking course	4
good one enjoyed	4
simple and clean very interesting also for who like myself has no children to grow up	4
its one of the first courses that i took in coursera it very helpfull to data analysis	4

great course this help me learn and somewhat increased my interest in robotics	4
great course great instructor definitely great knowledge thank you so much	3
this course was very informative relative to coming healthcare system changes that deal with it as well as the coming changes for transformation in payment models such as ffs to aco etc the other aspects of ethical concerns relative to public interest were very insightful as it outlines the challenges you face from enhanced productivity vs access to patient information in a public forum whereby the dat can be misused for gain or unnecessary wasteful tactics from those who do not possess the best veracity in the us healthcare system infrastructure as we move to valuebased care and potential increased capitation	4
prof randy picker is an engaging instructor material has sufficient rigor and is well presented at first i was worried as i dont have a legal background but i feel it is presented at an understandable if you spend any time on the internet you will learn incredible history from a legal and economics standpoint take this class	4

good introduction but not enough details	2
thank you for this amazing course	4
i was skeptical about the concept but once you get into the course it becomes addictive and certainly makes a lot of sense and positive impact on the way we lookconsider happiness	4
this is excellent training for the person who likes to keep up with the latest and greatest frontend developments if you dont like to switch up and turn on a dime then this course is not for you i had trouble aplenty and yet the point seemed to be stay flexible be prepared to use obscure tools that are supposed to make the site work better but who knows exactly what is happening under the hood expect change and adversity become an expert at debugging that crappy code and refactoring everything at the drop of a hat this is probably good approximation of real world experience where you would need to come in on a project and bail them out of angularjs damnation be prepared to be frustrated	3
super interesting coursewould be great to have more courses about forensic science	4
good introduction	4
very good course for freshers it was well planned and educational course please keep up the good work it is said that knowledge is power and i really mean it after completing the course	3
nothing i can say that made me jump for joy i fell asleep half the time	0

really complet course with a lot of knowledge easy to undestand and very visual which it help to focus on the information im so glad i took it no doubt to recomend to parents and people on the health area	4
the course has incredible content but you are required to read quite a bit of information via lengthy pdfs prior to the videos this is not my learning style so i found it challengingas a naturalist and bird lover i was eager to take the course and glad that i did	2
the course was really well presented taught and clear and although i would prefer it would have been taught in the newer version of python it actually helped me to do some research and learn new materiala warm special thanks to prof charles severance for his logical and laid back approachi hope that a follow up to some more advanced programming in python will take place in the futuremany thanks ricardo fernandes	4
one of the best courses ive ever taken would gladly attend more such courses	4

good course overview of computer architecture	4
underlying theory to machine learning helps a lot for work done in practice	4
thank you so much i have learn so much	4
good course for beginners who wants to learn property and liability i wish there could be more exercise between the videos to help us review what weve learned so we can understand betterthere could be also a discussion sectionlike a forumwhere people can discuss their misunderstanding otherwise this course is greati learned a lot	3
this is just an addendum to my previous review to make every bodies life easier i would suggest imposing a requirement that all homework be done using eclipse it is a popular ide for java programming and certainly adequate for this course then i would have the homework cast as an eclipse java project for each assignment in each raw assignment include something like thedropboxtest code that gives a testing framework personally i would do that with a junit style framework again it just makes life easier you could even bare bones testing assertions and have the students add their own stuff in which is what i eventually wound up doing the test themselves show how you expect the whole thing should workthen we students would import the homework as a new project do what needs to be done and just submit the code developed the point of including the testing framework is that ambiguities or interpretational variations can much reduced in what we are being asked to do i found that all my problems pretty much came down to thinking about how i would implement the functionality of the specification quite differently then how it needed to be done to fit into the grading framework there is really a lot of hidden specification in the grading framework i could not have done the assignments without the dropbox framework the grading process gave very little hints about what might have gone wrong which is ok for grading but not so useful for debugging the problem i think this kind of project approach would reduce a fair amount of the forum questions and at the same time make this course more accessible for java nubies	4
it was very good all the basics about python and the raspberry pi platform i would like if you publish a book to read about the topics for example i have been reading the book think python	4
excellent course thanks to prof colleen	4
great course to learn about brands and product management	4
very useful	4
good course the approach is wellbalanced no superficial and at the same time not too much professional the quiz are done very well	3
exceptional class very good analytical techniques i do recommend having an r background before taking this class but if you do its a treasure trove	4
very light  not really consistent with the heavy workload of subsequent courses felt it could have been much much stronger explaining github which shows up as a problem in latter courses strongly suggesting that toolbox does not effectively cover github for newbies	2
a very useful course	3
great content	4
takes you by the hand even if you have little or no background to the course elements in order for you to learn what may have otherwise been a fairly challenging topic certainly recommended	4
a good introduction but fairly simple for someone who already has some basis	3
great coursesgood	4
this is an excellent course for anyone who needs a better understanding of statistics and that includes all professions that deal with quantitative data it helps you become a better citizen by helping you decide when something is mere chance and when mere chance would not explain the events	4
overall very good learning from this course looking forward for more courses like this	4
it is interesting and helpful in developping good diets	4
short and appealing videos for each topic	4
great course for introduction actually the course itself does not tell detail enough for fully understanding of game theory extra studies are needed such as the reference book the article mentioned in the first week and also wikipediaorg but the lecture is good enough for us to know what we should search for	4
i love it thanks for the great work	4
a lively introduction to the basic theories of communication science with a very easytofollow approach i was getting into journalism at the time i took this course and it has helped me a lot in the acquisition of some fundamental knowledge	3
i always enjoy any course that maya does i love that she keeps it simple and provides us with videos of her cooking these simple but amazing meals	4
great course would do it again	3
the movie clips at the beginning made me wonder if the course was going to be worth it but once you get past that it gets very interesting	4
very basic course if you know about data science data analysis or machine learning you may find this class basic or boring good intro course for those who have no prior knowledge	2
very good ideas and tips for working better on an every day scheduleotimas ideias e dicas para trabalhar melhor no dia a dia	4
very good course thank you prof arne astrup this course is amazing	4
really nice course it extends our vision of what is possible to build as a data scientist strongly recommended	4
implementing even a few of the methods taught in this class helped me improve my learning and move forward knowing how to learn best is a key skill in todays world and professor oakland teaches this skill in a very clear and engaging way i really enjoyed this course	4
although i had some basic knowledge of data science before and also i did some programming in python yet i find this course comprehensive and practical	4
very informative  required for understanding the origins and fundamentals of machine learning	4
love this course give a basic understanding of guitar	4
lots of practice enjoyable	4
its easy to learn some basic theory from this course after that we may be able to develop some simple system about ml	4
this course is an excellent introduction to epidemiology i am prepared to pursue my interests in the subject	4
great course	4
great introduction to ml	4
this is definitely a mandatory beginner course if anyone is interested in pursuing journalism in the future	4

very creative	4
the course provides with usefull basic knowledge about healthy food the video in the courcse is interesting and motivating i think the course would be enteresting for all healthy consious people	4
very useful l learned a lot from this course	4
well explained in other courses finish continuare	4
courses like this are always difficult to judge because of the great variety of students coursera reaches that is some class members finished this course in the first week it was open others still struggled till the last minute for some the math was too simply for others the python programming was too confusing all in all it strikes a reasonable balance between novice learners and more advanced studentswhat the course could stand to really benefit from is some kind of repository of code for those students who successfully completed the assignments to compare to their own it seems pretty clear that there are some advanced python users whose insights could help improve ones coding skills	3
wonderful course can deliver a clear but vital idea about ml to you maybe the best fundamental ml course ever	4
this course must be taken to help learn tough materials in learning process	4
not too difficult and covering useful things like git and heroku	4
the class isnt over but im suffering through it not enjoying it like i did the dino uof a classes problems the presenter is horrible hes singsongy trying to be interesting cant you get the dino guy or me ill do it for free painful also  you need more graphics charging along with mr boring and a map of alaska behind him as concept after concept  difficult ones for folks who arent like me with lots of background  is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing yes i noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the sun at an angle around the sun graphic but who cares its something and yes i know its free and i know you have budgets but  universities cant rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship the content is probably better than my perception  and im perceiving high  because i need an aspirin after  minutes of mr please get a professional presenter or at least competent i create online education that is nothing better than powerpoint and a talking head lack of budget but at least the head doesnt make people want to drown themselves in a melting glacier	1
it was a perfect career development i liked the way of teaching i learned well and knew more about the career job process thanks it was very helpful to me	4

first weeks were overcomplicated with kmeans and stuff not related to spark itselfin general  great job  thx for such kind courses	4
very informative thoroughly enjoyed both the class and the teacher	4
i thoroughly enjoyed listen to professor severances lectures it made learning the first basics of python less daunting to someone with zero background in programming like me solving the course assignments gave me a sense of achievement even though i know real programming takes much much more than this i feel motivated to start the second course	4
good class challenging but fun	4
the site is not very user friendly the information is good though	2
good courseinspirational content	4
great informative course	4
very good	4
great course ever 	4
really a well thought out course and expertly delivered ive never had such well explained lectures using simple terms to explain complex subjects our professor is a master at education as well as her subject expertise this is a great course a little kooky at times but just the right amount of kooky to make it more interesting and fun thanks for the obvious hard work in producing the course and time expended making it	4
examples would help distinguish the nuances between the processes for example the use of the microsoft daily build great comprehensive course otherwise	3
i really loved the course and am extremely thankful for the opportunity	4
love itvery well organised and executed	4
the course seems to be useful but the tasks become hell you need either give more information and examples or decrease the complexity of the questions and tasks	1
provides information from basic laws of inheritance to understanding the field of evolutionary biology and genome sequencing explained in a light and easy to understand way not a course you can pass by knowing a few facts about the subjects tricky at times which help you find out if you understood everything correctly would recommend to others	4
the lecture videos are very interesting and informative	4
one of the best courses i am taking so far	4
a great course for anyone wanting to start on unityd in a light way there is no need of previous knowledge neither in unity or programming language just will to learn for anyone that dont know programming a good complement after this course would be a oriented object programming course	4
wonderful explanation and concepts were made easy to understand though a little more examples and application oriented lectures could be included	4
great course	3
after submitting the assignments and getting scoreit will be better if coursera provides the solution of those assignmentsby thisstudents will get benefit form this that what mistakes they did and how will it will be corrected in future	3
informative and fun	4
its really hard to communicate with coursera i have paid for the course havent enrolled due to my illness and there is nobody who can help me out with thisits a very nice project coursera but still has too much to make up what a pitymartin	0
great introduction loads of explanations and practical intuitions a must to start with 	4
very useful tools and tips lots of references in case you want to go deeper in any subject	4
fantastic course  doing the assignments forces you to really think about your game world	4
good course but the way it is required to be done sucks	1
even as a natural born english speaker i found this course helpful and educational	4
one of the best courses available online actually got to know how to apply theoretical knowledge in designing systems you people are the best and made concepts and things really easy hats off	4
great course thankss a lott	4

great introduction to functional programming and not just scala syntax 	4
a lot to learn from this course	4
this course dedicates an entire week to very simple topics the lectures could use some serious editing too to help you understand what i expect im taking this at the same time as im taking whartons week  entrepreneurship program ive also taken whartons intro to marketing course which i highly suggest over this course the quality is dramatically better getting started agile meets design thinking is a university of virginia course that also is a great example of how these courses should be done im hoping the next courses in the digital marketing capstone are much better so that im not watching a lecture and counting how many times the professor pushes his glasses back upon the plus side i did like the engagement this course encourages by forcing you to go to other websites  accomplish things as well as review your peers work i wish your peer reviews had less of an outcome on your grade though in my experience many people did not even read the instructions on how to review the assignments	1
really helpful full of things that could seem obviously after the course but not before thanks	4

this course was really good from the information available and the follow along for the course the biggest issues i had were that unity had issues between the different releases for the various platforms the import of the assets on windows  required some extra lifting that was not covered by the videos and the teachers were not very present on the message board which seems to be an everpresent problem in this specialization	3

great content	4
very useful course for newcomers to machine learningthe basic ideas are plain and clear and its cover major aspectshowever the value of the course would be much higher if the real practical examples are used in roll forward manner for instance throughout the course we are considering housing pricing from the plain gradient descent algorithm to much more complicated issuesso far topics are too theoretical an sometimes it is hard to apply to the practicemoreover it is nice to add the course with notes in pdf format because to listen or watch video lectures is not convenient at least it would be nice to have the set of outer links to read each topic in details	2

i love the main lecture of the statistics the subject is fun after couple lecture my mind was very clearbut most of the time im working on the statistics software name r i think it would be better if require r knowledge if not student like me will need more than weeks to get use to r i dont mean learn another software is bad idea i will always like to learn something new thats why i go mooc what i mean is r and basic statistics should be separated first r than basic statistic or first basic statistic than ri really enjoy the class but the extra is a bit heavy for me	0

the course gives a very high level overview of hardware security and does not go into particular details understandably hardware labs are not included in this online course and the only practice is basic boolean and modular algebraquality of the media and transcripts can be improved sound is very low and noisy in some videos which makes it hard to watch on a mobile device some videos seems to be cut of too early and weeks  videos are out of order which is annoyingoverall its an okay overview of the topic for someone who is unlikely to apply it at daily job eg software engineer like myself	2
great course very useful information and tool	4
very good course but i think this specialization focus on mathematical analysis we need to practice more	4

the content is very useful for beginners moreover the material is very good nevertheless the links target in pdfs cannot be reached	3
some interesting points of view and case studies but the material itself is not in a structured format that means you could lose your way half way through the video too one dimensional in terms of presentation and no opportunity to interact with tutors to summarize i think it is a waste of opportunity to not use the videointeractivitycollaboration platform to its fullest potential	1
i have problems with focusing and specially focusing in lectures where the professors are too technical with their vocabulary however with professor chucks way of teaching i dont have this difficulty he is able to teach in a way that is simple and posible to understand i wish every professor can join this teaching style for the sake of learning complex concepts in an easy way since the professor is really good the course is great	4

this is a great introductory coursethe course materials are carefully organized to avoid lengthy mathematical content yet conveying the key idea of machine learning the selection of the topic also seems quite reasonablethis course builds a somewhat solid ground for beginners after finishing this course one can either try to move towards the more theoretical side maybe by reading the books such as learning from data by yaser abumostafa or the lecture notesvideo of the standford course cs or the more applied and practical side depending on the preference	4

this course is a good start if you already have a little experience with css as a neophyte i found that there was too much material for the amount of presentation time i needed many more examples and exercises i felt dejected each time the instructor said not to worry about getting it right and just experiment  thats easy to say if you arent being graded the fact is that the material is extensive and often complicated and its imperative for me as a student to be correct as fast as possible the result is that my grade a does not reflect my comprehension of the material i managed to commit the material presented to short term memory so that i could pass the course but as always happens when someone crams the information is gone from my head	2

very good updated information and analysis	4
week  was particularly tough to get through instructor seem uninterested and the constant hair flipping was distracting videos came through blurry despite using high quality settings there was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized on a few occasions i had to backtrack through the videos to find something i missed and in one area instructor had to go back and fix something but didnt bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself in the end i gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research	1

i really liked the practical orientation of the class  despite being rather short you get to learn about real world applicationsprofessor ng did an amazing job on his programming assignments as well  the problems are encapsulated in a framework that effectively hides the low level  checking routines to let us code the logic if you want to push it further the whole code is available tooan obvious recommendation 	4

overall good course with a lot of examples though some important steps seems to be missing so could not follow along with all the demos had to spend some unpredictable amount of time digging into some questions probably it is fine but the difference between  previous courses and this one in the program is vivid i had a problem installing doorkeepermongodb and it does not seem that this problem for a number of users good that it was not in the final project	2
great i find it very useful	4
without question the content is great but the written assignment instructions were somewhat vague and did not match the peer review rubric at times although the mentor did pin a few posts to address the problem	3
professor zweig is a real expert on the topic	4

it was amazing thousands thanks to drchuck fellow classmates  of course all these great people in the bonus videosi have started my programming adventure with drchuck and now there is a burning desire to keep going it is highly recommended to get this courseall the bestsinan	4
the content of the course is ok the main problem is that the way the information is presented ilkay altintas who is the main lecturer is a sweet woman but lecturing from a manuscript is not her strongest side it is clear that she is reading from a screen while she is looking into the camera anyone could do that job and they should have chosen more of an news anchor type of person with better pronunciation and more flow its simply very uninspiring and boring to listen to also  dollars is far too expensive for such a short course	1
i recommend this course to all my colleagues its enriched content certainly helped me to understand things in better way and provided content in structured way which is i liked most	4
an excellent course  as an introduction it covers the material in a logical way and presents critical views on actions of parties on all sides has whetted my appetite to know more about the history of creation of israel and to explore particular avenues that couldnt be covered in detail due to introductory nature of course	3
this course has provided a great deal of hands on case studies to increase my understanding of interface design i highly recommend this course for those interested in learning about designing for various devices and screen sizes	4

great course	4
this is a course that teaches good intentions and careful planning can change the world starting with you the university of virginia offers valuable knowledge in this course and anyone with an interest in business would benefit from the philosophical arguments presented in this course about ways of thinking about individuals communities and societies to make a positive difference in the world utilizing philanthropy and social responsibility as two concepts of many to improve financial and cultural wellbeing	4
i am not impressed with this course so far the quizzes and assignments are out of order with the materials being presented  the questions on each come from readings and lecture content that have not been introduced to the audience at that particular point in the course the first module was a very very basic outline of a generic analysis process and really has nothing to do with digital marketing analytics in particular	1
really i loved this course	4
after completing this course youll learn a lot of useful techniques and ideas which allow you to learn much faster and better moreover some techniques are very helpful in your daily life and could have significant impact on your life	4

good but gives the very basics	3
ive learned lots of new things	4
fourth week of the course was too much to handle and imbibecould not practice and complete within stipulated time	3
a solid course to kick off the specialization but not worth taking on its own	3
nice course every concept was explained in necessary details the quizzes should include questions which should be inferential rather than only output based	3
very nice and insightful we learned with the past how to face the problems of the present what was their means of control to exterminate the different	4
this was a great course and gave me a very good starting point for html css and js the only negative i found was that the js module seemed a bit rushed and the assignments at the end of last two modules didnt really test my understanding of js concepts very well they were too simple because the starter code had a lot of things already written out making them more barebones and having the student fill out most of the details would be a more handson and useful activity in my opinion	3
the course provided a bunch of meaningful insights many techniques to approach project management were presented i feel much more prepared to handle a project now excellent content	4
very interesting and exciting to learn more strategies	4
well prepared materials that provide simple basic understanding of philosophy great effort from the team big thanks	4

the course is clear informative and yet not very hard jim fowler is crazy looking but hes very engaging you want to share his craziness about calculus and by the end of the course i found myself enjoying when new approaches come from previously learnedthe only one slight minus for me was that there is no medium complexity homeworks tests and exercises are sometimes too easy and repetitive on the other side challenges given in lectures are too hard and has no answers to check yourself 	4
extremely useful information thank you	4
comes in very handy when you want to improve you english fast	3
ill give two stars cause lectures are way to boring to follow	1
this course should be called intro to fundamentals of website design you may learn in the process of a few days how to create a website but not how to create a website in a weekend	0
 awesome as usual	4
excellent class  interactive with interesting videos and exercises	4
really good practice tips	4
great course	4
this course feels like a bad news anchorman reading the teleprompter it gives a lot of formulae without proper explanations a lot of quiz answers do not come from the video lectures the course is really just spitting formulae from the dissertation trajectory generation and control for quadrotors by daniel warren mellinger easily found using search engines reading the dissertation before doing the course would probably help understand the formulae they say out of context without the proper explanations sorry for the bad review its the first time i leave one like that although ive completed many moocs i hope it will help to improve the course	1
very nice content easy to understand with assessments that are challenging but do not take much time	4
its a awesome course	4
very interesting course broad spectrum of basic terms introduced good opportunity to grasp a feeling of real problems concerning machine learning and to solve selected problems on your own	4

good course i learn many things about the human bias on decision making from neuroscience and evolution point of view especially the relation of prospect theory and the neuroscience and its related br	4
a good introduction to programming in general and in relation to web apps a lot of focus on just a few problems mainly graphics manipulation but a good starting point i think looking forward to learning much more in future courses	3

a lot of content covering range of topics  very clearly presented and well prepared training assingments	4

exceptional content that approaches important aspects of leadership	4
loved this course very interesting and fun to experiement with the different aspects of design	4
great course andrew ng does a good job at easing you into this complex subject particularly for somebody like myself without much maths background looking at other video courses on the subject i think more interactive visualisations couldve been a great help for example to gain some intuition about polynomials with different input parameters drawing lines on screen works but ive had many revelations when working with the interactive tools linked from the wiki content in some course exercises the tutor and lecturer disagreed on the approach eg vectorised vs iterative so the videospdfs were inconsistent with discussionstutorials  a bit confusing	3
great and organized material in a very step by step building of skills great class	4
it was a little short but packed with good and practical info	3
great course  even for someone who is a novice in the subject the professor presents the fundamentals in a clear simple and concise manner i had thought before doing the course that it would involve plenty of mathematical formulae and statistics but such was not the case elementary mathematical knowledge of high school level would suffice anyone who needs to know basics of how a welfare state should or should not operate ought to do this course	4
easy to understand and course materials is really useful	4
by far one of the best courses ive taken at coursera it opened my eyes to the phenomena around us and what the corelation between all the factors in our lives amounts to the changes weve induced to the planet it has made me rethink my own life my work and the urgency i have as volunteer member of a disaster risk reduction to multiply this information to as much persons as i can dr sachs explains every detail and definition with such simplicity that it makes it possible for anybody to understand the severity of the challenges were faced at this moment in time	4
enjoyed refreshing through this coursevery useful case studies	4
very relevant if you want to understand the theories behind data systems and algorithms i consider it a bit time consuming but completely worth taking into consideration the amount of topics it covers	4
one of the awesome course on classification just so perfect for learning	4

incredible class	4
very instructive and a good start up i love the way the lectures are prtesented helps you get the grab of the materials	3
this is a real free and excellent course for anyone who wants to learn all the fundamentals of python data structures thank you dr chuck	4
i liked the course as with the previous three courses dr severance does a great job presenting the material and explaining how the code works i felt that the assignments and the book were lacking a little bit the textbook needs to be updated to include the object oriented programming section that is covered in week  there is no programming exercise for the oop section just a quiz there are no assignments in the textbook for chapters  and  the examples of the code and how it works is awesome though which is a trade off of sorts the chapter  programming assignments only require minimal programming in python andor sql i would have liked to do a little more programming chapter  felt like it was shoved in at the end and the assignment was really easy i was hoping for a little more rigor on that one alsooverall it was a good experience and im looking forward to finishing up this specialization when the capstone is unlocked and becomes available	3
i do like the course but coursera has disabled discussion forums for this course which makes it impossible for the students to interact and find answers to problems or discuss possible errors in the example code student interaction is one of the strongest aspect of moocs without it this might as well be nothing more than a series of youtube videoshad coursera not discontinued the discussion forums id have given this course four or five stars	1
no much staff in it	1
along this course i discovered the importance of the introspection how can you discover your strengths to improve them and your weaknesses to work on them	4
what a wonderful and useful course	4
really interesting and well presented videos the quizzes were also well thought out with relevant questions without being too difficult	4
really liked the course and the teachers would have preferred more detail on the quizzes so i didnt feel as lost as i did some of the times while trying to piece together what a question meant	4
this course strayed too far from its origins yes this course contains topics that are nicetoknow but they are by no means essential or useful	1
i really got a lot of the course the material is explained very well the programming assignments helped further the understanding the recap video that summarizes the entire module in  min is also very good	4
this is the best course i have come across in coursera the way andrew ng teaches this course made me complete  weeks of course in two days kudos to you guys	4
simple and fasttry to put more difficulty on the quizzes	2
realy good one	4
nice course but it needs harder assignments	3
like the concise format of the course it helps me to look the project from different prospective and i tried to use it practically to plan my project during this course i recommend this course to anyone who wants fair amount of knowledge in very limited time	4
its a compulsory course to apply for professional accountancy msc of uol short smart course	4
i love this	4
this was a very helpful course to prepare a resume	4
a lot of great information this course made my teaching of world history so much better	4
nice work love it thanks for the great support	4
the course is very short and more advanced courses are not free	0
i enjoyed the course but i the scripting part was still mainly heres a script to add to the game and then well look it over there was very little scripting until the project which really didnt require much scripting eitheri recommend adding more actual scripting or a new section or course that discusses actual scriptingotherwise i did find it informative i have a lot more questions but until i see the final course i cant say whether theyll be addressed	3
good content	4
i found most of what was presented very interestng i found that when the lesson on chicken soup and stew was being presented that you used chicken broth from a box to get better flavour of your chicken soup why not just add one cube of beef better yet with your stew why not add some homemade veggie stock which can keep in the freezeroverall i enjoyed the course but if you could address the above issue of chicken broth from a box i would appreciate it also is there a way to get your drawings from this lesson thank you	3
nice and challenging thanks so farthe assignments are somewhat hard but not too hard forced me to sit down and thinkthats very good	4
tortured by a platform glitch that initially denied me credit for my work and the certificate of completion but would not tell me specifically why turns out i needed to submit one additional peer review although i only found this out by contact customer service there was never any explicit message telling me what was required to complete the course and the information i did receive through the platform was just plain wrong content of the course was good but any feelings of accomplishment were overshadowed by the frustration of trying to straighten out what turned out to be a problem with coursera	0
excellent video series with very good teaching staff	4
brilliant	4
very good course	3
excellent course in my opinion the learning materials of the last week can be divided in two weeks	4
thoroughly enjoyable and dr chuck has a great teaching style	4
a course that really makes you feel good	4
poor very poor course worse course structure instructor hasnt put any thoughts in how they should strucutre this coursecover no basics assumes lots of thing and term this course as beginner for java where actually there is no java taught	0
great stuff learnt 	3
i like this course too much	4
this course has been deeply informative the instructor is outstanding sharing his deep experience and knowledge of economics geography international development and earth science through the lectures the time commitment required for this course is minimal considering the immense treasure of learning it represents my only issues with this course hence  stars instead of  are  no one is monitoring the course so questionscomments are only answered by other students and  there is no certificate thank you coursera and dr sachs for this fantastic course	3
the best course ive taken on coursera so far this was the first ever course offered on coursera by the founder himself andrew ng hes a great instructor covering topics right from the ground to the sky id say the implementation is in octave instead of popular languages like rpython which could have improved upon a lot for learners but since andrew has focussed this course upon beginners i think octave is aptthe assignments were relatively easy as most of the implementation ground work was done only the main functions were to be implemented but yes i learnt a lot from the way the assignments are designed you create a digit recogniser just by being through this coursei would recommend it to all learners who are beginning with machine learning or data sciences to take up this course	4
it is good and very important course	4
well structured course the explanation was clear and i have the frame works in my mind when i finish the course helpful course	4
its an excellent course very useful and the most important is that its easy to learn	4
great and easy to learn	4

till now  the videos are wonderful  they are well  designed	4
at this moment this course has been really good	4
this is useful course provided me fundamental understanding of javascript and css	4
it is very suitable for those who have no background involving machine learning this lecture is very basic but practical and essential	3
some missed explanations in the first week mergedsort implementationtha last two videos are quite difficult to understand the concbuffer structure seems to be poweful but the explanation and examples are tightin this course the weekly tasks are explained very well thank you very much	3

the course provides with a detailed overview on how the eu is functioning if you intend to study the eu law this course is very helpful to understand the basics	4
super great teacher very interesting new things to learnhighly recommended for people who love math	4
very simple intro to techniques that exist in machine learning the content of each week could be improved by extending to include proofsderivations and making calculus a prereq but this does make the course very accessible which is a big advantage	4
excellent course with a lot of examples and explanations id recommended this course to all new students	4
easy	4
it was ammazing	4
this course is nice but very lengthy videos and at one points i didnt understand some topics  quiz are pretty tough to solve 	2

good course and instructor	3
i personally enjoyed the course however i was disappointed when i was told after week  or  that id completed the course when i in fact hadnt gotten to the end and had not done the final two assignments regardless i went ahead and finished the course but i was also disturbed to see that some of the students did their assignments in a mockery fashion eg wrote song lyrics or stated i dont know what else to say so i will tell you about my day that was very irritating the class wasnt described clearly in the catalog i thought it would be more of a history of the periods plus literature but it wasnt exactly that instead it was a discussion of techniques and prose and exhibiting truly talented authors i liked the class just not what i expected	3
assessments are way harder than the taught content be aware to spend way more time on them than the estimates	2
great course which give many useful information	4
prof northcraft goes straight to the point very clear concepts and ready to use	3
awesome course  i wish i had taken this course before i finish my bachelor degree	4
solid entertaining intro to programming and python dr chuck does a good job of not overwhelming in the first course while giving enough info to get us started on the road to programming	4
refreshing your basicsthe whole course is a just brushing up your basic math the videos are brief and to the point and problems make you use your brains and they are not right out of the video or any other reading material i feel only bayes and binomial theorem videos are not comprehensive and the problems a quite challenging	3
gentle intro to frp	4
it is an interesting and easy to understand overfiew of the topic i recommend it for newbies to the topic and those who just want to refresh basic knowledge they might have gathered in other courses	4
thank you very much for the very enjoyable and very educational experience i love it	4
great program well structured with lots of additional resources that make for easier selfstudy videos are just the right length to provide the knowledge without being too long and too filled with details all in all this is an excellent nd course in my ruby on rails web development skills development	4

i really enjoyed the lectures the introduction to tableau was broad enough to get a feel for possibilities and gave plenty of resources to further look for guidance as needed in addition the focus was not just on the technical tool but relaying the differences in visualization for analysis and visualization for persuasion i enjoyed her lecturing and felt like the visual science and very specific actionable takeaways were good	4

the course provides complete information and guidance for a beginner in web designing me being unfamiliar with programming before starting here our mentors and teachers provided study material in such a manner helped me a fresh comer learn html css and js quickly and pretty well in a month you really do learn a lot you require a good amount of selfdiscipline and dedication for learning any new subject specially if youre juggling it with a job or being a university student but the quality of lecture videos the material provided for extra learning and the weekly amount of work is perfect for coaching you in web designinggood luck 	4

really enjoyed this course highly recommended for non native speakers who wants to speak like a native	4
i would have given just one star except the swirl assignments are actually very good the videos are just a poorly narrated glossary topics i learned in another course were presented here in such i way i actually got confused can you imagine my knowledge was actually worsened not improved by thus course   if the swirl functions were made the centerpiece of the course and the videos were described as just a narrated glossary at least our expectations would be in line with reality  even so i come to coursera because i want to be taught by an instructor if id wanted a curated list of tutorials so i could teach myself i would have done that already anyone who pays for this should get their money back not recommended for beginners  i going to complete it because im stubborn that way but it is an unpleasant experience for me and everyone within earshot as i have to vent my frustration often just to make it through  after week  i resorted to just reading the pdf of the slides and stopped watching the videos the videos added nothing to my understanding more often than not they put me to sleep and whats worse the narrator mispronounces attribute there is a difference i attribute certain attributes to native speakers who mispronounce important vocabulary	1
clear and practicalexcellent mix of theory and examples	4
the course in very interesting it is focused on cyber threats cyber crime actors of cyber crime motivation attributions psychology international situation cyber attacks in history confidence building measuresi learnt a lot from the course and i highly recommend the course to others	4
warning the lecture videos along will not be enough to prepare you for the final assignment be prepared to do your own research for the extra study materials on the forum many students said they had to drop out during the last week probably without getting a refund because they were completely caught off guard by the huge knowledge gap between lectures and the final assignment if you are determined to get the specialization certificate you should definitely start the final assignment as early as possible dont wait until the last week or two	0

excellent course that lives up to its reputation as a great introduction to machine learning youll learn a lot of the relevant concepts via lectures and apply them through the quizzes and programming exercises basic programming knowledge would be helpful but no deep statistical  computer science  linear algebra background is required to fully enjoy the course ive taken formal machine learning  artificial intelligence classes as a cs undergrad and still found this course to be very useful in both refreshing and learning concepts thank you dr ng	4

great course and great teacher	4
it was great to listen to someone with as much experience as ira pohl i learnt a lot in this course but it required a lot of work on my part it might still be better than trying to learn totally on your own but i would have liked a bit more structure and assistancethe slides showed on videos not available for download in the session i took could be formatted better the concepts were presented too superficially in my view and the structure was a bit disorganized the assignments where difficult in part because they werent stated very clearly but they were very interesting and were a great way to learn or review computer science courses while learning to code in cdespite these shortcomings im glad i took the course and im overall happy with it	3
incredibly well structured course it covers very interesting topics which are essential for a career in fashion and luxury the interactive lessons are very effective and there are great guest speakers the only downside is that certain stats should be updated with more recent figures overall great course	3
it was a little long before getting to the really interesting stuff but its a good course for what you pay i wish there were a follow up one like a level i also wish that brian didnt refer to groups of dogs as dog packs as dogs are not pack animals this leads to confusion as dog owners will then believe that they need to be a pack leader and everything that comes with that stereotype i also wish he didnt focus so much on the idea that dogs are from wolves because again many people revert to this is how wolves are so this is how i treat my dog it leads to confusion just read the comments on some threads even while doing this course people were saying how they need to be a pack leader and how they follow what cesar milan doeshowever for those of us that know there is a difference it was interesting to learn more about the differences between wolves and dogs i just wish the course focused more on dogs	2
great course for beginner	4
very clear and approachable even for people without a law background like me i will miss it	4

honestly this course was a waste of time the professor seems to have gathered some information about the version history of ios and android platforms thrown it onto some slides and then reads from those slides there is no discussion of the context of those technologies	0
a must for all project managers	4
ive been to college so im not the target audience for this course but i was curious to see what would be covered and to learn more about colleges today i felt the course covered mostly simplistic obvious stuff and left out a lot that many students wonder aboutone topic that was covered was the different activities of professors i wished id known more about this when i started college of course i knew they did research but i thought they were primarily there to teach this is true at some colleges but at others the amount and quality of research can determine whether a professor gets to continue working there and reach tenure so teaching may not be the first priority for some professors students may find that chunks of courses are devoted to a professors research interests which could enrich or derail the course this could have been covered in more depthother things that could have been covered why some courses are so large and the function of recitation sections and graduate teaching fellows for those and smaller courses what a seminar is the existence of course reviews that can help with selecting classes and professors how to deal with not getting into a course you really need to take wait lists professorial overrides etc when prerequisite courses are really necessary and when theyre just recommended dropping courses grades how the college grading system works what happens when you fail a course academic probation earning honors campus codes of conduct greater freedom as with class attendance smoking and drinking rules harassment policies and disciplinary actions disciplinary probation expulsion good campus activities for shy students	2
its good	4
great course with a lot of insights	4
great course to understand the basic knowledge of internet technology	4
great introduction to html colleen really explains stepbystep how to code and what to look out for along the way huge thanks for this	4
i found the course very helpful in terms of vocabulary and grammar and i will continue practicing with it there are a few errors here and there that need to be corrected in the quizzes and such the main issue is that while it is billed as a vocabulary course and starts with simple concepts it is more of an intermediate than a beginner course for someone who has never studied a foreign language before it is more like a course for padding out your vocabulary and practicing grammatical constructions than a language learning course	3
good introduction to user interface design	4
excellent great teacher too thank you	4
love this course the way she teaches and the fact i can do it at my own pace however i seem to rush though this as i understand it all and love it cannot get enough	4
ill definitely keep learning the next coursesome people criticized about graphlab i thought they should offer  versions like rstudio instead a limitfree one although i feel comfortable when using graphlab ill still use scikitlearn after finishing all courses because it is free and i just use for personally but you can use scikitlearn to pass this course although you have to spend more time  so this is not a sufficient reason to not giving  stars for megreat course	4

the only problem was the lack of portugueseenglish subtitles	3
this course is quite tough and i often thought to myself if this is an intermediate level what does a professional level look like especially the later assignments are quite difficult and time consuming to solve it says you need approximately three hours to solve the last one well it took me about  hours to come up with a halfdecent attempthowever if you really want to learn something new about cool flying robots and who doesnt and are willing to spend quite an amount of effort and time this is the course for you	3

cool	4
very beneficial and easy to understand thanks a lot dr chuck and coursera	4
thank you for the interesting courseone thing that this course lacks in my opinion is the division of the lecture material in smaller parts it is easier to proceed when the videos are about  minutes long than  you can always stop in between those parts without the need to remember the last minute of the video you watched and also to feel closure since the part has been checked as completedthanks again i wish your course improves and stays successful	3

interesting to acquire basics of tableauthen a lot of fundamental features are missing like interaction level of details and so on	3
very thorough and consistent teaching david is just great	4
all the lectures are not clearly explained and a fresh person cannot understand few things and even in the assignments not mentioned properly what has to be done and if not how to solve them and how can you imagine the learner knows all the terms related to web or the particular language you need to explain the new terms which you use in the lectures and the lectures should be elaborate and should stress more on the basic things like abcdefg here you need to explain a in detail b in detail c in detail so on then after in the next lectures you can move fastlynot satisfied	1
this class needs more content more explanation it is clearly a very important aspect of data science but the assignments were more complex than the given course content	1
although all coursera courses are same the peer assessment is very useful for this course its very helpful to see products made by other people	3

excellent course learning is not done by rote but rather by understanding the material	4
i should have started with the course learning how to learn first before i even started with this introductory human physiology course because it would have better prepared me to understand the course better and be able to finish the course on time it looks like i will need to really study this course slowly at my own phase by not being concerned and bothered by any deadline thanks and congratulation to the professors responsible for putting up together complex course on line and free at that	4

as a java programmer with some  years industry experience i quickly got lost on this course it might not be the course  it could be me it might be that i am too long in the tooth as an oo programmer that i cannot cope with the transition to functional programmingi found the video lectures initially well structured and stepped nicely in to increasing complexity without losing me but eventually i fell completely behind and by the time i was performing the exercise  submission i was in deep water there are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which i did not likeas a real world programmer i have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory and i struggle to understand how performing this exercise prepares me for realworld scala programming either i just do not see the point of creating code that can add and subtract numbers without using number types i could write a wrapper for int in java in  minutes doing this abstract scala exercise would take me all day and i still do not understand the code nor the point of doing it whatever happened to maintainability principles i have now lost all interest in completing the course because by week  i might as well be doing a course in advanced arabic i cannot continue this course now because i cannot complete the exercises i am disheartened and not sure whether this is a reflection of scala or the course or both i would be reticent to take a job with scala	0

thanks for this clear and useful course	4
only  minutes of video average per week really nice pleasant video but dont expect to learn how to solve the problems because there is little connection from the problems to the videosteaching assistants are hard working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do thingsvery little in the way of effective educational designbut they do create useful questions to answer if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instructionthe estimate of time required is woefully inadequatethe best thing you can do is lookup brandon rhodes on youtube he will actually explain pandas expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions use the course forum extensively  only there will you get a hint of how to do what they askgoogle and stack overflow thats their extensive list of references	2
good course	4
its well done i was expecting more details in the lessons while students its requested to search many things on internet in order to learn for instance gitbash however its a good first course	3
