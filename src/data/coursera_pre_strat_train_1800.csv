eda approach and steps to analyse is excellently taught the formal modelling take the course to a lot of depth	3
i am taking the digital marketing specialization and this has been the poorest course i have taken thus far the instructor is obviously reading directly from a script because of her constant long pauses between words and how frequently she gets lost when presenting information she also clicks to new slides and bullet points at the wrong time which is very disruptive the information presented on the slides really does not summarize what she is saying at all and i constantly had to refer to the transcript to get the information i needed to write downthe assesment questions for this course are also quite poor and a lot of the time need to be further researched online the quiz questions also seem more involved than the lectures presented and can need some researching as well i was looking forward to this course and i am disappointed the instruction for this course seems like she does not the subject well enough to provide insight and quite possibly as if this is the first time she is giving a lecturepresentation	1
i wish this course was more focused on building and analyzing data in excel it feels like its more focused on financial measurements and probability it hasnt related to my line of work yet	2
good for someone just start learning python	3
nothing practical	0
good quick start for beginners in project management can be suggested for capm preparation	4
awesome content i leaned a lot	4
could have been presented in a better way	1
provided nothing of value or relevance to the previous courses additionally there was essentially no input from wharton instructors	0
this course helped me a lot its a big help to me as a student to learn all of this in videos and words	4
this course is pretty basic as far as grammar goes it really only covers tenses and parallel agreement im also pretty there is more to punctuation than the semicolon and the comma although i didnt realize how complicated comma placement could bethe professor talks like shes on tranquilizers and its difficult to do peer reviews when  of the class apparently doesnt speak english as their first languagei learned some things but this course should really be called how and when to use a comma would anyone really pay money for this	1
interesting subject but not much content and assessments are way too short more variety in assignments would be nice too	1
thanks courseranice course and i have learned lot of stuff in this website	4
it is a very small introduction to swift while the last assignment expects you to be rather fluent in programming using swift a lot of self study using the guides provided by apple and other sources is needed to successfully complete this coursefurthermore the videos indicate a lack of preparedness on part of the instructors as a lot of sentences are cut of halfway  then started a new with a new goal all of which makes this course very hard to understand for free it is passable but had i payed i would sincerely regret itpart  is better but still changing thoughts midway in a sentence	0
this course should be longer and more in depth however i did find the readings quite useful and intriguing	2
its a shame to split a one month course to four	0
expected so much more	1
what a great course the content was prescient to the artwork i do and the assignments fun and applicable i look forward to taking the next course in the sequence	4
the content of this course was pitched well for a beginner in social media and marketing and provided a great overview of what to expect from the rest of the specialisation the resources were varied and interesting and came in a variety of formats to be accessible to as many students as possible the quizzes were wellsetup some of the wording of the assignment was difficult to understand and this from a native english speaker and the range of answers i reviewed for my peers reflected that this was not just the case for me it was fascinating reading what others were using social media and digital marketing strategies to leverage  the variety of industries and subsectors represented in the cohort was amazing	3
this was a well presented course that covered some very interesting areas of planet earth becoming sustainable it was detailed and demanding but fair and we learned a lot	4
it was a excellent experience i learn so many things about food and beverage management and i feel ready to start managing companies of this subject lessons were useful for me to add marketing and management knowledge	4
excellent course by salvatore scibona the range of subjects covered was so wide and the practical tips given in the course are really helpful thanks a lot salvatore a welldesigned course 	4
this course so far is really very useful in my academics and through this course i am now wellversed with all the marketing strategies used in the industryi would like to thank the professor for teaching us so well	3
for an introductory course with no prerequisites the assignments should cover material that has been introduced in lectures nonintroductory and advanced courses in r can require students to look outside of lectures for completing relatively complex problems	0
very hard for a beginner lacks the slow build up i needed missing an explanation about a comma cost me about  hours the assignments are brutal which encourages cheating	0
very good overview over a topical area  more indepth exercises for testing ones own understanding might have been helpful	3
i am disappointed about this course i was expecting to learn more in this subject as described on the course info however the quality of the lectures is not good at all i havent found any lecture that present the knowledge as the ivy league university as yale i felt sorry for the students who actually attained this class at yale campus the professor was not prepare for the lectures and confusedforgot sometime i was hoping that the nobel prize winner would teach something that complicated in the simple way the questions in the exam ask mostly about year person numbers which is not the good exam per my perspective if you want the have the certificate from yale you can take this course but if you want to learn about financial markets i would not recommend this course im so sorry	0
the quizzes are not set up correctly and you get marked wrong when you put in the correct answers it seems that the course was rushed and not properly tested before it accepted students the content is good and that is why i gave it more than one star	1
a bit too much math in the questions although it seemed in the videos that we could skip it im very visually oriented and also a mensa member and i would have explained more with graphics or at least not have to much equations in the questions	3
best course i have done so far i find the course interesting stimulating and most importantly enjoyable and informative thank you professor and ie business school 	4
i expected far more handy real life excel examples not to see a teacher speaking and writing stat formulas for hoursthe idea of this course is very good it has some room for improvement	1
i liked the emphasis on the spoken language and the bullets on china and its culture i wish we had also the chinese characters as in the first course there were problems with the computer assessment of some of the quizzes	2
this course is a joke contents is very very poor and you will have a lot of problems making the assigments	0
i found this course to be stimulating and challenging the coursework is much more difficult than the prerequisites would have you believe i found myself dusting off my old linear algebra texts and matrix math notes in the end i worked through it but it was a struggle	3
very good course i think i am addicted to programming	4
really i havent seen a course with slides till nowno one will be interested to take a course like this with some slides to read from	0
some lessons are too simple the homework is not very clear and you need much more time to do it than it is said	1
the proposition of the course is very interesting the content especially from the required book is very good but i think the instructor could dive deeper in the content of her lectures and they could be a little bit more dynamics	2
i think it is a decent course to understand how the peer review process work however it does not really help to write a paper i think some ideas are not applied to every field in particular telling students to look for the board of editors in a journal and adapt your results and how you express things accordingly it is in my opinion a bit unethical moreover i was expecting that the course will be taught by a professor but instead it is done by a group of phds some of them in their first year of research if they intend to target a phd audience this is clearly a drawback as some of them might know the same as you do finally as some people already pointed out the quality of the english of some of the instructor is not good in particular there are a couple of them that you cant barely understand it would have been more useful if the full course is taught by the  of them that can actually speak good	1
i dont like the tools they used it seems like a promotion for their company	0
video is of poor quality instructor distracts you picking up his glasses from his nose every  seconds reading outdated you can suggests books from  on digital topics and last assignment is based on a website that is not longer online	1
basic but interesting	2
thank you for this course i learned so much on this course it has encouraged to not give up on this new career of web development i have started	4
good overview needs to include more hands on development  star because coursera wont let me take the capstone even after completing all four prerequisite classes this one is the fourth	0
if you are considering this specialization i would recommend the andrew ng course instead and the main reason is that it isnt depend on proprietary ml framework despite the good lectures the assignments dont help you develop the knowledge required for ml developer roletaking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery from summer  to summer  finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled im completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience	0
this is an informative and effective course that boosts confidence and motivation for starting more complex and lengthier subjects very enjoyable to watch im planning on rewatching this course sporadically after completed to maintain the powerful study skills i have gained and for the inspirational optional interviews included	4
this course hasnt been upgraded to python  ive been following along using python  code myself but its  and python  reaches end of life in  years at 	1
i enjoyed this course and appreciated the fact that not all the assignments were multiple choice it was great to be able to develop ideas through the case studies and exercises i would have liked if actual tas would review our work instead of other classmates but i realize this might be unrealistic due to the high number of people enrolled in the course	3
very informative and interesting	4
initially gets very boring but at the end gives you more information about where to orient yourself some useful information	3
it is very us oriented which is not necessarily a negative aspect but please mention that in the course structure more clearly although professor warburg is very inspiring the optimistic attitude towards policy leaders is what i think is needed for the younger generation who get sidelined by politics and not policy it was quite rewarding thankyou	3
great introduction to python and programming very accessible for everybody	4
the course is too short and not really detailed but very informative and too bad you can receive a statement of accomplishment	3
lectures were extremely good but assignments and graders were very low quality and difficult to decipher requirements from professors and tas were not active in the forums	1
good introduction of working with tabular data in pandas dataframes ive learnt how to access columns rows and specific values in a dataframe how to transform the data and how to merge dataframes together the assignments are a lot of doityourself by reading documentation and qa sites so youre forced to read a lot and learn more than actually necessary teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped could have been better if part of the solution is given eg answer   without actually giving the full answer i also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly it would have been better that way because i could review the strengths and weaknesses of the methods i used to get to the answer	2
 not worth the money and time the reason i say this is because the same concepts are reviewed and explained in lot more fun creative and interactive manner at other free of cost resources like khan academy youtube channels etc who is the audience i dont think instructor has any idea of target audience are these meant for novice or advanced learners  why so serious my philosophy is that if i want to appear in video i better learn to cheer up seriously i mean after dealing with rush hour traffic and psychopath boss i dont want to see a unhappy serious looking face throughout a course not good for my heartsorry if it is a mean not statistic mean or anything but i have come here investing my money and time out of my family time  and i am not happy with this coursethe only reason i have to complete this course is because of the requirement in specialization degree i wont mind getting my refund back on this course	0
the course was short and to the point which helped me understanding the use of punctuations specially comma and semi colon and different types of sentence structures and variety	3
the teacher is amazing and the content is interesting and makes me want to pursue law however the classmates are extremely aggregating and track you down to give you low scores in order that they themselves may succeed i cannot explore my interests with this sort of setting	1
lessons were ok but the assignments were really frustrating not because of the questions itself but because the questions were organised badly or were really vague and confusing	0
challenging if not a developer and grader needs very specific code that aside this was a fun interesting course great intro to bluemix and nodered and js need to allow significant time to research around content taught and decomposing programming assignments takes time make use of forums and post queries  peers answer as well as staff you learning in ibm suggests  hours  most on forums were taking  hours per assignment overall this was a good intro course	3
the code for the final assignment is peer reviewed which doesnt make sense it should be reviewed by either a ta or some kind of application than can verify what youve done also the assignments were a bit of a leap from the video tutorials at times	1
i feel that i need more explanation about the code i dont feel capable to solve different problems on my own	3
i think the content was quite interesting as someone new to marketing i was really looking forward to the lectures and exercises however the content was simply too much for me to complete its a bit ironic that a course about marketing missed its market to give a bit more detail there were  video lectures  assignments that had to be done days before the end of the week to be peerreviewed and then i had to peer review others work while also going through all the assigned reading it seemed more like a courseload for a full time student or perhaps a parttime student as online students typically are neither im surprised the course content wasnt better managed i take a lot of notes so perhaps thats what slowed me down but i also have a full time job and i intern on the weekends i was hoping this course could easily be done in the evening hours other coursera courses provided an excellent balance of content and courseload im disappointed that this course wasnt one of them it seemed very useful and interesting	1
learned quite a bit but course was not as good as the first course of the specializationespecially the presentations in week  are rather messy	2
great overview of machine learning it was helpful to understand the concepts at a high level	4
compliments the course introduced me to a number of reporting and research tools that i was not aware of i have also become a great fan of avinash kaushik and his blog in the processcriticism the lecturer could have gone into more details in many areas of his course as opposed to just assuming that the prescribed reading material had been read many detailed points were glanced over and one prescribed reading material peterson e t  web analytics demystified was written in  and as a result much of the information presented in this text book is very outdated	2
it was a very well presented description of what iot is and specificsit does not go into details that need special knowledge but it is also not boring for someone that comes from electrical  electronics field	4
i think whole course was well explained but sometimes i had a hard time to get a key point in videos	3
html and css is good js search for another course	0
too short too expensive	2
my expectations were different	0
the course material was good but the lectures being in spanish with english translations was difficult to follow i was disappointed in the short videos with subtitles	2
very poorly structured purely academic and dull as dishwater buddhist meditation is a profoundly beautiful tradition but there is no beating heart here i gave up quickly	0
overall is was a nice course but could be a bit more clear in the last  assignments something different was shown in the assignment video than what was written on the assignment paper	3
the syllabus is nice for three weeks coursebut you have missed many more important topics like forms etcplease try to include them in futureanyways  teaching is good	2
i learned a lot about deep learning however the quiz contains several mistakes and i wasted many hours i also thought explanation is unnecessarily hard to understand	1
the course material is funny and easy to follow it breaks down important aspects of game design into easy chunks and assignments as for reviews i feel like you get back what put in if you make the effort for someone else you will get in return	3
the instructors were not very engaging	1
the course is not that much helpful for those who want to do work for coding i mean the level of toughness of questions is not too good to compete any coding competition	2
very very introductory i didnt find the tooling aspects of this course particularly helpful but im not in the target audience its length was misleading  i completed the work in two days easily but i am a technologist and already had the tools installed if you use github and rstudio the meat of the course is only about an hour of the lecture	1
a little too superficial and hand waving	2
boring assaignments	1
its quite simple and doesnt show specific steps of how to do it	2
this mooc offers some great tools and tips for all social media marketers or just enthusiasts out there great thorough content will referenced and a great experience all together	4
this teacher is an amateur	1
great faculty and course content	3
its a good but timid introduction to game development with unity it addresses many relevant game development concepts like programming collision detection and d coordinates it course may be better appreciated if taken as part of a specialization	2
very interesting courses with a good theory basis in portfolio manangement	3
this course is quite outdated i didnt learn much beyond what i already knew before i started the spark courses from edx are way better than these hopefully big data analysis with scala and spark from the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne also from coursera is good i know their scala courses which are taught by martin odersky are quite goodthere are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challengingmany of the videos specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over they serve more as a review if you know the subject otherwise i dont think most people will get much from themthe audio isnt very good for most of the lectures many having an very annoying chirping sound from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer tehtehteh tehtehteh tehtehteh tehtehhhhhh gosh i havent heard this sound in maybe over five years	1
better than the first but it looks like each element was created in a single day some segments were repetitive and dragged on though the instructor seemed both personable and knowledgeable when the only visual is the instructor it gets hard to watch an interesting model of both what to do and what not to do in creating your own online course	2
solid course very handson accomplishes its goals	3
overall good course clean and elegant style of presentation some videos had some echo problems with the sound also there were some english typos in some slides and in video quizzes that should be corrected i would like to seen the slides for the presentations also if this is going to be a series of courses wouldnt it make sense to bundle it in a specializationnonetheless congratulations and thank you for presenting this course in coursera	2
mapping of software product manager to scrum master is imho not correct some misunderstanding by introduction of scrum eg customer is not a part of the scrum teampreparing of a part of an university course by a bachelor of computer science	1
trying to cover many subjects and diving deep into less interesting areasthe lectures themselves are very clear and easy to understand accompanies with good decks	2
wonderful course especially for nonfinance professionals very friendly in learning take enough time out to go and deeply understand the terms and concepts explained this will provide a good headstart cheers vaidya nathan sir you are amazing gotta meet you some time	3
this course is too basic and superficial i think already high school students can figure out the tips by themselves	1
i expected more practical exercises but i did learn some	1
great course they feed us in small morsels and you can stop the video and write some code yourself	4
i havent applied for a certificate but i really enjoyed the lessons the course is clearly structured and the videos are very well done	4
great lessons with very explained materialthe major downside for this course is the terrible sound quality it just cant be heard with regular speakers you have to hear it with earspeakers and it still not that great	3
great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization im afraid i need to be a little bit critical with this one though the contents are really jammed into  weeks  the last weeks contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose https authentication and baas not a single quiz or selfevaluation of sorts along the course  to be completely fair the exercises shown along the way might make up for it still i think its important to spread some quizes around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively the quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses theres even a video towards the end of the course where a linkedin notification springs up on top which even makes the presenter pause for a few secondsdont get me wrong i really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it  given the newly introduced coursera fees id expect much more quality in place to make it  buckworth though	2
boring	0
autograding would have been a better option in this course	3
it has a lot of problems including not so many lectures about excel itself  most of the time you will be watching videos about statistic methods the lectures are very superficial even though the quizzes and projects demand a lot of knowledge and time the course seems to have a staff of one man the professor of the course rarely replies even though he did at the beginning of the session and all the work seems to be done by his assistant who tries his best but ends up not coping with all the questions asked at the discussion forums	1
good practical materials which help to better understand the theories from previous courses	3
too uscentric very strange concept of nonmonetary benefits it very common to forgo cash remuneration for nonmonetary benefits mainly for tax advantages which was largely ignored in this course	0
interesting concepts and introduction to the specialization but i wish the lectures were more natural and energetic	2
excellent and very useful course for all business professionals	4
colleen van lent phd courses have been the best courses i have taken and the first i have completed her classes offer you what you need and are practical in actually learning the subject matter ive taken several other classes on the same topics and have not gotten as far or learned as much	4
too high level the course is	1
wonderful course on research principles and the creation of reproducible r reports with knitr	4
there is a lot of selfteaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions in addition the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding at times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code this is definitely not a beginner coder course and i do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before	2
i drop at the beginning of the javascript before javascript everything is good after javascript what are they talking about	0
this course was an excellent way to begin immersing myself into the specialization i am new to this field but can imagine myself using much of my printed out material as future reference	4
the course has given me great insight in how best to motivate my team as well as understand what would motivate me	3
good material and practical ideas for the daytoday use at work	2
i felt the initial splash screen was a bit time consuming also lot of the knowledge felt like more bookish could have been different styles of management and approaches or even how leaders in the past like dale carneige would have approached this course has a lot of potential and i feel revising the next version would make it so much better for novice program managers	1
very nice introduction to databases and data warehouses the lectures are not very engaging the plus is there are practical assignments for every week where you learn the most first you submit your own solution and then you provide feedback to your peers i like the format of the assignments what i dislike giving  stars instead of  is difficulty in setting up the environment for assignments to complete  it took me longer just to properly install the software needed for assignments  and  than to work out the assignments the lectures could be also improved	3
i advice not to take this coursewhy the professor is never there to read your assignments he leaves that totally to other students like yourself to grade your written assignments and they do not read and give you a random grade in  secondsdont take it you will waste sooo much time on this one	0
this is a an important topic and more scientists and students in the sciences should learn about this but the quizzes are not great as a learning aid and my motivation is running through lows	2
it was good experience to enhance my knowledge	3
excellent course must be for all people interested in expertising this domain	4
week  and  lectures are robotic  most material taken directly from the internet it is just a form of regurgitation of online articles from strategy consulting firms with quizs artificially made more difficult with cheap word plays the lecturer for week  and week  should resign with immediate effect and find a job at a school for lower class students where she can continue to brag about her industry expertise without being so irritating definitely not ie business school material 	1
really interesting subject presented in an entertaining way	3
sorry for my englishso many people looking forward to take this course and was very cold robotic full of theoretical and repetitive texts	1
this is a great course with tons of valuable info the peerreview projects are very handson and you learn a lot by doing that however i wish there were more explanations for certain things for example for the experiments section  or at least more resources to get further info also for assignment  it would have been very helpful to have the answer key since there is some confusion around some of the answers	3
challenging but i learned a lot	3
wonderful course the professor is teaching in a good manner and clarifies every single detail the curse is entertaining and useful thank you	4
great explanation i am very satisfied	4
didnt find it very interesting because of language interpretation issues the content was good though	1
i wanted this course to focus specifically on strategies for engaging young readers but it did not additionally the method of assignment sharing is a file uploaddownload dropbox i had fully intended to participate until i saw that as a mooc i realize that there could be any number of individuals registering for this course using false information and uploading nefarious scripts that could hijack my computer should i download something from here no thanks coursera epic fail	1
teacher doesnt teach what is on the quizzes _	1
this class is very easy it is a decent introduction but has very little content it is clearly made to be accessible to people from all around the world and takes the content very slowly the test questions ask you to recite information from the video lectures and reading rather than thinking critically it seems like they are just trying to make sure you watchedread the content and understood it rather than making sure you acquired the knowledge i guess it would be hard to grade essay questions in a class this big but the content could go a little faster	2
its a good class and i learned a lot the learning curve shoots up exponentially around the fourth week i could see this course being perfect if broken down into two classes	2
great course	4
pretty bad as far as i am conerned i spent two days clicking back and forth and listening to a lot of talk that taught me nothing sorry about that but there are better courses on the internet than this one	0
great start to the tools	3
the course is too superficial it isnt worth the mo	1
good topics just poorly structured i found the exercises easier than the previous module but the lectures were worse i ended up watching  lecture on week  and again on week   none of the other lecture content was relevant to the exercises would have loved a decent explanation of a monad and their usages but it really felt out of place in this course no exercises on monadsafter completing the first two courses i dont feel like i would bother with the next ones the course content is far to academic and i would get far more from a book	2
good overview of topic videos well presented poorly worded quizzes refers you to outside site where they want you to pay to access further material regarding actual fraud stories that they tease with a part of the story each week	3
 stars because the theoretical part is ok but programming assignments are waste of time im not here and paid to be trained to use something the instructor is trying to sell nor will i ever recommend this product for commercial use i will switch to other not recommended packages in the later parts of this specializationthey should put the disclaimer for graphlab create in the specialization page so people can be aware of thisbesides the sound of that giraffe toy is really really annoying	1
very informative course totally worth the time investment	4
i think that it would be a good idea to improve the grader release more informative assignment information take a look at the algorithms course for example and lecture materials in pdf format	0
very helpful frameworks delivered in a great way could be made better still by more in the way of materials and assignments to engage with quizzes are fine but dont allow the thought engagement of case studies one can work through even if ungraded	3
amazing course i would recommend it to be taken by all thank you for providing such an awesome and useful course thanks a ton	4
there is much to praise nice mapwork a steady and organized march through time and some interesting case studies i especially enjoyed the lecture on henry adamshowever the title is a complete misnomer as the course is regrettably white bread history i found the approach stale and westerncentric as the content actually covers western europe and the stretch of its influence through the time period i also found myself questioning the veracity of many conclusions as the lecture often had difficulty citing more than a couple specific points of evidence for his arguments	2
thank you for the interesting courseone thing that this course lacks in my opinion is the division of the lecture material in smaller parts it is easier to proceed when the videos are about  minutes long than  you can always stop in between those parts without the need to remember the last minute of the video you watched and also to feel closure since the part has been checked as completedthanks again i wish your course improves and stays successful	3
i loved this instructor she is very knowledgeable and articulates the terms and methods well	4
not useful learned very little from it	1
too expensive for such a simple course	0
ive taken several statistics data science and r courses this is one of the worst i took others advice and i also strongly suggest looking to other sources to learn statistical inference before taking this course khan academy datacamp udacity duke coursera and columbia edx all have great courses though they vary in depth each leaves you with a good understanding of the concepts they teach	0
in my opinion this course was way too theoretical i wish we had more examples and practical exercises after four courses in a row i was expecting much more skills rather than theoretical discussions all the way long	2
the sequence of the learning movie are not good and some times while teaching the the movie is endedbesides rather than educational material this course refer to several website	0
professor harris does a good job overall but he does not explain python syntax in depth i audited the course and found it quite simple however i recommend a paid subscription to get the most out of it	2
bad audio qualitypoor presentationnot for professional developers perhaps can be fine for beginners	0
i learned this machine learning course this is my second course about machine learningpros  mathematical backgrounds are well introduced if their proof is quite long the proof is omitted  this course provides chance to construct major machine learning formulas using matlaboctave  resources offered at last seem to be very useful to deepen my study on machine learning i am going to use the references as a compasscons  audio quality is poor as an english learner as a second language this makes me spend more time to capture the meaning of speech 	3
for what you pay for this course is not worth it while i was able to follow the lectures the material is very introductory and i was hoping to learn more the lectures are really short in duration and the quizzes arent challenging i feel that pricing of this specialization is purely due to the brand name of wharton please improve this specialization to encompass more depth in the course material or lower the price	1
the course is useful and very clear for beginners it aims to explain what is the type of reasoning behind the programmingthanks	4
ive already written a review for part  and i have the same opinion about this one the course is rather poor and not challenging only general information about relevant topics that as well read on wikipedia no exercises no code assignments a lot of this content was repeated from first two parts of this specialization	0
this course takes an alternate approach to understanding modern art moving it away from categories based on the time period in which art was made or what school the artist was part of and instead groups art work by theme i really enjoyed all the pieces i encountered and felt like i had a somewhat better understanding of modern art after taking this course	2
there are steps that are missing at times which require you to scour for help there are also quirks that arent mentioned that other students have to point out unaddressed questions in the discussion board required escalation feels rushed and its hard to learn for a beginner feels like youre just going through the motions and copy and pasting code	1
reasonably good but less structured and organized that the first coursei hope the next one will be better on this aspect	2
con i feel i spent most of the time learning graphlab suggest replace it with standard python as the standard tool for this class provide any needed additional code in standard python course is better in the front end than in the back end week  is significantly more involved than previous weeks suggest divide week  into two sessions neural network and nearest neighbor applying neural network results imagenet  was mentioned and not explained therefore the nearest neighbor homework assignment from the students perspective does not have much to do with neural network other than using the results from imagenet  which was not explained in any detail anyway this will allow more time to delve into the forward and backward propagation which should have been explained in more details home assignments are not best worded especially homework assignment for week  suggest reword in shorter statements that are more to the point programming presentation and assignments can seem like exercise in graphlab and sframe functions rather than machine learningpro class presentation by professor fox on recommender system is detailed and clear classifier block diagram shown by professor guestrin is good clearly distinguishing training the classifier and the subsequent use of the classification prediction neural network quiz in week  is excellent it drills down on the multidimensional space that neural network is particularly good for	1
it is a kind of introduction course as it was mentioned on course info however it is very basicif there would be follow up courses about the same topic it is a good start otherwise that is not a learning based lecturethank you for your understandingdeniz ozalp	1
the course material was interesting but the total lack of support forces me to give it only one star i left the following complaint in the general forum for this course  months ago neither coursera the instructor or any moderator ever responded many people were not able to run the software supplied in the course because of bugs but the solution was left to the student i have taken good courses on line before but this is not one of themit seems that the dr tucker balch andor the moderators have totally abandoned this course but coursera keeps offering it and collecting moneythe neither instructor or nor the moderators have posted on the meet and greet forumthe instructor andor moderators have answered no questions posted on any forumthe qstk software bugs have not been addressed by the instructor or the moderators only students have answered these forum questionscomputational investing part ii is coming shortly that is what they said  years ago further evidence of abandonment	0
its a fail	0
dr hare speaks really clearly and with a lot of enthusiasm the information the course brings is really interesting and kind of unexpected i really enjoyed it	4
i really learned many things in this course it will surely help beginning teachers start their year with a bang and will be able to end their year with an explosion that will help themselves and their learners bring out the best and will be able to have a year of meaningful and productive school year	4
i learnt a lot in this class it was always something i wanted to accomplish i learnt that you must have a lot of memory and hard drive space on your pc to run the emulator i also think that the new studio android studio is better than eclipse i loved the forums because they solved most of the problems i had i would like the instructors and mentors to answer questions in a timely manner	3
another great social norms social change online course	3
this course is very useful and practicable despite of some obvious things at the beginning and not very useful additional videos i have already started to apply the knowledge i received during this wonderful course and i will certainly pass this knowledge to my relatives and friends to enhance their ability to learn and be smarter thank you very much barbara and teren thank you very much entire team who took part in organization of the course and definitely big thank you to coursera for such marvelous opportunities in online studying	4
you are great thank you 	4
very very difficult quizzes are quite easy to accomplish but the practical takeaway from each week is small i would have preferred if the course focused on getting the resultsdata and keeping the statistical analysis to a few most common areastoo academic more focus on practice use	1
this is an awesome course and i really enjoy learning python	4
good course for understanding the basics of project management good teacher and good materials	3
this was much less about the development of games as it was an intro to unity furthermore the assignments werent graded on a timely basis which left very room to collaborate and refine overall i felt like i learned to follow a few basic things about unity nothing more	1
well structured easy to follow	4
excelent and advanced explications thanks a lot	4
good course if you do not have any idea about big data and the technology used	2
this was a good introduction to the principles and concepts of project management i completed this course as part of professional development for my current job and learned some good terminology and best practices if you have experience with project management or want to learn more advanced concepts i imagine this course would not be for you if youre looking for a good introduction to project management that you can build on later this is a good place to start	3
very confusing stuff need better clarification in course description and the way the material is transmitted to the student need to be reconsideredbut very well made and interesting	1
fantastic course learnt allot	3
this course really need examples in final assignment	2
the course content is not up to date the course software tools updated  years ago and the second part of the course does not cover in the same depth the topics it aims to cover	2
great as an introduction for many things but unfortunately it is not possible to keep on developing the themes presented on the lectures because there is no access to the sources used without a functional bibliography for the course the full potential for learning of those enroled is tragically cut	2
good materials	4
the course gives practice in python but programming assignments were loaded with busy work that added little value and often had only loose ties to the material discussed in class while this forces more independent learning it also makes it so that this course isnt really much better than free online tutorials i found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from google searches that led to stackoverflow for an instructor from the university of michigan whose bio says i work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education i was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class i suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research its often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer student objectives	1
too much talking in a lot of these course offerings i have add and i cannot take excessive talking	0
meat we need more meat where is the beefrecommendation one question what should a medium to small business do after a iot hack walk this through as an exercise this question can be part of a whole program exercise	3
interesting concepthowever in my opinion there is sometimes a lack of  practice especially for the coding part entire courses are exclusively theoretical explanations during the courses i have heard several times this sentence  dont ask me why which is disappointing in my learner experience and frustrating not to get the answers i was expecting subject mastering the teacher seems to be lost sometimes and admits not being able to explain some parts of the course which may confuse and demotivate learners not knowing exactly what they are being teached and how it worksmoreover in the courses covering database subject security issues are involved example week   c video how to send a roar from the app to the internet	1
the course structure is not thoughtfully prepared there is a lot of confusion around what the instructor wants to say the practice quizzes and course content have no match whatsoever	0
good practical examples of the concepts in general seems to me that the courses of the specializations do not fit together well at times basic things mentioned elsewhere are repeated some others are not explained sufficiently	2
wonderful course cant wait to start part  of the series	4
helpful insight	2
interesting course ill advice anyone in the marketing field to take this course	3
very little content most of the value comes from working on games for the assignments	2
thoroughly enjoyed it	4
the teacher is not very good at explaining things in simpler terms the lessons were kind of hard to understand	2
too much version specific detailsinstructor was reading slides vs explaining the technologies  telling a story the quiz part cant be more lame	0
the content is absolutely amazing what i didnt really like was that the last assignment was a curve ball to me and most of the other students in my class there was very little preparation to it and thus took a while to understand how to get started on it	3
exceptional course this is challenging material for me but its presented in such a coherent manner that you cant help but absorb it	4
introductory course	1
i thought this was a good course dr chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project	2
i found week  binary classification really confusing it was just not clear specifics were not given definitions were not given poorly instructed	1
i would not recommend this one to any paying customer this is the second intro to graphic design class i have take on coursera and i found the way the material was presented in the calarts course to be quite slow and pretty boring our assignments were simple and i felt no excitement in doing them it would have been beneficial to see how these fundamental building blocks could be used in real life design the other class by cuboulder made me want to continue learning and i felt excited to complete the projects whereas with this class i was forcing myself to sit down to finish just the required ones	0
the course was very useful and interesting as well  i always like when people talk about whats there to discover and work out yet not only what we already know	4
this course is so rich in content and all this is delivered with great clarity and depth just wonderful	4
the course is going good	3
startinng it now	0
course is ok not too informative and not too poor	2
very useful and learnt lot of important concepts	3
its great to learn from someone so high up in the industry and knowledgeable in this field	3
nice approach needed more organized content	2
an excellent course to breeze through for getting a disciplined knowledge in accessing web data with python	4
this course was nothing like true tibetan buddhism which is my religion  please consider canceling it immediatly or having me or a real lama as the teacher	0
good course but need more details	2
so ill start with the positives the material was appropriate and interesting and well presented cj taylor is an enthusiastic lecturer and the material was presented in an enjoyable easy to understand way and having finished the course i definitely want to learn more about computational motion planningthe problems i have with this course though are numerous this is the second part of the robotics specialization and compared to the first part this course was very weak there was very little lecture material and the course felt thin  as if it were  weeks of material stretched over  there were many instances where the lectures could have gone in to much more detail and just didnt i appreciate that you cant cover everything in lectures but would it have killed you to provide or at least point to some good additional reading resourcesthe assessments were the worst part the quizzes barely tested what i had learnt and could mostly be solved by common sense what i find shocking is that there were so few questions with few multiple choice answer that you could easily bruteforce these quizzes if you really wanted to compare this to the aerial robotics course where the quizzes took time and forced me to think and understand what was discussed in lecturethe programming assignments were shockingly bad they were hard for completely the wrong reasons i spent most of my time on them not coding the solution but trying to figure out what was actually wanted and fixing bugs that were in the provided code that we werent even supposed to edit the autograder would never tell you why you were wrong just im sorry your solution didnt pass all of our test cases this meant that finding the solution was based on guesswork rather than considered thought this was made even worse by the fact that some simulations took a long time to run which made iterating guesses very slow  and doing this on a time limit is just pointlessly stressfulone of the assignments had the solution already in the source code as the instructors had forgotten to take it outthe final assignment wouldnt even run out of the box without fixing bugs in the provided code this would have taken seconds to check had the person who wrote it bothered to check their work beforehandthing is the tasks provided in principle werent that hard they were actually kind of too easy dijkstras algorithm isnt that difficult to implement from scratch and yet all that was asked of us was to implement a small  line forloop that said i appreciate that as a software engineer i might find this sort of thing much easier than most but even so i dont feel as though the programming assignments helped me learn anythingoverall regardless of how interesting the material was this course was very shoddily put together i appreciate this is the first time the course has been run but this really felt phoned in and unacceptable i paid money for this course and the quality of it is notably worse than most free moocs i have taken i feel ripped off and i sincerely hope that the next section is better otherwise i doubt i will bother to continue until the end i thought penn university was better than this	1
outstanding i have been an educator and consultant for decades but this course taught me new things about how to learn effectively and how to be productive the references are valuable too every learner and every parent of a learner will benefit from learning how to learn with this course	4
i feel like were left behind by the teachers of this course the teaching style does not help in getting the right code to work	2
great and insightful course	4
unfortunately this specific course lacks indepth information and problems and exercises in order to get an individual to explore the wide subject that is statistics	0
ive learned structures of python and get greatest motivation for programming and data analysis	4
kind of okay but	0
the assignment for week  should have been the last assignment in this sequence and was not clearly explained or taught in the videos	2
the lectures from week  to week  are nice and useful to me but i think there should be more details about the content in week  for example i think the lecture about the jeffreys prior skipped many things and i did not understand this concept very well	2
very low material not enough examples  full emails	0
in my opinion this is a decent introductory course but i feel it relies too heavily on the bootstrap framework and not enough basic fundamentals are taught there is a lot happening within any framework and understanding the how and why of web design is just as important as getting the final product	2
it was more about learning dato then any insight however i understand that this course is good motivator for beginners but was very boring for me	3
basic introduction to data science	2
i think this course should be named basic ios programmingthe course doesnt provide professional ui design just teach some basic which human interface guideline hasalso the instructor doesnt seem ios expertise	0
much expected from this course but this course is not up to the mark	1
thanks a lotand im very happy for this course	4
i liked the topics however ive liked this course to review the concepts of forms and the types associated radio buttons combobox etc	2
while i learned quite a bit from the course i found the course to be far more difficult and frustrating than it really needed to be mentors were unhelpful and generally unresponsive during the course course content was broken andor missing and the level of background in both calculusprobability needed to truly understand the material in this course was not obvious at all from the beginning in general the holistic experience of this course was disappointing and frankly i would not recommended it unless you have a strong enough math background or are a glutton for punishment	0
got as far as lesson six took test and received  have been trying without success to retake the test there does not seem to be anywhere to try and find out how to fix this	0
a bit too basic	2
maybe not enough content to be a course	2
i really liked this course i am glad i chose this as my first online course	4
very clear	4
more detailed explanation possible on the whole very patiently taught by the professor	3
perfect courses by this course i have learnt many things about machine learning true it is so wonderful that andrew ng could take many abstract concepts into some straightforward things thanks a lots i can guarantee that if you could insist on completing this course totally you would find youve mastered many useful knowledge of course knowledge is endless if youre really interested in this field then go for it by as many methods as possible you can find and dont restrict yourself to this course	4
very clear and easy to understand i really loved	4
amateurish presentation and there is some technical issue with the content the video gets stuck a lot and the problem is not my internet	0
very informative course coming from someone with no computer programing background	4
so easy	0
bad explanations nothing you can do at exams without researching from external sources	1
i was excited to learn a bit about using documentbased databases and json parsing and transport however for me the approach in this course was very dry and i found the material goals and teaching style to be a confusing jumble it seemed like each sectionmodule did not feel like a cohesive package with each one building upon the last	1
a bit too basic and quiz questions did not reflect the real value of what was being learnt but was just poised at encouraging us to memorize sequences of facts more than anything	3
very good overview of us energy and how the facts should shape policy	4
incredibly comprehensive learning package which makes learning and skills acquisition easier kudos to the creators and instructors	3
great course	4
the amount of information covered in this course is just right for a beginner but it suffers because one the lectures are boring and lifeless can you imagine graphics design being boring and two the examples are uninspiring they couldve done better than use the same circles squares and triangles to explain various concepts its hard to get excited about a topic when the presentation is this dull and did i mention the lecturer doesnt even look directly at the viewer its like theyre looking at a monitor or camera on the side so its like hes talking to somebody elseso in summary basic concepts and information are there yes and its free so take it and check out the others in the series its just that execution couldve been a lot better	1
it was great though tough	3
excellent and very dense to really benefit must be revisited when putting in practice	4
the course is good but it does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand	1
too much theoretical probably this is not the course i was looking for when i joined it nevertheless i will try to get some concepts from it particularly for what concerns the practice of meditation and mindfulness	0
im quite disappointed in this course first you should know that the first week doesnt reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter as i was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon i started the second week i was wondering what happen to the clear concise examples and ideas presented in the first one first the presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view its barely readable  it allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed that could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly its not the case most of the time the examples are rarely connected to something real numbers come up from  nowhere the level of difficulty could be challenging if you dont have a bachelor of sciences like math or physics or bio its not a beginner courseto give more context i have done and succeed more  courses   specializations followedaudited about  others courses and that is the first time im giving a bad review im sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course  there is a lot subjects presented but i definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples with some changes that course will fly high 	0
linking programming language to hardware sucks do not waste time on this course	0
first professor was incredibly good at giving an overview over design choices in data visualizationssecond professor sadly somehow spoke too fast and had less of a red thread through his presentationsthe first and second week of courses were good the third week however was too hypothetical and onesided	3
i would prefer to learn about less smm tools more in depth rather then getting to know so many just briefly felt a little bit overwhelmed	2
very nice and well organized course feel the touch of care in the whole course thank you professor and team	4
this course is supposed to be the most interesting and most challenged one of this specialization however i am quite disappointed with the instructor and the contents he put together he speaks too fast without much clarity and worst of all i can tell most of the time he reads from the scripts without really conveying much knowledge about the contents	0
this serves well as a basic intro but not for people who are looking for a deeper dive	2
plus for practical tips a bit too little focus on the mathematics minus for slightly buggy lecture videos	3
not of a worth	0
we tried to use this class to teach a brown bag lunch for our employees interested in programming python is a great language but this class has a very low content to volume ratio nobody wants to watch the instructor meet his lifetime idol at a tradeshow or watch the intel versus amd meltdown commercials over their lunch break	0
very poor explanations	0
i hope it will involve statistics analysis in the capstone project it is kind of bias to apply nlp knowledge and develop data product in the capstone project	1
quite useless i didnt feel that i learned anything at all assingments seem to be dessinged by someone very lazy the limitations of the assingments do not allow the students to practice what its been tought but it is asked in the peer assingment from the students to evaluate it i understand that when calling it introduction it is supposed to be aimed for people totally starting from  but still i cant see how this course is of any use it is short and does not cover anything i am very surpirsed that getting the certificate for this course costs the same in  than getting the certificate of the introduction to principles of game design principles of game design has more than double hours of classes and in the assingments you actually create a game and practice new stuff this course was very dissappointing	0
could have been awesome course if it discussed some detailed approaches only  panning approaches discussed in  weeks thus disappointing	0
thank you so much	4
the exams and projects are really really hard and make r newbies such as i feel very suffering and these contents are not connect to the teaching materials closely i think there is large space to improve this course to make it more accessible and learnable	1
learning materials are poorly delivered codes given are bugridden this in turn makes it incredibly difficult to follow on disappointing	1
in terms of how the course was presented i liked it compared to the usual lecturing style however the content was below basic for someone in the field of health	1
not being allowed to submit quizzes without paying for the course  i am withdrawing from the course and any other coursera courses where this is the policy  i will enrol in other free online course sites where the are free	0
great mooc	4
this was a decent course some informative big picture information but i felt that it lacked some hands on understanding the minor hands on labs that were provided were challenging for anyone that is not familiar with python script writing i would suggest that you brush up on that before being comfortable with taking this course	2
goodtopicsbadpresentation poor sound unprepared and unrehearsed presentations long intros unjustified use of greenscrenns etcshallow with regards to the theoretical aspects of what it is presentedassignments are mechanical easier than the tutorial and you have to perform the same tasks for different constants for several times	0
thanks to prof charles severance his approach on teaching makes things easier to understand and he helped me gain a better way of seeing the code and think right i am so encouraged to learn more and gain solid skills with following series of this coursethanksall the bestselcuk ozmumcu	4
lessons seemed to be very simple	2
helpful tips but this course should be free	2
i wish it had more interaction with the teachers or to at least have more level of detail on the cases i am afraid tha as a final project it was not of a very high use for me	2
very good course best explanation on financial models i have ever seen learn about sharpe ratio etc in the most visual and simplest explanation you will ever seen in the whole internet and youtube	4
considering the contents of the second and third course this was too basic	2
gail swanlund is awesome her voice is amazing and fun to listen to she explains things in a very creative way so far this has been my favorite among the graphic design specialization courses still have two more courses to go yet	3
aimed only for people with zero background in the iot paradigm while well organized and structured it only provides the student with the minimum basics of the iot and embedded systems concepts	1
quizes were poorly worded	0
this specialization is delayed for months now  very annoying dont give them money	0
good course but final project asks a lot for what this course is	2
the course is very superficial in nature and there is no difficulty	0
this course is for people who are already relatively happy tasks are impossible for those who are not happy personally i couldnt define happines and couldnt remember anyone who i am grateful to	1
the course started a month late when it finally started it was boring i can believe i paid for the certificate despite paying for it im not going to bother completing it	0
incredibly frustrated by the peer grading system ive been able to work on the course at relatively fast pace and have now completed all of the lectures readings quizzes and test but cant go on to the next course because not enough people have submitted the homework for me to grade i understand the advantage of being able to learn from others but it doesnt outweigh the disadvantage of not being able to work at ones own pace 	1
good focus on ideas vs principles the focus on relational algebra is a great way to look at data manipulation in general unfortunately relational algebra is explained quite well but not really applied after that this could be a great course if it really taught to constantly think in terms of relational algebraokayish explanations of databases and hadoop not very deep and not always structured but rather focused on the technology principles instead of the data principlesi think that this specialisation suffers the same problem most data sciencemininganalytics courses suffer it ignores the nontechnical starting point scientific or business relevance how does one organise data get to know completely new data understand possible value ie how to start a data science project if all there is is unorganised data and the wish to do something with it	1
it is not free they just sell the certificates there is not any free statement about accomplishment of the course so nobody will knows that you have completed it in the future you have not got anything to show in your cvi want my statement of accomplishment	0
personally i strongly doubt that putting a bunch of slides and a few autograded exercises is the best way to learn about logic why then stanford university doesnt just email his students this material and let them work on their own instead of doing lecturesi dont see the added value at all apart from being able to discuss the topic in the forum with other online students whats the advantage in comparison to buying a book and doing the exercises therethis course to me started off with the wrong foot no info on the starting date of the course until the end of september when instead the course was supposed to start at the beginning of the month and now the complete absence of videos this to me seems more like a fuck up on the side of coursera which didnt find an agreement with stanford university so no material had been produced until now then in order not to completely ruin its reputation coursera put a bunch of slides calling it an online course and expecting people to buy this liei might be wrong and this could be only my theory and nothing else however i wont recommend coursera to anyone after this very bad feedback so far and the funny thing is that i had big expectations before the starthope this will be taken as constructive feedback and not as a complaint	0
first of all thank you for the course as it enables students to get a bit more uptodate and knowledgeable in the topicon the other hand unfortunately its not worth ones time as it didnt deliver very good quality nor on its promise regarding the big pictureproseasy to understandselfpacedobjectivity and positive overall messageconsoverall quality and clarity of the lectures is not very good lectures are a bit hard to follow not because of the complexity of the topic but because of some controversial and outdated data and the speaking and presentation style of the lecturerassignments contain too many trivial questions but also some mistakes which makes some questions impossible to answer correctly based on the lectures or at allno staff engagement or feedback on the forums which is especially problematic regarding to aforementioned mistakesthe title and description of the course dont inform students that it is completely uscentric and mostly concentrating on petroleumoil so along with a lot of important topics the big picture is missing	1
unfortunately as often happens what is simple and basic for one is not that for another this course presumes a comfortableness with coding that i simply do not possess as a teacher of high school science please try and develop a true introductory course that normal nonprogrammers can access thanks	0
looks like its prealpha version of what it might be	0
overall a good course for selfstudy the assignments in particular are excellent for data cleaning analysis and interpretation the quizzes are very basic though and appear to be there only to check if the student has gone through the lectures the knowledge needed to answer the quizzes and achieve the desired results in the assignments are vastly different and should be addressedthe case studies at the end are insightful and more use could be made of them in a more advanced course there is a lot of repetition of concepts throughout the course and this can become distracting the format for the lecture videos varies throughout and this inconsistency along with extreme audio volume changes also becomes distractingother than that excellent for driving the need for reproducible research rr home presenting and explaining some tools available to achieve rr and ways of publishing resultsreports from these studies	2
great learning experience	4
perfectthanks a lot	4
decent course could be put together a lot nicer	2
excellent course very easy to understandhats off to madam ilkay altintas and sir amarnath gupta for explaining the big data concepts in such a simple way 	4
increase the difficulties	2
the course itself is fine the quizzes however are so frustrating as to lower the enjoyment of the whole thing numerous answers are just factually wrong you end up retaking the quiz time and again and then selecting random answers just to pass	1
the course needs a reboot some parts were merged with other and the whole thing lacks continuity a few examples were poorly chosen for instance signals  reactive concepts would be easier to understand in user interfaces or graphics  games	2
not the worst but i did not think this was a well developed course it felt like an informal conversation between the instructors with one of them repeatedly calling different aspects of swift cool it was very distracting i also thought the tests were vaguely worded and the final assignment was long and definitely more than the  minutes it said it would take to complete it i am all for difficult challenges but it felt like the final project was badly designeddescribed unenrolling	1
this is a short and valuable course i am grateful to have the opportunity to learn about improving my personal brand thank youl	4
very nice and interestingi learnt a lot i wish i could make better use of discussion forums some questions and few concepts remained unanswered not clear however it was a fantastic experience overall	3
this was the paper i was most looking forward to in the interaction design specialisation unfortunately it seems as if they ran out of time to design it properly despite extending its start date several times i didnt learn what i wouldve expected and all of the assignments blurred into one another	1
id learned more since i check harvard health blog so often	1
excellent course profesor javier estrada is one of the best very useful and  recommended	4
gave us many skills to save our time	2
please provide the certification is free i am coming from developing country so we are not able to pay this much amountplease make it free	3
followed instructions to download twice waste of time both times still kept getting an error never got past this to continue with the course so didnt learn anything other than there is little support out there to resolve the problem i think because the course is not monitored or if it is well then more fool me it would have been a good opportunity to explore this had it been possible to download unity oh well those who can do those who cant resume their day to day life packing boxes	0
inappropriate rating was done for me	2
interesting and enjoyable but i was looking for more of a rigorous introduction to plato the professor goes to a great deal of effort to make what otherwise might be a dry material engaging but i sometimes felt like i was watching one of those science programs for children where they sell how great science with fun graphics	2
you will have to make a scratch account free for this courseareti is a very clear instructor that explained concepts very well for complete beginners into programming like myself and i found the course insightful presentation  i couldnt help but wonder whether they had a lower target age teenagers or younger in mind which was entertaining at some points but also distracting at other times  also i only realized halfway through the course that it is in fact possible to see what areti is doing on the scratch program once the quality of the video is adjusted projectstime commitment  going through the lectures and quizzes are not time consuming at all but the projects especially the final project takes a lot of time it took longer than expected because i felt like much of the practical instructions on how to use scratch for specific purposes were not provided during the course leaving me to work by myself discussion forum  when i took the course the discussion forum was close to being dead especially compared to some of the other courses that i was taking simultaneously on coursera gerry mentor did an amazing job responding to my inquiry but i noticed that although there were a lot of students talking at the beginning introducing themselves there werent that many discussions concerning the final assignment making me feel like i was working alone it would be great if there was more time to work on the final project and perhaps a way in which students can collaborate and help out others when faced with a bug ie preliminary project submission and feedback sessioni recommend taking this course but realistically you wont be program proficient after  weeks you will however learn some basic programming theory understand how programming works and learn how to make a fun interactive game on scratch	3
the instructor is very dry and the mat	2
i would like more tasks to help learn its also really really easy to guess your way to the right answer a _lot_ of concepts words and specific tools are introduced with not much opportunity to actually use them meaningfully and feel that one has actually learned a skill as opposed to temporarily remembered the concepts for the quiz was nice not to have to watch videos though and the slides are good	1
brilliant thank you	4
far from being a real course it need polishing at this point it looks more like a basic tutorial with a few error perhaps next versions will be better	0
it is very much useful to the beginners who are thinking about their career in the software fieldsbecause this course is very much helpful to get an internships	3
this class the fourth in the specialization required a different version of unity d in order to complete compared to the first course in the specialization using a borrowed laptop i was not permitted to upgrade to a new version by laptop owner signing up for the course specialization and paying in advance was a ripoff since the software requirements changed in between course  and  coursera gives no refunds for a course specialization if you have completed the first course	0
the grading system i dont like it i coded and validated yet it returned error to me i was frustrated that i had to opt out of the course	0
its ok worth your time if you are trying to get into philosophy and want part of the proper foundation overall i enjoyed it and it was good as a handhold through the presocratics and some of the most essential platonic writingspros the videos are pretty easy to understand and the material chosencovered is good to knowcons the video quiz questions are reallydulland there are too many a downside of the ease of the videoslectures is that they dont really go that in depth and theyre nowhere near the quality ive seen in other coursera courses like the kierkegaard course from ucopenhagen	2
you can grasp the beauty of life and the world around only by getting deep knowledge in astronomy the course is great english pronunciation of the teacher is nice tests are good looking for peer assessments in the future sessions	4
good tips for testing experiments	3
easy to understand	4
great course and my first experience with an mooc i learned a lot and am already brainstorming ways to apply it	3
it is just not a good course for a beginner especially the assignment  is hard to understand and hope this course can add a little bit material on statistical programming or machine learning session in the future	1
not as detailed as i would have liked however i did indeed learn a few things in this case it may have been because im a professional developer just not a web developer i sort of wanted more but perhaps its inappropriate for me to ask nevertheless i do feel the course was rather week overall	1
good context simply quick efficient very pleasant to watch	3
too pricy	3
this course was a very disappointing experience since it is designed around depending on peer reviewed assignments that dont get graded i have been waiting for over  months for the st assignment to get regradedin the future i suggest the creators of this course stay away from peer graded assignment as it puts students in a position where their grade depends on others and not the knowledge the student acquires from the course content	1
a good introduction to the arduino platform looking forward to attending the next course	3
excellent course one of the best i have ever attended 	4
mr campbells presentations are quite boring and consist of a handful of phrases repeated over and over again the subjects are treated very superficially and the presentation style is confusing i recommend to other students to read the wikipedia articles about the subjects instead several times it feels like mr campbell has never before seen the slides he is reading from and he is simply inventing stuff some information presented is plain wrong also there is repeated talk of practical exercises to come but that never happens to mr campbells presentations i would only award one staron the other hand i really liked the presentations from mr farivar he obviously knows what he is talking about and presents the material in a clear and understandable way he should take over the whole course and let mr campbell do some research back in his office i would award  stars to mr farivarthe homeworks of this course are simply checking for a very basic understanding of the topics eg to do this and that would you use technology a b or c where the answer are some quite different technologiesthe course needs more involvement of the students by going more indepth and adding some practical exerciseshad the cloud computing specialization started with this course i would probably have aborted it	1
if youre new and an aspirant to the big data field this course is for you	4
dr fowler is passionate engaging and a great teacher i highly recommend the course	4
interesting course format quizes in videos programming homeworks graded via provided unit testing mechanism and the fact that prof ng explains complicated stuff clearly and really well makes this course one of the best courses ive seen so far it is a pleasure to learn things this way 	4
a brilliant catch up on all things digital  thank you	4
handson instructions and a very practical knowledge thanks	0
very insightful highly recommended for anyone who is new to hotel revenue management a good foundation course for hotel marketing and distribution	3
good for starters instructor is very good	3
enjoyable content and presentation but the coarse seemed very short compared to others ive taken not a criticism but rather and observation if it was short on purpose that is one thing but i believe there is more to be said on this topic fundamentally and hope to see this course expanded or a second one producedi would like to that those involved int its creation	3
good introduction to c and a nice gentle introduction to the xnamonogame framework its lots of hard work for beginners for but seasoned c programmers might be better off just learning monogame on their own	3
this course is very important for my expirience and my job	3
too dull no programming explanations sometimes too simple and suddenly too technical	0
informative but not challenging enough	1
you need basic understanding of excel to follow the course the formulas are interesting and	2
mr roth is woefully unprepared for this course his assessments of the several artists and thinkers he explores are deeply and distressingly flawed  and why would he repeat in a classroom with unbecoming histrionics the same lesson hes just delivered from his office	0
great introduction to philosophy i think the last couple of weeks couldve been done a bit better as theyre quite niche forms of philosophy but other than that its great	3
my only regret is that it doesnt use python but it is a course to attend 	4
very interesting course well explained good assesments i learned a lot	4
i would have rated the course higher if there were a way to practice writing the documents discussed in the lectures great introduction to business writing though very accessible to nonbusiness persons	3
interesting topic but teaching is not so attractive	2
lots of unnecessary information included in each video which make them long and boring number and length of videos in each week are too much while the practical information you get are not enough	1
too theoretical eg comparison between statistics and ml is not at all useful too many quizzes after very short classes and on topics of absolutely generic things	1
i supposed that may be i am not very clever so the content and the question after the class also make me confused a little bit disapoint with this course but i saw a lot people below think this a good course so may be i am wrong	2
expected more based on the arduino course very lite on material	2
love it	3
uses and ancient version of python	0
a good introduction with very good videos and exercises im only not giving  stars due to the relative lack of clarity in the final week and the lack of feedback on the final exam	3
real live scenarios of running a project would add a great deal to the course	2
got better as i went along the first few weeks were a little rough	2
i learned some new information in this course and was reminded of some healthy eating habits i had forgotten i love that she cooks meals cooking show style the class about how to stock your pantry for healthy eating was particularly helpful	3
wonderful course 	3
dr chuck rocks 	4
very basic	1
i thought you would learn how to actually create a website not just how to pick and install a premade wordpress theme	0
strategic implementation something that people generally forget about after creating their marvellous strategies and then watch them fail this course teaches us how not to make that mistakethe course was nicely organised though i believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking rating on a  scale for about  questions clearly showed central tendency problems as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews i hope it can be improved in the future	2
so i went into this not so sure about it but its actually a fun little course the instructor is actually really entertaining and makes what could be a very dry and boring topic interesting to hear about	4
instructor speaks very fast so that i read subtitles instead of hearing what he say in addition to i stop video more times to understand what he say but totally the scientific and technical contents are great also his advises for us in which how we can find the answers for our questions about data science	2
sometimes too easy but may be good as a start point video lessons are long for the amount of the shared information	2
not very much information and lesson to learn deep	1
really helpful for a good start with raspberry pi thanks a lot	4
this course should be revised the material was lacking just static images no real time coding overall engagement for the courses was also lacking the instructor sounded low quality and sometimes a bit hard to understand i could no complete this course unfortunately	1
very general and knowledge you could easily acquire from the web the only difference is the presentation of the information is stretched over an hour worth of video the most useful part of this course however is the walkthrough examples provided	0
they push the university of maryland way too much the book and the videos have much of the same content the book that you buy is written by the professor who runs the course which i do not agree with the book could be more direct in how it gives you the lessons	0
i dont know how the peer reviews are done and like everyone else says its hard to trust them however it was a nice course i certainly learnt something that would really help my job	2
the course content is very poorly explained the quiz questions dont really test what was taught in the lectures and the assignments are just copying and pasting things i feel like i still have a very poor understanding of what was supposedly covered in the course i cannot generalise or apply the learned information or skills to other topics or researches because i didnt actually understand the core concepts or how to use the programs	0
too fundamental too easy no depth in math	2
i loved the manner in which the course contents were delivered the course teacher know the art of articulation he knows how to teach complex ideas in a simple manner without loosing its essence of the argument i was so immersed in his lecture one full night i watched his lecture and finished  course material i wish i could deliver a lecture like it a big salute to an inspiring teacher	3
nice teachers	3
the professor michael scharf seems to have a heavy bias to justice as in punishment and that leaves me with a poor taste as i listen to his content i found an error in content that bothered me but did not interfere with the main points of the course overall im happy with the understanding of international criminal law that i have gained though i am displeased with the biases i found in the professor	2
barely any depth	1
some given assets need to be upgrades or provided for the latest version of unity otherwise a great class well worth the time and effort	3
expected a lot more from the course also the teaching style isnt very engaging either	1
good starting course information well presented	3
interesting course and specialization a few inaccuracies need to be corrected so it can be properly pursued at its best	2
the course is great however we have to pay to get all tasks or a certificated	1
the course was informative	3
good course for those with limited exposure to business metrics would be more valuable to include  or  standard key performance indicators kpis by function marketing sales operations finance etc that will be typically encountered in an advanced undergraduate or mba program	2
i found this course to be very interesting i took this course simultaneously with the one from ucsd on the holocaust so they enhanced each other i especially appreciated having a lecture in which anita shapira participated  i had already read israel a history so it added an extra dimension to that a couple of small niggles  a i think a warning for those that dont speak hebrew that they need to use the subtitles facilitysomething ive never used before b i think some of the english spellings may be ambiguous when translating from hebrew because of the special use of vowelsall in all i enjoyed this and hope you provide more courses relating to the israelipalestinian situation many ordinary people are very uninformed and vulnerable to misleading propaganda courses like this are vital in informing nonjews	3
this course did an excellent job of introducing the basic concepts of machine learning	4
excellent courst but you have to pay in order to access the quizes and assignments very dissapointing	2
great course i hoped it would have gone into a bit more detail but it was good to get a tour through the history of computer networks	3
unable to start the course the page reloads again and again in an endless loop	0
i posted questions and couldnt find any answer the course also doesnt allow me to be creative although its about design in answering assignments	0
not very engaging information overflow and poorly delivered lectures where the instructor is just reading from slides i dont recommend paying for this it is better to just check out the syllabus and read about this stuff onlinenote to instructor very simple concepts were explained using overly complicated language also please refrain from over using the word essentially	0
i have a hard time focusing on what he is trying to say he seems all over the place and doesnt seem to follow a path that i can understand im sure live its different but when youre taking it online and parts are	0
some matters were just given formulas and there was a lack of practice the course should cover less materials or be longer to be effective in teaching	1
this is an excellent course the lectures are clear and very wellprepared the course material is excellent and yaakov is an excellent presenter very informative and engaging highly recommended	4
this is terrible	0
the videos are very dry and not entirely helpful the labs are well laid out	2
i took up to week  and so far this course assumes statistics knowledge i expected it would provide a background on the rather than just run a code and show the results	0
great if you literally know nothing about writing but want to write otherwise the first three modules cover basic story writing information whats great is the interviews with authors and the ability to peer review and so read all sorts of things	3
good teaching easy task	4
this course is of lower quality than the preceding courses the final assignment instructions are not clear the forums helped but i have the impression that they are not really followed by the mentors	2
a reasonable walkthrough of typical tools for photo editing only thing id like to add is a walkthrough of a simple typical photo editing workflow like cropping wb coarse tone adjustment tone curve sharpening  consumption format rendering	3
i feel a lot more confidence in what i am learning although some of the assignments have been a little confusing it has pushed me to look for external sources to validate and seek material to complete work pushing me to use creativity	3
thank you once again courser and team for their generous contribution towards students across globe the teachers and courses mentors specially sophie who was awesome during the assignment for her nice clarification this course was challenging but fun	4
overall i feel the course provided sufficient material to understand the concepts and terminology for some of the data analysis terms i feel that practice problems and step by step guides should be provided	3
amy falink is a really great lecturerthank you	4
there is a choice in assignments you can do them either written or video however the evaluation highly favors videos and it is not possible to pass te course without doing them course staff do not respond to this issue not very motivating	1
this might be just a personal opinion the tips given in this course are rather intuitive i happen to use the techniques explained in the course because they simply seem logic still for unorganized people it will be useful and is clearly and well presented	2
after the first week the instructors never showed up to answer a single question in the forums the capstone project itself was disappointing i learned much more from doing my own app in class i took the coursera android specialization which was eons better than this i would not recommend this ios specialization to anyone i would never again take a mooc from u of toronto	0
doesnt look quite helpful just some common things	1
excellent course great overview for those who are new to thinking about negotiations from a business point of view	4
this is the worst most pathetic course i have taken online if peking university believes this is their best  ill not be taking another course with them the instructors command of the english language is awful and the subtitles are some help but not a lot instructors are just talking faces up front  they cannot teach they may be great in the lab but keep them out of the classroom i toughed out the course but it only got worse i had originally signed up for parts  and  of this course canceled part  the use of slides that are not clear  too small and not on the screen long enough to digest the information did not help do yourself a favor  avoid this course as a side note  i have taken in excess of  online courses this was the most painful	0
very good and useful course	4
great introduction highly recommended	4
good content but man i am struggling with the verbose pedantic style its like you are teaching college stuff to th graders if you say someone values something at  you dont have to say  that means he will let it go if offered  and will not let it go if offered only  thats a waste of my time and yours	1
most part of this course is a duplicate of the r programming coursemicrophonesound of the teacher quality is very badnot original boring dividing this in  weeks is too ridiculously long this should be done in  week to enable users to take more time for the r programmingthis course should be free dont lose too much time on it its doable in a day or a weekend and move on to r programmingasking for so much money to see how to install r and github is a shamefeels like this course has been added just to have a round number for the specializationeven the survey in the end asking for feedback starts with a question not adapted to moment its been asked did you get a certificate of course i did not as ive just finish the course and now wait for my peers to review my final submission	0
great material so far	4
this is a very bad course	0
this is a complete waste of time the other courses were really good but with this course ilearned nothing newunlearned best practises from the previous coursesmick doesnt seem to understand what he is presenting himself at times the supplied code does not match the videos the assignments change when i already submitted it from upload a zip to deploy and the assignments are copy pasted i think it would help to take this part out of the specialisation	0
the course is so simple and just has only a few interesting points	1
the obstacle of not knowing french is quite detrimental	0
the lecturer and his avatar are funny the course content is structured but the delivery is a bit loose	2
the course is not very useful due to its lacking of practical examples and assignments	0
the teacher is not a communicator	2
so far its been very interesting course	4
the broad fundamental basics that everyone should know the course was effective in convening the must knowhows and how to adequately implement them i was expecting the course to be slightly more challenging however i already have legal know how so apart from that its a worth while investment in ones life that can be applied in and for any organisation	3
very good course easy to attend and informative i learned new things in a pleasant way	3
great course	4
 hour waiting period after  tries is a pain in the arse one more try and i would have had it	1
lots of theoretical information but very little practical information about what to do with people with autism spectrum disorder	1
important material poorly taught	0
excellent lectures let down by the difficulty of the assignmentswhile the tutors clearly know their stuff i found the assignments really quite challenging and of limited educational value due to the mixture of new concepts introduced by the lectures along with new to me mathematics or cs that also needed to be graspedim an experienced professional programmer with the epfl fp in scala and frp courses under my belt so i thought i knew what to expect but this was much more time consuming than id thought	1
the modules had a lot of aspects and covered each one in detail however it would have been helpful to have some handson exercises like writing an executive summary evaluating a resume writing an elevator pitch etc so that people learn from each other otherwise its a great course with emphasis on different aspects of business writing thanks	2
very confusing lectures he says you dont have to have a basic level of excel to do the course but i didnt find that true struggled through all of the lecture videos and the quizzes seemed to come out of left field	0
i love this course very helpful	4
introduction to philosophy is very insightful the fundamentals of philosophy is explained in a way which is so easy to understand very good program	3
i thought this course would be more fun and interesting but i find it very repetitive with the fundamentals of graphic design if you buy the package it kind of seems like i wasted  dollars on a repetitive and monotone professor and course i would not recommend this course within the specialization	0
if youve not read a single book on writing this class might be good otherwise dont expect to get much about the  minutes of lecture	2
very good but brief course	3
the material was self explanatory and easy to understand references where provided and this helped me gain a wider knowledge of the course	4
i was denied completion of this course because a fellow course taker felt the need to grade unfairly i suggest all peers keep in mind we are here to learn not to be judge so critically the spirit of the course was destroyed by a thoughtless action if you wish to be critical thats fine but at least have the courage to leave feedback for me to review coward	0
the course hasnt started yet but the ideas that the professors gave me in the lectures were amazing i am eager to see the videos that come next i hope it helps me in unlocking my potential	3
good course but weird final evaluation check	3
a nice introductory course on greening the economy i wish it would go a bit deeper in some issuesthe difficulty level was for me just too easy maybe i was not the target group after all since i have previous knowledge in the subjectnevertheless for someone who is new to the subject this is a very well strucutred and easy to follow course	3
i would like to give this course worse than a  star the course explanations are very poor the explanations drag on and make no sense i had to go to outside sources to make sense of what the videos were discussing which i felt like defeats the purpose why am i paying for something when i have to use other sources to better explain i would never recommend this course to anyone listening to these teachers explain each subject poorly was killing me i like to learn through examples but what they provide just makes it more confusing and hard to follow each instructor got worse and worse the videos were so hard to watch and the accents made it even more worse i feel robbed from taking this course i should have asked for my refund within the first week but i felt since i was paying i would stick it out a little longer you will get a better explanation if you take each subject and youtube the videos on each subject very useless course hated every week of this course and i wouldnt dare to continue with the full specialization program its very sad to hear that this course gets recommended a lot but it missed its mark completely	0
had potential but exercises and quizzes do not align with content taught by professor this is not a beginners course	1
very good course and professors	4
to lock assignments for money is disgusting	0
teaching style of teachers is very dry and boring	1
nicely organized clear explanations	4
fantastic mooc helped me alot on recovering my focus and zombiesthe most helpful tool im using is the pomodoro technique described in the coursethe daily task list is also a very useful way of setting objectives everyday	4
good introductory course however an overkill as a separate course and hence charging  for it courses  and  could have been clubbed together	0
it was very good and basic course it would be great if its next part can also describe these technologies in detail and with handson experience	3
this course is not terrible i learned a few things but it is poorly designedsome things are explained as if to people who arent familiar with the concepts at all while others are explained as if to people who must already know a lot about the concepts i often felt lost the quizzes did not help you could do well on them without actually understanding things i remember one multiplechoice question where the options were something like a arrheniuss first law b arrheniuss second law c arrheniuss third law and you didnt even have to look at the question or know what the law was to know the answer because only one of arrheniuss laws had been mentioned in the course at allthere are two types of videos in this course in one type the professor is in a lab or kitchen or classroom or something and is physically demonstrating things these videos are useful and mostly understandable the other type of videos are lecturestyle things that appear to have literally been sliced out of some other more thorough set of videos  sometimes the professor refers back to earlier parts of the lecture that we havent actually seen before concepts and variables are often introduced without even mentioning what they refer to	1
no or least supportcourse quality is great but problems with grader will left you with wasting your expensive timeassignments are good but intend to go wayyy more beyond the scope and to learn from online materials though other sitesgrading system is not easy you have the right answer but youll need to waist hours to produce specific string for your grader to be satisfiedthis i not an elegant learning process at all	1
very poor lecture support for the assignments so much was not covered at all during the lectures that the assignments were extremely time consuming	1
a lot of outdated information a lot of mistakes but still a good way to understand the basics	2
the course is very interesting and detailed but maybe too technical in some partsalso some not too sporadic errors and missing pieces of information in the questions made quizzes even harder to pass the discussions on the forum were of great help in this sense though	3
its great to understand more of research methods in application but i wish there were more resources provided to supplement our study in general this is a good course for those who start thinking of doing research in the future	2
homework assesments can be improved ive seen that in sam assignments even if the answer is correct grading sytem was not able to understand it	3
i cant say i really enjoyed this  week course the flow itself was more like food for thought where a bunch of ideas are presented as sort of an intellectual gymnastics exercise with no point really by week  you are just plain bored the content wasnt concise enough it could have easily been a  week course or even shorter had they not tried to belabor each topic it all was too high level and never really got down enough to earth i have done other courses on the same topic which were better put together	1
the course itself has been really useful although im not sure it has taught me much that is truly new what it has done though is to fill in gaps and to give me a big helping hand into understanding how to tackle what to write about beforehand i suffered somewhat from blank canvas syndrome but this course has given me ideas to get past that the coursera site and app could still do with some work since collaboration with other students is not as easy as it could	3
really fantastic even as an experienced r user this is helping me remould my habits and break some of the bad ones thank you so much	4
wonderful introduction excellent	4
this course is addressing a critical subject matter the material is great i love the mathbut these are my personal metrics a star course has a high level of student collaboration and teaching staff participation a star course has very responsive teaching staff i love learning the material but the learning environment is disappointingas the course progresses to the later weeks the inconsistency between quizzes and lectures grows not greatly but enough to frustrate some quiz questions with multiple choice options with only one correct answer will not accept any answer there are a few questions which are not covered in the video lecture or covered in later weeks some answers can be found in the book but the book supposedly is not required some answers can be googled but the answers vary wildly between sourcesmathematical thinking from stanford is the gold standard	2
could be more computer friendly had good information but hard to engage because the majority of the lectures are just powerpoints with the professor talking over them	2
it was extremely helpful for me	4
joe warren ur better than this	0
loved this course it gave me a great introduction to current concepts and trends in digital marketing i was especially impressed by d printers i hope to visit a hub in my own city soon to try it outonly suggestion is reduce the number of weekly workload too many assignments to complete in a single week most courses in coursera give only one assignment per week i was able to manage as this was a selfpaced course so this is not a complaint just a suggestion 	3
teacher is fanta	4
unprecedented high speaking speed	0
very basic stuff	2
very clear introduction for those unfamiliar with r rstudio git github and the basics of statistical analysis	3
love chuck	4
i have some background in programming not advanced so some of this was review but it is a great introduction to the world of programming for anybodyas long as you have the interest this is the place to start	4
i am dropping this course as it is too elementary i had hoped for something at a more advanced university level	0
this is strictly for beginners if you have had little hands on experience in python you may not find it that useful though its good to rehearse a bit also this course was on python  so try to identify the differences between  and  one concern is that python installation steps are covered in every weeks classes which is redundant one	2
this is too high level for a machine learning course you dont exactly learn a lot about the techniques just how to use them and name them out if youre having a conversation with a person my least favorite course in the series	1
i really enjoyed the coursei learned a lot of things about specific pieces of modern art with some of which i was familiar to and with others i wasntthe only thing i would say this course lacks is the fact that there are not enough assignments to work on and so we can not use our imagination and knowledge to write something inspiring	3
thanks a lot dr chuck	4
very effective for beginners	4
a very interesting course	3
all that i needed	4
this course is very important	3
it is like for kids i think all courses must mention their target audience contents videos talks nothing was value for time	0
wonderful informative and interesting course	4
it would be more useful if the instructors put forward more resources to practise the programming learnt	3
wonderful course its having a great learning value	4
great course and nice assignmentsthe course was particularly very helpful in teaching me the new tags of html	4
the course is really basic but the instructor is good i liked the idea to submit the exercises and count on other students to review it however its a little bit annoying the exercises	2
its a very good courseits a pity that we need to pay to be able to submit assignments	3
interesting course on the business side of social media marketing	3
there was little of actual teaching going on in this course the pace was too rushed for beginners and peerreviewing was managed so poorly it was unhelpful	0
super costly the course needs to make at least some of the quizes available for the free users	2
many points are just a presentation of bulletins with a very brief description could use a little more depth or at least some pointers for further study	2
the mooc was good and full of hidden treasures unfortunatelly last week had a very low quality  it was the only part i wasnt able to take out anything week  on the other hand was full of interesting techniques prsented in weekly homework and surely worth further investigation to sum up im glad i finished it but i suggest to rearrange its form  add some videoes and remove other onesall the bestpiotr milewski	2
could have more exercises for the ones who still is saving up to pay for it	3
the module was alright but i got bored halfway through	2
very dissapointing to not be able to make the quizzes and the assigments without paying it	0
the information is not presented well and the math is not always taught	0
good for learning the basics includes some neat interviews with people who created the internet	3
i think itd be good to have more practice excercises besides the lectures	3
the course is too complicated also this programm isnt working as good as it should i got so many failures which i had to look for by myself also it isnt well explained i almost didnt understand anything also some data persons i knew didnt understand that either they never worked with something like that	0
first of all thank you very much for providing this ive learned a lotwhy not  starsin some cases you just used a link to wikipedia as additional material for a video in the first and second week you had more details i know you already kindly invested a lot of time but i would appreciate if you could add some details to those sections where you just used links	3
i liked the course i give  stars because as i noticed some of the course content wasnt updated even if almost one year ago people issued that some calculations given by professor are wrong	3
relevant and well organized material when looking at it but in total it is way too thin more tips and tricks about xcode as a tool would have been nice some of the videos are pretty unrehearsed one of the lecturers hesitates and stutters a lotas for the final assignment being reviewed by only three persons is too few one of my reviewers had problems with his xcode environment and couldnt run my submission guess how he graded me the other reviewers had no problems luckilythere is almost no help to be found in the discussion forums which seems pretty buggy there are no tas and the staff doesnt seem to be very active eitherim sure the course will improve in the future its at the time of writing the only swiftxcodeios mooc on coursera	2
this a very interesting and wellorganized course	4
it was nice considering the messages and the amount of time however participation and feedback by others was really limited	2
the assignments had nothing to do with the lectures the teachers do a poor job of explaining basic concepts and theories the class is a lot more advanced than the class description makes it seem	0
no teaching just a guy talking do the problem sets for practice if you need help pause the videos and try the code out yourselfseriously though a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it he doesnt work through code but talks around the concepts	0
the content was very shallow not lot of hands on	1
a must do course for everyone 	3
about two years ago i completed dr mines course data analysis and statistical inference and was quite impressed by it i always hoped that thered be a follow up on bayesian statistics so i was really excited when i heard that a course on this topic had finally been created however while attending the course i became more and more disappointed dr mine does a nice job explaining things other teachers in this course arent as talented most slides  videos are quite useless for teaching because they skip over important steps without giving appropriate explanations also i was quite disappointed that this course pretty much only focuses on conjugate priors mcmc is only skimmed over and the introduction to mcmc is more than questionable  instead of showing a simple example mcmc is squeezed into the topic of bayesian model selection another point is r  this course doesnt really teach bayesian stats with r it teaches how to call oneliners like bayes_inference from package statsr or baslm from package bas instead of lm this is totally disappointing i wish this course would skim over conjugate prior methods and then focus on mcmc sampling methods by teaching how to build interesting and practically useful models using jagsstanpymcwhatever for anyone interested in bayesian stats id recommend reading doing bayesian data analysis  using r jags and stan and probabilistic programming and bayesian methods for hackers these books are actually cheaper than this course	0
excellent this course taught me a lot	4
helpful and cleari would like it more if it had more elaboration and practice on the presented toolsthanks	2
it was informative course assignments could be more involved and exercises could be more openended	4
it tries to cover a lot of ground lack of some practical tasks	1
asked for more feedback for peers that found my final paper insufficient received nothing asked for guidance from staff received nothing excellent course with great content but i have issues with the evaluation process when peers and staff do not participate in the advertised methods of communicating their concerns with my work	1
this course was required by my director but it is not for those who have no background in law which was the case for the group of us at cdc who were required to take this it was very difficult to iuinderstand and i did not think it was a beginners course for no	0
the course is a great introduction i just wished that we could have designated people evaluating our submissions instead of exclusively peer to peer	3
i gained a lot from this course but perhaps not as much as expected even considering it is a fundamentals course i had hoped to learn a bit more depth rather than the few basic concepts actually covered that being said the instructor did mention at the very beginning which aspects would be skipped and which would be covered and those covered were covered very well with the possible caveat that the instructor tended to teach as standard methods that were her preference or background additional research on my own turned up a wider variety of pm techniques that were not even mentionedoverall worth taking especially as a very basic introduction for those who like me had no previous pm experience	2
perfect guided course the only handicap to me is the accent of the speaking english i hardly understand what they are saying without subtitlesthx for your all precious effort	0
iot more examples should have been covered and also assignments for iot would have been better	3
this course covers a good amount of bayesian statistics however the presentationvideos starting from week  really sucks they change instructors for difference topics and obviously some instructors are not very good at explaining other than reading the materialthe videos skipped many medium steps that are actually very crucial for understanding the concepts and no suggested reading materials at all either also the quiz are not very well designed either for example some quiz are much more simpler than the course material which makes it not helpful at all to understand the course material itself while some times it is the oppositethe first three courses in this specialization are very good but somehow this course are way below the quality of the previous ones	1
great theme for a course perfect idea but i had some issues with execution of it so these are the issues	2
really does help me learn python	4
this course was a big letdown compared to other courses in the specialization it doesnt seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation much of the content is unclear and there is little depth course textbook and some swirl exercises would have helped	0
very good teachersinstructors	4
my respective teacher has given us a task to complete this courseas a sessional activity astonishingly when i heard the title of the course materials science  things every engineer should knowtheir is not a single thing that come into my mind that what could probably the thing that we dont knowafter completing the coursesuprisinglyi find that actually i know about the  thingseventually i realize that i am not certain about the facts or building blocks about material science that this things is the main stream of it appreciatively it is a remarkable knowledge that i have come to know about material science	3
this class is practical and it can be the first class in ml	3
great and highly informative	4
great course it addresses a number of topics on ml and takes you to the point in which you can start working on ml on your owni missed a clear path of what are the roadmap for the course why each topic is presented when and why is important its easy to get lost until you follow the reasoning of the instructor	3
thanks for this course	4
i took the first class in this specialization i liked that enough to enroll in the second class however i did not realize that it was being taught by the same teacher nothing against her she certainly taught the class and met the objectives she just speaks too slowarticulates too precisely for me also i was not aware that coursera changed the auditing policy as an auditor i am no longer able to participate in the assignments or quizzes in this class without the ability to do the assignments and receive peer feedback it seems pointless to continue the class furthermore there was a problem with the practice exercises you need to download an app to do the practice which i did several times but the lessons or assignments never worked i sent notes to coursera about this with no reply the low rating is primarily based on the fact that i could not do the practice assignments and that coursera took away the ability to complete assignments and take quizes	1
this course strayed too far from its origins yes this course contains topics that are nicetoknow but they are by no means essential or useful	1
good lecture and content however disappointing that even when i audit the course i cannot take the exams this is contrary to most of the other coursera courses where you can if you cannot afford to participate you have limited access to the testing material im not impressed	1
this course is wonderful and i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it but it is not well monitored the peer review process is broken and questions are not answered making it frustrating for example i wrote an essay and received a nonpassing grade i rewrote it and submitted it the comments back were very good but the grade remained a nonpassing one very difficult to figure it out i posted a request for clarification and received no response so course great administration of course not so much	2
crisply covered critical aspects of data analysis	4
i got the feeling that we ran through the material and did not spend ample time setting up the testing and understanding the environment maybe the course need to be two weeks to cover this properly	2
content is great and direct to the point but  disappointing factors could have been avoided to make this course perfect sound is almost in one ear which can make you feel dizzy if you are using headset instructor is reading everything like a robot very fast  no passion or whatsoeveri guess  stars is fair enough	2
this is a very good course but probably more sql will make it even better	3
good work	2
basic but well done	2
i was disappointed by this course maybe because i had a great expectations for it months of delay and poor content	1
it is excellent course i recommended to participate at the next session	3
some interesting concepts but way to simplistic in my opinion only reason i see to pay for it is the fact that it is a requirement in the data science specialization	0
this course is good but i feel its too difficult it would be good to suggest optional prerequisite course if there is any thanks dr egger	2
a very informative introductory course providing basic knowledge and overview of practices in the music business particularly useful for artists who want to be educated on the financial and legal aspects in managing music career	3
really intresting i learnt a lot and now i have the opportunity to understand more things about recruiting hiring and onboarding  thank you very much	3
amazing course about legged robot	4
im sorry but the presentations were very poor and unpreparedthe first quiz focused on rather unimportant and stuff which was not presented in videos like keyboard shortcuts etcdo not recommend	0
neither statistics nor r was covered in any meaningful way at the end of the course you are left with frustration for having to jump through the loops but no understanding of the principles i am a college instructor for statistics having graduated from a phd program  even with that background i could not follow the instructorthe course designer never considered the audience and never identified the goals of this course the instructor was lost between teaching r and teaching stats so in the end he did neither worst course i have ever taken both online and facetoface	0
on the positive side the content was very interestingon the negative side the course was not particularly well structured the last week was quite difficult to follow	2
the title is misleading this course has a little to do with excel  you could get some mathematical information but i do not think you will master anything	1
to be an introduction it is a good course	3
classes moved very fast especially in the video materials functions were introduced briefly without time to digest while i ultimately did learn the topics through my own research i feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower more indepth explanations	2
a nice course to learn the basics of python and raspberry pi programming	3
i wouldnt give a star for this course materials are prosaic wordy professors have not designed a truly hightech course with automated grading they want peers to grade each other  i dont like this euphemism which is equivalent to the blind leading the blind i do not want to spend my energy correcting other peoples programming assignments i want to spend the time thinking about programming and working on my own programs  the concept of collaboration is false  everyone wants to develop their own stuff not share with others so the premise of the course is inaccurate also the course has many longwinded texts of little use to the student this is a course more about indoctrination in a legacy system than it is a course to liberate the mind through computers while the content is interesting i am completely turned off by the amount of time i have to devote to commenting on other peoples stuff  i am not a teacher  that is the teachers job not my job  also i do not like the condescension and clownishness of the profs in this course  i do not need to be entertained and all the talk about monty python one of the corniest programs on tv trivializes the material  a nononsense mit type course is preferable  this is a course that i would avoid from the logistical perspective although i will follow the material side of the course because it has substantial content and that includes the specialization  hello teachers in the course  automate the grading and remove all of the peer evaluations and start offering authentic instruction not lazy instruction of students teaching students  the approach is typical of all legacyoriented courses  the same goes for the severance course at the university of michigan  if the rice course is supposed to instill interest in rice university this offering turns me away from rice because one realizes that rice is too legacyoriented in its approach same old same old	0
starting to like this	0
the quizzes are written in a very tricky way its supposed to be a course for beginners	1
amazing course i cant even describe it amazing professor i wish you are my teacher till the end of time	4
tableau is garbage and their assignment practice questions dont work	0
if the week  was not there i would have a  or even a  for this classuntil week  there was very little connection between what we were watching and what we were asked to write assignments and the assignments were also confusing and overly restrictive there didnt seem to be any sense in why we were asked to write those	2
very high level	2
this is a very good python pandas course thats part of a data science specialization that i wish existed  years ago when i first started using pandas as much as i like wes mckinneys book python for data analysis having an elearning format mixing video lectures and handson assignments is a definite plusive decided to take this class out of curiosity and in order to get ideas about a class im about to teach and even if i consider myself as an experienced pandas user top on stackoverflow for pandas i think its pretty involved if youre new to pandas and covers pretty much every key concept of pandas you should must be aware of the assignments can certainly look very challenging to the newcomer and they do a great job of looking like an actual project messy data multiple sources etci dearly recommend  and i have already started to personally recommend it  this course for anyone whos interested in learning more about data wrangling in pandasthanks for putting this together	4
very basic for the cost it represents it doesnt really provide information beyond what one could find on a simple review on the first page of google	0
i think that is a poor course a lot of much theory and little practice is better read a book and see youtube it doesnt meet my expectations	0
the course provides fundamentals as advertised but the delivery was not impressive for example the lecturers speech interrupts changing words and thoughtflow examples given were not well thoughtout for example hr was said to be hardset because it was outsourced which doesnt make sense another example would be where the lecturer said that standup meetings mean no body is allowed to sit down generally seems to me the course was filmed in a hurry and wasnt delivered good enough for a rating above the basic fundamental two stars	1
another great course nd best after managing an agile team great content and presenters with useful recommendations	3
nice structure although needed more assignments outside just the quizzes to get you to use the skills	2
it was an excellent course	4
very weak presentation must be improved to keep attention	0
do not take this course unless you have previous c coding experience it is most definitely not for beginners	0
very slow paced and boring the instructor is not good at teaching	0
outdated	0
the course is excellent but there is mistakes in quiz and the forum participation is null professor nor your staff reply the forums	2
quite fastpaced indeed even the instructors seem like theyre in a rush it would have helped if there was a glossary of terms for people who arent wellversed in programming basicsbut in summary its an interesting course 	3
it was very enjoyable course thank you	3
the course content is good however by the review assigment i can see that the concepts were not clear ther	2
poorcourse crammed with unnecessary details loads of css decoration properties that one may test on its own without focusing on css fundamentals such as page layout strategies floatbased layouts element positioning which in my view are discussed only very superficiallyill forget  of discussed decoration properties in a few days but when i think of css paradigms  a structure that can be later filled with easily forgotteneasily retrieved decoration properties  that ill take with me for ever out from this course sounds empty the extra star goes for stressing the importance of accessibilityto sum up decoration largely outweighs structure	1
the course is built around people doingstudying business and economics i am a scientist but i still learned a lot from it the course is very practical	4
i indeed acquired a detailed set of structured knowledge from a very practical perspective this has given me a different perception and better approach to translate actions and activities around me especially in projectsspecial thanks to coursera	4
nice informative but basic and short	2
very limited teaching and contradictory assignments for those with english as a second language be aware this course uses grammatical terminology but in a stylistic way and can cause a lot of confusion assignments are weak but as a whole for the four courses making up the capstone just grit your teeth and get through it the least enjoyable and instructive of all four	1
one of the most boring courses i have ever takeni had to force myself to finish it the teacher is charismatic but the content is just theories and abstract ideasjust blah blah blah	0
its seemingly a great course for k teachers but lacks relevance for higher education	1
fantastic course a bit heavy on the statistics but very interesting to learn about a transition in food culture would be interesting to see a course abou other places can apply the findings to change their own good culture	4
good course and visionary	3
very few amount of exercise and very small gain of knowledge from capstone	1
its quite involved fast and not explained thoroughly in some places	2
excellent course to brush up your grammar and punctuation	3
overall satisfied with the course moreover at the end of every chapter there are extra videos about jquery json that was awesome i learned something new in this course	3
the course is not easy for someone who is new to programming languages i myself with  years of programming knowledge with other languages i found it difficult to understand the only thing i liked about this course was swirl training it was pretty easy fun and clearassignment was too hard and the descriptions are not that clear specially assignment 	1
though i dont have the resources for the certficate this is a great course to continue or start your interest in astronomy	4
good course and well presented by both	1
the course is not well constricted to guide students its only fill the gaps	1
i would like to rate this fabulous course as excellent under dr emma jakoi and dr jennifer carbrey brilliant instructersthank you very much for all the kind explanation given for my questions and good video quizzes enjoyable problem sets and mind provoking examsregards and lots of thanksindira raghunathan	4
could not get through the first week way too much emphasis on bluej and duke university specific libraries i i already have a decent foundation in coding and took the course with the idea i could get a refresher on java if your a beginner there are way better courses out there this course is all over the place and i could see it being confusing for someone just picking up programming	1
the instructor is very annoying and he talks way too much about non important stuff	0
i once had a boyfriend who said my mind was like an encyclopedia that had come free from its binding to some extent thats true and it makes me i think fun to drink with i think the prof of this course would be super fun to drink with too i can only imagine the directions the conversation would careen how many diversions and reversions and tangents we would go on in terms of instruction though i find it rather exhausting first were talking about ottoman reforms then a diversion into goethe or some other dour teutonic thinker then a tangent into but well cover that in another video so in  but if you read letranger ive taken to listening to the lectures while doing something else and then parsing the transcripts trying to tease out some sort of linear narrative for my notes and its just so effortful and timeconsuming	2
lessons are easy to understand and the course outline is certainly coherent 고맙습니다 강교수님	3
really enjoyed this course thank you x	3
its a good coursealthough it starts a little slowly and then really builds up a lot of steam towards the end i think it should be paced out to be an week course and include shorter less ambitious assignments i personally found that the assignments lead to onerous difficulty unless one actively seeks out different aspects of the language other than what was taught in this course particularly native list methods and once that has begun then the last two weeks of it seem like a longwinded slogits nice to be able to learn programming style from odersky himself i recommend the text functional programming in scala to read and work through during the course	3
thank you for offering this wonderful introductory course to understand korea and asia economy i hope there will be an advanced course after this course	3
staff are incredibly arrogant bordering on aggressive the very worst of the pontificating profession  and what we long term learners and educators know to be all too common i couldnt stand it so i stopped would never recommend	0
if possible i would give this course zero stars it provides an incredibly closed minded view towards all topics and provides very minimal factual information the makers of this course and especially the instructor obviously have had very little to no experience of any kind with most of the topics they discuss	0
it changes my mind about learning long term before i encountered this course i knew it must be something wrong in my learning method which conduct a very ineffective learningproduct this neuroscientific based course enlightens me in scientific learning and makes me start to think seriously about how to learn more effectively its really a great honor to encountered this course and im sure it would be one of the most powerful asset i ever had in my lifetime my sincere gratitude to dr barbara oakley dr terrence sejnowski how to learn team and all the interviewees invited thank you for all your great insights on me	4
way too many errors in the graded assignment nonreponsive teaching assistants	0
not the best tutor but perhaps one of the worst hard to understand what hes trying to say	0
this course is doable if you have prior knowledge of probability and statistics this is not for beginners and should therefore by reclassified as intermediate and above i am sorry i enrolled in this course i have truly hit a brick wall and can go no further	1
all in all i liked the class i would like to learn about this topic and the database access using python and i still think this is a very good beginning i like the enthusiasm of the instructor but i think he short sells many of the things he is teaching i would also suggest providing more challenging assignments for instance as optional ones these may be such that they require reading the referred text in addition to watching the videos	2
as a developer i consider this a very poor course it can be good for manager and business people to better understand what technologies are available these days but that it you can easily look at the syllabus go to the wikipedia and read the pages on presented subject and you will get the same knowledge there were no programming assignments quizes and exams were not challenging at all and some questions were really confusing i wont recommend it to anyone and it shouldnt be part of this specialization	0
i would like to have more assignment added to this course	3
from the first two lessons i learned the general ideas and brief history of communication science which provides me a frame and an overall picture of developmental path	4
awesome course both professors are very intelligent and teaching perfectlystep by step explanation and also never feel bore because presentation styles are also very best thanks professors and coursera	4
excellent course many useful tips to understand how the brain works and how to help yourself learn better	4
overall okay but feels quite outdated as a marketing professional and child of the digital age i feel like the course didnt go deep enough	2
this teacher reminds me of old aunties that tried to tell me how to think thats just the way it is is never a good reason for me	1
i found this course too advanced for my level of familiarity with statistics its true that most basic stuff is covered to be fair but the progression is very rapidas i work long hours and other commitments i didnt have enough time to dedicate to study beyond the time needed just for this course if i had been able to study an extra  hours a week practicing using the formulas then im sure i would have got more out of it	1
good overview of evolution i appreciated the videos discussing how to best teach evolution in the classroom the instructors assume you have some science knowledge so if you do not you may find some vocabulary and topics are not explained as well as they should be	3
i found the course really useful and informative and the teacher was very enigmatic and engaging my only comment would be that perhaps the teacher goes through the slides slightly too quickly at timesas i found myself often pausing to read them excellent course though	3
extraordinarily dry presentation it was a struggle to sit through each video	0
excellent to get a general knowledge of the three technologies would have been ideal to allocate two more weeks to expand the lessons related to htmlcss and the lessons on javascriptkudos for david rossiter clear eloquent and helpful	3
i think that the theory was very poor in sense of the videos were very short and with little content the topics that weve seen were difficult to learn by itself and a better explanation could be very useful in practice	2
great course and great mentor	4
would like to use the time to learn more machine learningpredictive technique etc	1
not enough depth	2
only for those who are new to everything involving computers if you know how to turn your own computer off and on look for a more advanced course than this	0
it was not very informative	3
the content of this course was great the videos were a little odd at first could be a cultural thing and a portion of the content was obviosly scripted and felt a little more robotic but i got used to that pretty quickly the information aligned with previous study but also brought a lot of new techniques and information	3
the structure is not clear with similar ideas coming up several times examples can be farfetched britannica for ethical blindness  the teachers read the script and sometimes stumble on the words an idea is explained in  minutes when s are enough i am getting bored and very disappointed because it is a very important topics these days i quit thank you anyways	0
very much low details and the course instructor has very slow pace when he is teaching on the board that aaaaaaaa is very irritating	1
quite confused during the majority of this course especially after how clear the first course was was able to follow instructions but did not fully understand why i was doing anything not enough foundation given the final project came out of no where we did not learn nearly enough in the course to be able to tackle that the majority of steps that needed to be taken were not taught in class or if they were they were glossed over i was floored by how the class went form simple to extremely complicated with no transition phase	0
the course is basically an advertisement for the software one of the teachers created i did learn a bit of high level concepts but when it comes to coding the answers is always conveniently my software does this for you i wanted to actually learn about these concepts deeper and implement themi also was able to complete this  week paid course in a few days which should not be possible i have since started the free stanford course taught by a cofounder of coursera and it is much better i recommend it to anyone	0
energetic teacher does a great job of explaining what hes doing	3
i think this course has a lot of value but when i started these course i was unaware i would need a few hundred more dollars and did not budget for such things	0
pros covers lots of good topics about big datacons no real big data exercise	3
good way to go back to the basics	2
this has helped me to stream line my planning both at work and at home many take away ideas that i still use	3
introduction to data structures it wastes a week talking about theoretical complexity when it could have been used for something more productive	2
theres a lack of crucial information such as how to merge angularjs with all the backend a few chapters such as cookies and session could had been skipped even the prof muppala doesnt advice to use them but as theyre easy to teach so theyre explained intead of more imporant thingsim getting crazy to do the most simple thing a mean stack loginso why is not explained the most usual thing here there are no excuses login and uploading files is important to be learned	1
very useful course with lots of applied knowledge one gets to learn how to use r to perform the hypothesis testing	4
awesome course	4
very basic	2
good compact introduction	3
awesome course to start data science with	4
though the course itself is introductory in nature i wish there was a lecture on what and how exactly are these going to be useful with the help of a real life example and also an increase in the depth of the content	2
pretty good introduction to the subjectwell qualified instructors as well	3
def a useful skills to have when starting to interview for jobs this is a hard course to teach to begin with i found the lectures really boring too long hard to understand and just not really motivated well i think the homework problem are good but they are very time consuming you need to use various methods to find edges cases and though that might be a good skill to have as well its just too much to get done in one week and somewhat frustrating when youre only stuck in one test case i think this could be an excellent course with a few modification on the slides and adding more motivations and making shorter homework problems that focuses on the main part of the material for that as oppose to things weve already covered in the previous week at the moment i dont think ill continue this specialization the way its designed	0
not so help full about smartphone now aday everyone knows what is there in smartphone	0
i am giving it a  and am leaving the course because several of the recordings in the second quiz dont work it is not possible to participate when there are technical difficulties like this if the recordings worked i am sure it would be a very fun and interesting class	1
very interesting	3
if you look for improving your communication skills then this course is for you	3
good course on how one could improve one studying it emphasizes a lot on the no pain no gain mentality many techniques are mentioned and are very helpful some may find this to be a bit redundant since you may already been doing lots of the things they are talking about in the video nevertheless it is a very interesting course would recommend the book by droakley since it is a lot more detailed	3
very scattered and long lessons very difficult to learn something that is not textual examination is based on literal terms eg what year was xx reform enacted not the type of knowledge i thought i would get	0
great informative course	2
short but good introduction	2
the course does not warrant the price it has way too little information very dissatisfied	0
simple and informative	4
gentle intro to frp	4
it was not the best course i did in coursera the teacher was distracted and i had some issues in following her the information was sometimes too basic and other time on much in depth	0
good coursei did find the quizes not as challenging as the marketing and accounting courses i took through wharton coursera sometimes it seems some of the professors talk very quickly as opposed to the core mba offerings overall great content thank you	3
great course	4
the link to down	0
needed of specific information to now how to be more creative in schools as profesionales	1
videos are very brief  slide presentations of course outline one has to depend entirely on reading materials to understand the course	1
the whole course is nice and there were lot of new things to learn i am not from an it background but still found it very useful however the capstone was a bit of disappointment i believe they should have included some teaching authority to check the capstone projects for my better understanding the whole capstone is reviewed by peers which is great but as per certification i believe there should be some professional help too i even tried to speak to someone over the phone but there was no number available i ended up with chatting with some one on the help center but that was not very helpful either the course content for operation analytics and people analytics were indeed very useful thanks	0
didnt learn anything new too much of chit chat	0
excellent class but a few spelling mistakes fluoride flouridealso grammar mistakes affect effectisare probably could be more challenging im looking forward to the next class you make thanks so much	4
great learned a lot 	3
whenever examples were given things became much clearer but there often werent examples in many instances it would have been nice if there had been a second take of the video taken to prevent potentially confusing misspeaking from making it into the lectures obviously you get what you pay for and its great that i got a vague overview of the subject for free but i easily aced the course without feeling like im at all prepared to run an fmri experiment	2
i appreciate the effort that went into making this course as well as obtaining the film clips having said that if you want to go deeper into the psychology of memory this course is probably not for you as i progressed through the weeks i found myself becoming less and less interested since i already know the basics of memory and psychology i felt i wasnt learning anything new but the clips of films allowed me to see the films in a new light maybe if i had bought the book that goes along with the course i would have gained more insight but as a standalone course it rates just three stars	2
the lectures are rather simple and easy to follow but its impossible to pass the quizzes with only a basic knowledge of mathematicsphysics only for experts with the information provided in the video lectures you wont recieve a grade theres a lot of extra work necessary with no other help given then some wiki that only a math genius would understand without any further help	0
a good course for someone new to project management	4
great way to learn gcp	4
teaching material is fine the professors explanation is monotonic and he uses textual definitions rather than simple explanations	1
content is not good too scattered content cannot find focusassignments are meaningless	0
this course is very helpful for a beginner	4

very interesting and useful course	3
very good as a broad introduction	3
this was by far the worst course in the seriesthere is a lot of good content in this course that needs to be shared but i just felt the delivery failed in a lot of wayshere are some issues often concepts are thrown out but arent explained clearly speaker glosses over them without giving concrete examples the structure of the course is poorly configured on several occasions inline quizzes test you on concepts that havent been introduced until later in the video forcing you to guess at answers also the assignment portion of the course asks you to submit a word or pdf with images but it wasnt configured to allow uploads you could only submit text in a text box i realized i wasnt the only person with the issue when i graded assignments from others who had trouble submitting their assignment in some cases i believe students failed that portion of the course because they could not figure out how to submit i have some it background and was able to share my homework through my shared drive fortunately the speaker should rerecord his lecture it was obvious or at least seemed as if he was reading a teleprompter there were many awkward pauses between sentences that made it hard to listen to often times the audio presentation were inconsistent with the words in the slide making it confusing because i didnt know which i should be following	0
overall the contents are too fluffy and not very tangible i appreciate though putting the tools into action and having to work on the competitive position assignment it provides great insights on what matters in a competitive market as an optimization proposal i suggest to cover the resources of week one like terms and formulas that is much more crucial than some of the fluffy contents also the companies discussed during the course should not be more known global companies like redhook or the food market examples hence not to restrict it to usa	2
i found the assignment quite difficult as i felt that what we were asked to do was not possible at least not with accuracy no matter how many web pages i tried to analyse and with how many different free tools i seemed to come up with the same  issuesif the page was performing badly which was the type of page we were recommended to choose there was not enough traffic to it to gather any informationdemographics however even when i chose a popular page i was unable to obtain the requested information because it was not my website so i was not entitled to view this information  again returning zero results so i am a little confused as to how we are expected to answer truthfully questions such aswho are the main visitors where are they from where did you obtain this information	1
overall a good class but the required reading links could use some help as they didnt always seem to cover the videos of that section	3
the materials are good but it felt like this class should have a been a week introductory lesson to data science it is definitely now a week class maybe a a week one if you take very easy you end up with a basic setup for the next class that i found very useful	2
an useful and amusing intro to arduino	2
very poor course not at all academically rigorous just a bunch of common sense statements instructors presentation style borders on condescending	0
quite disappointed i thought wed have something more structured or at least different from the previous coursesthe content is here and good but i was expecting reviews from pro ux and not student like the previous coursesthe good upgrade though is that we have clear examples of submission before we send ours	2
this course is exactly for beginners professor is very humorous and excellent  i like this course very much 	4
very little new and does not include more complex sensitivity analysis for corporate valuation	1
way too elementary	0
r labs are too tedious for people with medical or science background we need explanations rather than trying to figure it out on our own	1
its very good and useful course	4
too advanced not enough excel	0
i feel that the training could be more extensive prior to assignments the assignments often cause me to randomly search packages for correct functions to use and how to apply proper syntax etc	2
very difficult needs homework problems guided by videos like statistical inference coarse to make easier	1
my very first online course in a foreign language moreover i loved it because i really learned a lot of new things thank you colleen	3
i think this course if poorly organized the instructor is really trying to show us that the real life data sets and databases are messy but providing only written instructions for me it proved useless i for one need to see what other people are doing and not read long pages of horrible written explanationsi paid for the course just to be able to do the exercises which i also think its a minusall in all it didnt enhance my career prospects mostly because nothing useful was taught here wouldnt recommend anyone to pay for it	0
good course interesting theory opens up a new thinking process for planning classes the dual purpose classes ie content plus the development of some of those characters strengths discussed in the course will certainly be much more problematic than presented also the evaluation of character strengths will certainly be problematic for some time to come but the course is till worth taking	3
the introduction to fusion is more a customer presentation to advanced cad user than a tutorial for newbies	1
generally a fair intro to key topics in cybersecurity and mobility however some of the sources are dated and could be updated given the fastpaced nature of the field still worth some time if you want to learn more about where current trends are heading	2
there are some website errors also i think the videos could be better	1
a nice one indeed  felt good being challenged i will continue to study 	3
this is an interesting topic which i have never really given a thought before eyeopening and really make you think	3
excellent chunking of the material while integrating daily conversational dialogues review and quizzes at the end of each section is great however i would suggest adding the chinese characters to the bottom of the pinyin for future chinese students	3
one thing i regret from this course is the content of the video lectures having watch the first weeks videos i found that the professor mostly just read the slides  and did it in a very faithful and careful manner not to miss a subscript  this is quite devastating for me i can read the slides myself although i have to download it first since the fonts on the screen are very small what i need is the professor to explain the logic behind the formulas the why behind what is written instead of just reading what is written on the slidesi find it amusing that with an expected learning of  hours a week the total duration of the first weeks videos add up to a mere  minutes a couple of weeks ago i have just finished a course that subjectively is comparable in its difficulty level that course is also rich in mathematical content and also requires a commitment of  hours per week each week the duration of the lecture videos amount to somewhere between  minutes  and the lecturer didnt read slides instead he would explain the logic behind the concepts and provided papers for learners to read on our own time that approach really helped scaffold my learningi hope youd consider revisiting this courses learning plan  or probably just state on the course info page that this course is more suitable for a refresher course rather than an introductory one	1
the most amazing mooc i have ever taken	4
old fashioned econometrics course still using the ideas of fixed regressors rather than the more sensible conditional models approach emphasizing prediction instead of causal interpretation etc	0
best leadership education so far	4

too many theory and too boring	0

its good to get started with server side development with node	2
this is excellent course on basic data structure i will encourage you to take this course	3
excellent course full of fascinating cases and concepts and brought to life by the thoroughly entertaining prof adelstein if i do pursue a career in law it will be in large part due to the obvious love this incredible teacher has for his subject matter a resounding 	4
i should suggest my fellow coursera students not to waste their money and time for this course youll learn a lot more than this course has to offer if you consult some websites with screenwriting tutorial blogs read books and write on your owni am a phd student of theoretical film studies and and a fan of coursera courses i was eager to learn screenwriting as an interesting handson course well its projectbased alright but wheres the real guidancethis is a lazily designed course with poor content and almost zero guidance the videos are very short and feels like a layman is trying to motivate you to write something thats all no methods explained other than some terminologies like bible acts outline being thrown at you no examples no comparisons no detailed approacheslastly scriptwriting has a significant difference with other humanities course being peerreviewed doesnt help here  a total novice can not effectively judge another newbies work nor give them quality feedback	0
good one and nice way to learn	4
the early part of the course does not make a compelling argument for why we need to analyse complexity the lectures are interesting but not helpful for use in business	2

good overview for someone new to people management	3
although this course is rich in content it lacks a lot of perspective around the history of graphic design since it only talks from the american point of view	3
structured beginner course for those who have no background in prsocial media for those currently working in the domain youll find yourself skipping through parts of the course as you most likely have already known the stuff nonetheless it provides a framework and examples to take a leaf fromunfortunately i didnt purchase the course hence unable to submit the quizzes  graded assignment	3
a good course that gives insight into how data is exchanged over the internet and how python can be used to manipulate and use that data for each chapter i recommend adding  additional programming assignment with a little more complexityg	3
its a bit hard to answer the quiz since the presentation is not speaking about the qu	2
very productive thanks a lot	4
i had rated this course  star earlier but i am downgrading it to  star now as the course managers  coursera  cbs seem to have abandoned the coursera while the program is still running and being charged upwards of hundreds of dollarsthe final peer assignment date has passed by close to  weeks and the grading process is not completed neither there is any communication from course managers about the samevery disappointing from coursera and cbs for free the course may be still useful as early introduction to strategy but as paid course refrain for the time beingmy earlier review belowdelivery of the course  presentation videos sequencing and articles for each video are very well organized and executed referring cases studies is good as wellhowever the material seems simplified and is very much a basic course and not intermediate or advanced courseadditionally the quizzes are very simple and have ample room to increase the difficulty level in order to make the course more challenging	1

amazing course and helped me a lot in developing ideas and making me better at digesting concepts etc	4
this is a very good course to understand the mechanism of how our earth works and how complex the mechanism is	3
course content some swift specific topics are shortly covered in the videos overall the teaching material is very short in the first week students basically learn how to start xcode week four contains a  minutes video on image processing thats basically it for the weekfollowup readings for week two just provide a link to apples ios developer site thats clearly not enough for a course students can google for tutorials by themselvesproject the projects mentions classes which are not covered in the course it was then also my impression from the peer reviews that some students without prior knowledge were just lostthere are many great tutorials on the web which offer more insights and give students a much more fundamental knowledge than this course	0
i dont want the stars remained void	3
the course content is perfect however the rating system is kind of disappointing first the rating is very subjective thus i might pay great efforts to my submission but get a grade below my expectation second sometimes i can be busy on weekends thus i want to finish the peer review earlier on friday however there might often be not enough submission to be reviewed thus i am very pressured to do this with a exhausted mind and body in the evening on sundays could i just pass if theres no other submission to review	1
very interesting great information and incredible explanations	4
thanks very much for great content and especially ms jana schaich borg for brilliant presentation skills lovely voice and good looking as well please participate this is highly recommend course	4
should provide more examples and exercises for every topic research the web for additional exercises if you want to learn something here	2
i think it the course goes extremely fast i do not agree with its tittle of basic nor the instructors provide sufficient information to achieve the final quiz goal i am not sure about completing the entire course thanks anyway	1
an excellent course  easy to understand programming exercises focus on the implementation of key ideas which saves lots of time in coding	4
a much appreciated course  this course give me a boost in my studies further in web development will appreciate johns hopkins university team if in future you will provide the course on nodejs as well	3
i thought the instructor was very well organized and knowledgeable however the information i received at times appeared more descriptive than informative what i mean is that i feel that we were told a lot about how things are and very little about what to do overall great instructor i had expected more strategy and guidance	1
too many errors in the graded assignments	1
a large portion of the course is just copy and pasting code that is provided to you while the code that is pasted is explained and a lot of content is covered as a result of not having to write it i feel my overall retention is much lower than in other courses	1
interesting course material but there were way too many mistakes in the exercise files i felt we reached a low point when the only way to pass the assignments was to figure out what the instructor did wrong in the assignments recreate those problems in my files and then answer the questions correctly with the incorrect data really bad	1
this course is too short and have little real time example 	0
i was helped by the lessons regarding choosing words carefully	3
the vm doesnt work out of the box sometimes for the hands on activities	1
this machine has learnt well	4
this is a great course my only concern is that it goes slow at times and it feels like topics are being discussed repeatedly i would rather have the wiki lecture notes prominently displayed for my reference rather than having to watch very nuanced lecture videos because i sit through a lot of uneccessary video out of concern that i will miss something important	3
awesome course maybe im not giving myself enough time to digest one topic before jumping to another as i needed to refer past topic often open sourced pdf version of book helped a loti wanted to know if it is possible to generated dictionary from two seperate list and it is possible i was able to zip two list to form a list of tuple and then used dict method to form a dict might not be important but i felt the course will come a full roung when these are covered	3
not really useful as course but only as introduction to other materials feels more like an ad than a real course	0
i found much of the content to be interesting and timely however i thought the quizzes were poorly written there was no feedback so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors also there were many that required more than one answer if you missed one you missed entire question without feedback it was difficult to know which one you missed the week  lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course it was dry and couldve been more global last the large lesson assignment was only graded by peers with no feedback from the instructor	1
i enrolled weeks ago and i found that the system has kicked me out the course i accomplished some themes and now what do i need to start again also i have already paid for the certificate com	0
i think i need more time to finish this curse	2
clear pattern of graphic design history	3
excellent teaching method of teaching with short informative videos 	4
can be taken by anyone with an interest in chickens good references and interesting variety of topics	3
useful course very funny thanks to charles 	3
some interesting ideas unfortunately some of the presentation was so poor that it was impossible to work out what points if any were being presented and for a course called science and philosophy there was far too much religious andor antiscience content	1
although the topics were of great interest to me the videos were not as engaging	2
good introduction to raspeberry but very few about python programming expected more	2
this was an excellent class taught by a wonderful professor professor adams needs to do a followup to this class in the future that expands on subjects taught	4
awesome course to learn parallel programming and advantage of scala to achieve thislearned how to think algorithms in parallel being careful that its not always better to do everything in parallelthe only thing i didnt like that much is that the course has too many mathematical explanations and maybe that lectures should be optional for those that want to go further	3
course is good the reason im giving it a low rating is because its a little redundant with course  introduction to meteorjs development some of the features covered in this course i researched on my own to create the final development project in course  so no much value for me here	1
the qiuz are managed terribly full of error and i seriously doubt the professor ever seen these quiz before the course suit for a beginner but a bit fragile i expect more about building a usable model this course need serious review	0
i was not too fond of some of the commentsthoughts presented ie test gods lady luck that zombie talk and the discreet mention of evolution as the fact  referencing to charles darwin as some great intellect to me that was drawing the idea that the almighty creator does not exist but that is silly given that only now we humans are just coming a tiny bit close to understanding how our brain works and how all the intricacies of the universe function  when he had that all figured out and established from the beginning my point is give credit where its due t	2
well instructed and paced out properly the second half gets more interesting and challenging	4
so the course is a mixed bagpros the lecture content is useful albeit a bit dry i cant give them too much slack for the dryness after all its coding however they could have shown more realtime coding rather than just scrolled through powerpoints with the command window pasted you definitely need to have r open when following along with the lectures the quizzes are also quite useful as youre required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecturecons the assignments assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge and theres no real way to know how to do the assignments just from the lectures the quizzes tend to be on the easy side and the assignments ramp things up quite quickly theres no intermediate material to test your skill you have to have worked in r to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignments	2
wonderfull course it brought me to become a rational buddhist and to start my endeavor in brain study	4
the course is too shallow  amount of topics discusses is quite small practice tasks are boring  implement pseudocode given in lectures no quizzes in particular you can see that it is a bad course if you compare it to the previous  courses in the specialization im agree with other people posting in forums about thatwasted time could spend that month more productively not going to continue passing other future courses	1
this course is pretty old considering how fast this field changes	1
there was a lot to try to remember from one quiz to the next and i have memory problems but if youre a person with normal memory abilities i guess that wouldnt be a problem i really enjoyed learning more about ancient egypt	2
a very stimulating and challenging capstone it is stretching and puts all the  specialization courses material to use it also gives the student a glimpse of what data science in real life is and touches on natural language processing as part of ai	4
the course presents two core approaches to parallel programming  task and data parallelism while these concepts are really useful i expected more details on for example how to implement the _parallel_ construct used throughout the lectures the materials were good and i can use some of the ideas straight after the lectures in my everyday coding but the assignments were really slightly related to the topicbarnes hut simulation assignment id say it has nothing in common with parallel programming in scala it looks like the authors looked for some reallife example or use case for combiners and this simulation model looked nice but really does any developer not working in university would ever use it its completely impractical the most of the time i spent reading the description of simulation model but the coding itself was just playing with d coordinates and some basic recursion id expect something more practical eg implementing simplified form of hadoop mapreduce or something like that so i can use it after the course but barneshut is too specific and is pretty far from everyday problems developers encounter	1
practical suggestions about saving time and being productive	3
good course content but it can be very difficult to get help if you are stuck on something	2
too many concepts were crammed into it isnt basic	1
i was enrolled in the full specialisation and things went great for the  first courses i did which were mostly peerreviewbased logistics  sourcingwith this one i gave up feeling really unassisted and unable to get answers to my feedback requests no feedback is provided when you ask something in the forums everwhen you flag a milestone because of technical issues you wont be ever answered even when you upload screenshots as proofthe practical exercises with spreadsheets are poorly explained and even contradicted especially as far as cutting andor rounding integers are concerned this is something that can prove costly when doing the quizzes i failed all the questions of all the quizzes for all the attempts i tried im not sure if this is courseras fault or rutgers but i dont think i will take ever another course paying here in coursera with these kind of calculation quizzes its a waste of timei cant imagine how a mathematical or programming course must be with this poor approach of assessing the results i suppose i will be censored if i explicitly mention similar sites to coursera but these kind of tests and quizzes are much more better addressedin a nutshell i subscribed to the full specialisation paying  eur per month the first month i was able to certificate myself with the  first i did  logistics  sourcing this second month planning  operations that has just started i gave up so my final outcome is  certificates for  eur each onetolerable but youll never get me here again	0
interesting material and good assignments however this is no assistance when by tas if you have questions which is important since there is no feedback on assignments and hard to know where you went wrong	1
i dont feel like i learned a whole lot there wasnt a lot of new information presented	1
excellent series of courses wish i had done a specialization and had more time to do a better jobperhaps i will do the capstone project	3
i feel like it should have been mentioned a lot clearer before starting that this was simply a course in how to use the creators library these skills are not transferable anywhere else as i would have to pay to use them in future would have been a lot more useful as a how to for scikit and pandas	0
there are some ideas expressed in video that i found helpful the assignments were very helpful as i was able to prepare for the st day of teaching	2
content is good but you need to pay to be able to answer quiz in other courses of that specialization track you even need to pay to do peer assessments it is a shame that education and securing the learn success seems not to be the focus anymore  it seems that focus turned towards monetizationso before taking the course be aware that you can not get a participation rate of  due to locked quizzes which will only be unlocked once you paid	1
very useful and practical content	3
really fun glad i finally finished i got so distracted running off and learning things i got familiar with scala and python along the way too	4
there exist some sort of help for solving programminghowever those bad quiz as well as not so comprehensive courses design totally ruin it	2
some lectures were quite interesting but the generel course level is very low furthermore i think several topics is missing which i believed the course would cover like glp tox cmc ind filing and the topics which are covered should be covered in more depth	1
the video is simple and goodbut the final project and some test are too hard based on material presentedalso staffs support are not good	1
dr chuck is the greatest	4
amazing explanations pushes candidate to try hard with cluesprogram justifies the name programming for everyboycudnt be better	4
the course is comprehensive and the instructors have good teaching skillsthe level is introductoryi would recommend this course to beginners with limited previous exposure to investment management	2
i found that the portion of the class that taught storytelling was painfully over simplified i learned nothing and felt no challenge whatsoever in fact i felt as though i was rehashing information from a th grade english class no hyperbole the other component of this class was learning how to create documents that you could use to pitch your game to developers i found this component to be useful but it could have easily been compressed into a single week if not a single lecture there is no real accountability when it comes to grading work as work is peer graded and students grade capriciously without regard for the criteria laid out in the lecture in other words most students responded to how cool or interesting they found my assignments without regard for the weekly lecture or the grading criteria it often felt as though the lectures didnt matter at all right when the class begins to introduce a more robust tour of laying out a game story it suddenly ends this class is only useful to students who are interested in an area of game design besides writing and who are taking the whole series anyway if you are seriously interested in writing this class will have little value for you and i would recommend skipping it	1
the course could have been covered in a more interesting way	1
well presented and useful assignments mirror lectures	4
standart indutrie daw but not my favorite good performance from the teach i had many issue with pro tools first be sure to get a full vertion and an ilok key from avid before enrolling will save much stress and trouble	2
great job on the course material and labs quizzes and the final exame however tend to be very confusing	2
pros classification lecture is goodweekly assignments are challenging enoughcons no slides provided professor draws on an eletronic chalkboard with a very bad handwriting and you need to keep going back to videos when you are doing the homework for me this shows lack of professionalism and laziness some excel sheets are provided but they are very messy and badly formatted matching the messy handwriting in the videos and the instructions are for mac no instructions for pc are provided whatsoever i never used mac so i had a very hard time very few examples real examples are provided you learn math concepts not excel skills except for the linest function which is very handy but its not taught in the videos i had to google the function to learn it they say to complete each piece of the final assingment after you finish the respective week related to that piece but they only say that as you start week  the course doesnt provide sufficient material for the final assignment you get stuck without knowing how to get to answers some answers to the final assignment are not correct you check the answer sheet and the results arent present in the testoverallid never recommend this course to anyone i only took it because im plannening to finish the specializationive taken several online courses  on excel and this is the worst and most frustating one by far	1
the course give us an excellent understanding of ancient philosopherss thoughts with clear explanations and all this is made with an extraodinary order and conciseness	4
no really what i expected its too advanced for a beginner to ruby and web development but i feel it would be to slow if you read the tutorials and recommended bookswhen first module and tests are very easy and guide well but the pace rushes at the endtheres a lot of parts when well se this later is mentioned which means that maybe the examples are not appropiate for the pace of the coursethe little exams and practices are way too easy compared to the weeks qualified test some parts of the test require to check the documentation or looking in the internet cause it wasnt explained in the videosafter trying some java ruby seems pretty easy but from what ive seen ror should be a tool for startup enthusiasts who require easy prototyping and low knowledge of programmingweb developmentthis course is explained as if the students are programmers  web developers that already use tools like github heroku unit testing who probably dont require that explanation in first place but is not deep enough for newcomersi recommend take a bit more time and include more steps of learning maybe  first course for ruby before getting into ruby on rails and since is an introduction it should include an installation tutorial should i install from repository or a version manager like rvm the gem concept what setup do i need etc	2
idk its not what i expected i really want to start with actually making a computer game not a paper game	1
the whole course based on some proprietary software in general it seems that the main goal of the course is promote that software	0
the teacher of this course teaches great 	4
a nice and complete course about frontend frameworks	4
rudimentary hr  new supervisor level information not specific to data science either	0
good interesting material but the quizzes were badly designed and did not test concepts well	2
very good course to get the foundations right emily has done an excellent job in explaining the material and she reinforces the concepts with examples i strongly believe this course will provide the required skills to explore further topics in this area great job and thanks to coursera for providing us this platform	4
there are two frustrations with this iteration of the series one the quiz questions are often opaquely worded instead of being tested on the material just learned it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions and the most glaring omission was that when students are asked to provide functions only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly if the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then youre moving forward blindly after that then add the quiz questions from problem one above and youre just wasting your time after that and building up frustration validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers dont practice it themselves there are bound to be problemsi like the intent of the course and considering my outsider background to computer science the mathematics etc i did learn a fair bit not enough to justify the increasing frustration i was feeling toward the end of this course i have no intention of taking any more at this point not from these authors	1
the lectures sometimes used to get very boring 	1
very well made well paced better than majority of college courses some errors do pop up midway through the course that should be addressed it can be frustrating to push through these issues sometimes but they are the only thing keeping from  stars	3
logic can be fun but this class pretty much kills that spirit by burying it under pretty horrendous and tedious formalization an intro to logic should be considerably simpler and with more interesting content and exercises	1
the course has really helped gaining practical and applicable knowledge in machine learning algorithms i particularly appreciate the course delivery by prof andrew ng where not only he takes us through the algorithm but also help build the intuition of the methodology for us to customize the algoriths as well for our specific problems thanks so much professor andrew ng for sharing your knowledge	4
best online course studies ive ever had an oportunity from listening to understanding non thinkable about the jazz  improvizations	4
only informative not worth it outside the specialization	1
covered a broad range of religious beliefs about the afterlife solid overview of darwin and evolution as well as good videos eg dawkins hitchens harris the videos of actual classroom delivery with students provided a realism to the online experience both profs were excellent teachers with the necessary skills to handle sensitive topicsthe course could be improved by more clearly written assignments the content of these assignments was appropriate but the word structure was too vague and in some cases disjointedexcellent course well done rutgers	3
its a great course and so is the book that accompanies it however the course and book titles are not entirely accurate it should be called an american history of rock there is relatively little discussion outside of america and this is only to serve the discussion of american rockthe book in particular would benefit from a section at the end of each chapter or sidebars meanwhile on the other side of the atlantic as music becomes more fragmented in the s i imagine this criticism will become more importantanother thought would be if the course put a play list together in deezer and spotify that would definitely star the coursestill its a great course and i really enjoyed it	3
i cant understand why this guy is trying to teach me if he doesnt know how to code	1
changed my mind after watching the cooking the course on nutrition is just ok but the teacher has a very skewed idea about what healthy cooking really is and fails to present with reasons for her recipe choicesanyway i stopped watching the course again the nutritional part is fairly good but if you choose to continue the course at least make sure you keep searching for other points of view as wellbest of luck	1
the materials of the course are very good and the presentation is of high qualitya drawback is the lecturer seams follows too close to the slides so that he looks like reading the written words only	2
the course is very good but in comparison with the first course with dr leigh thompson the instructor in a little bit monotonus and the screenplay does not have any illustrations which is needed badly otherwise the course is very good and informative and a big thanks to the instructor and his respected assistants	3
theres room for improvement aspects are unnecessarily convoluted	1
the contents and quality of the video lectures are greatthe quality of the supplementary materials like the quizzes and the matlab code provided by tas for the assignments are very poor the assignment guides are written with very poor grammar the matlab code is written using the worst coding and documenting practices the automatic evaluation system the system for grade the submissions doestt provide useful feedback as people can read in the course discussion forums students have been asking for months for improvements to the grading systems	1
the videos are so long in time and not very clear	2
very helpful and informative thanks a lot 	4
the classes could have been delivered by creating more interest	2
very useful course to begin with python	3
this course have excellent title but not that great contents it touched html css javascript bootstrap and jquery most of part as just touched contents are too less	2
boring and not that useful	0
excellent course with very useful material on sampling	4
challenging at times but doable with effort and quite rewarding upon success recommended	3
lectures and quizzes are okay assignments are great to make you think deeper about the topics i have to agree with a lot of the other course takers that you get very little help from the teaching staffs however i do feel that the discussion forums are enough to help you through all of the programming tasksprogramming assignments arent really friendly to haskells list and vectors are not available if you use haskell youll be forced to work with arrays or sequences which are not as nice	3
it was fantastic the content of this course im really glad a participated here	4
very nicely made course providing a good hands on with r language thanks	2
hi i loved this course however im a bit surprised that didnt got a certificate for doing it thats why i dont put  stars	2
the framework is ok but it would be more insight on the functions would be much more amplifying the learning processgood working examples though	1
all familes sholud have this vourse as it increases the concious on the importance of home made food and the time spent together with the kids	4
i am very sorry to say that the course is very poor in english speaking too bad you do not teach the course in french this could be useful for a lots of french speaking students and better for the quality of the course	1
compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse  it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses	2
a good beginning to a promising journey	2
i enjoyed the videos but not the assignments i wanted to have fun and learn more about the music that i think makes life more beautiful the final assignment in the module was unclear to me and the feedback unkind telling me to wait a year get outside help and try again is not in any manner fun or helpful i cant imagine doing that to a student of mine a peer or even a stranger nor do i find it in keeping with the claim this should be fun in the end i would rather be an uninformed lover of music than make myself crazy trying to learn it with people that are taking an introduction class and clearly forgot what it was like to be in your first couple of months of learning music it is like learning calculus from the math instructor that thinks some of the steps are so obvious that he can skip them forgetting he has a phd in math	1
although longwinded it is a fantastic course wfantastic insights	3
it was short and interesting and that is good in the first week the readings were overwhelming and i was disappointed  but the other  weeks had short videos of interviews with photographers to go along with the concepts presented some of the quiz questions were looking for details that i felt were not important for the learner final assignment was good	2
very helpful course clearly explained and interesting	3
great course	4
i was really disappointed with this course i took the other courses from brian caffo and truly enjoyed them for the previous courses ive always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material there is a book for regression models but but its a real mess it feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look there is a bunch of wrong code and typos the explanation doesnt go as far as it should i had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course i hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others if they dont review it dont bother paying for it try learning regression models elsewhere	0
this was a great class but some of the information could have been more comprehensive and some of the questions on the tests did not match the information from the lectures	3
the course itself is fantastic but submissions toward the end of the course are extremely tedious and cause you to wonder whether or not you did the math correctly	3
i gave this course  star not because its bad in content its just because i was expecting more due to the fact it has been delayed several times then when it finally came it was like any other youtube or online tutorial i was expecting something as big as udacity but unfortunately its not dont expect to know or understand java with this course no practical or step by step example in this course what makes it worst is the fact they never show you how to build an app from scratch while the only app they have in this course they dont do it you have to do it on your owndont get me wrong all of them are good instructors but the way they did it its definitely is not a beginner friendly give a calculator as an assignment to build while you never built one app in this course i think its not an effective way to teach i will not pay for this specialization i will do the udacity nanodegree one	0
i rate this  because of how accurate it looks i wish it was more practical and that gave some real explanations not just this concept is called like this because it is called like this as i said anyway it has a plethora of notions	2
you are not actually writing any code for this particular course the assignments are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code repository for this course the lectures are great there is a lot to learn from them but the assignments are a total bust not worth it for the money but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization	2
the course was not that clear should have taught more in detail thank you	2
too redundant	2
pros teachers know what they are talking they are energetic and funnycons the course uses proprietary and expensive tool the course is too simplistic the teachers although they know what they are talking about they arent very good at teaching	2
the course instruction is very good if the teradata database is improved the course will deserve  star	3
its quite clear and interesting explanation with some historical background of the derives just sometimes its a little bit long time to explain a theory instead of an intense explanation due to the sync with a real class	3
the course is ok but the certification procedure is a messno statement of accomplishment and you have to retake all the assignments if you want the certificate and had not been verified 	0
course is too slow to keep focus its repetitive but not clear when its really needed	1
not a good course	0
someone needs to reviewproofread the final part and assignment many students wereare confused about the final assignment revise the video too	2
very interesting look at the financial markets and institutions it is particularly clear and wellexplained for nonnative speakers of russian	3
while this course presents great content and valuable information the caveat is in the overall experience the moderators and instructors are nonexistent and cannot be reached there is only one moderator who finally did his job and showed up to deal with some issues that many classmates were having including myself and even his response time is only once every week so he only started checking in once a week after i had already nearly completed the whole course there are also some serious issues with glitches technicalities and not being able to pass assignments and grade others assignments i completed this course a week ago and many of my classmates are not able to complete it due to extreme glitches like the system not taking in their projects and not even allowing them to move forward its such a shame im the lucky one in that i was able to finish the course the others not so lucky theyre still stuck back there and the staff of this course is really just not around and doesnt care its such a shame because like i said the material presented in this course is informative and valuable information	0
great course i learnt the importance and use of a good docstring some of the quizzes are a bit heavy going	3
not recommended for medium or advanced users as the name says this is just an introduction in social media so if you are already using it you dont have much to learn from this one i look forward to the other courses from this specialisation for more in depth content	1
i thought this was poor it was basically a rehash of the previous module with slightly different tasks given that i had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready i found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks dont waste your moneytime on this particular module	0
really amazing course i leaned a lot about pandas how to manage and clean data and extract value out of that ive learned a little about statistics specially hypothesis testing	4
useful and tangible knowledge delivered succinctly writing prompts a bit rigid and specific	3
thank you	3
very challenging coursevery well presentedgreat materialsource of information for studyloved it 	4
thank you profecsor	2
very poor and a complete lack of interaction from mentorstutors learners are left behind shooting bullets at the sky hoping to hit a star that might fall over with some hints the course materials is consistent and very well informed but as mentioned mentorstutors since course began never showed up to clarify some frequent issues with matlab codes and input datafelt disappointed	1
sirthe course is excellent but is it possible to give some solved programming exercise please	4
very good and interesting for a beginner like me i hope others also find use of this freely available quality material	3
nothing special i do understand this are fundamentals but i felt like  year old	0
useless blablabla in general words nothing concrete it is not possible to build embedded system with os after finishing it iot is mentioned just for marketing and promotion if you seriously consider developing osbased embedded system even just reading wiki pages about eos would not be such a waste of time as listening to this course	0
this course provides me opportunity to teach my kids in effective way that is proved to be in line with research on learning second language i rate it the best course in this regard and would like to say special thanks to dr shane dixon and all his team i felt my teaching skills are improved after completing this course but there is still space for improvement in final assessment in my opinion there should be a thorough understanding for the participants of the course on how this final assessment could be beneficial for them however the overall impact can be expressed in a big thanks	3
i very much recommend taking this course it presents basic neuroscience topics as they relate to learning memory and test taking in a simple and approachable way it also encourages you to reflect often throughout the course so that you think of ways to apply the concepts to your own experiences the instructor is an expert and is a great speaker that keeps you engaged i enjoyed listening to the videos while driving my car and because of the courses good structure and assessments feel i internalized much of the information well	4
i study civil engineering and i think the course is a great opportunity for any studentthank you very much	4
interesting info loved the videos 	3
during lessons you dont receive enough information to be able to pass the exams	0
there isnt any real teaching happening i guess this isnt a course for beginners	0
prefer more referencesexamples shown in lectures	2
short superficial and sometimes even condescending towards people with asd	1
lots of application that are discussed within the course have been updated so the tutorials are not longer relevant this made it challenging to utilize the applications to the full extent	2
the course is not bad but i felt that it was just a collection of common sense advice	2
it was a good exercise but there were some inconsistencies between the assignment rubric that was published and the grading key the students use to evaluate your work more alignment between these two would be helpful	3
could be more indepth egkanban part	2
it is ok but too broad to get actionable learnings	2
the lectures are a very brief overview of topics with nothing actually taught the quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages this course is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to upenn coursera and everyone involved its clear that the instructors dont care about students actually learning anything compare this to the underactuated robotics course on edx	0
love it exciting and clear and concise bravo	4
the instructor explains very well examples are easy to learn i learn a lot and i understand korean language better because of this course keep it up	4
very interesting	3
it has been  weeks since i started this course and it is great professor shiller is an excellent teacher and mentor he shows everything very easy and clear	4
poor english hard to follow assignments instructions spread out over  microsoft word documents with no links between them teaches sql with mixedcase namings allnamed constraints and other nonstandard syntax	1
very very long lectures with ambiguous content many information provided are inaccurate and the course doesnt teach neither programming concepts for beginners nor high or even intermediate training for other developersin my opinion its a waste of time	0
as the course has included movies to explain important concepts it never gets boring as a result a link is maintained throughout it is a small course giving a great understanding about memory	4
it is a little bit hard for the newbie of astronomy but i do learn a lot from your course it is quite interesting thank you	3
i was very excited by the topic of this course but quite disappointed when i finally started itthe content of this course has little to do with its promising titlein fact the content lacks any coherency there is no logical development of the course content  its all disconnected facts told one after anotheranother factor is the delivery i know the teachers are italians  english is not their first language and that is fine but they are just reading out the content  thats all they are just passively reading the content from somewhere so it is hard to concentrate because the interactivity value is zero and their accent takes some time to get used toboth content and delivery of this course were disappointing even though i was and am really really interested in this topic	0
good for total beginners if you have even some level of experience with programmingfiddling with computers this is too slow paced	3
its really working	4
i only took this course because i was forced too and i dont think it matters what you eat its just how much you eat you also dont need to eat lots of vegetables and fruit to be a health person just saying plus this course is boring as hell	0
its a  week course but it covers very basics which can be easily completed in one week instead of  weeks  star for funny prof 	2
nice course i really liked how i could proceed at my own pace the computergraded assignments were very helpful and the forums were good sources of info	3
i just starting but the i feel this is gonna be awesome course	4
thank you chuck	4
i have learned a lot of interesting things about machine learning that for me was too hard to understand with advanced books this course gives a clear and general view of machine learning subjet	4
nice idea but too short shallow and with too few practical examplesalso a review of some software out there would have been handy	1
it seems staff do not monitor or address issues posted repeatedly to the forum especially in regards to the final test part  of the specialty the content of the course is great and if someone with the authority to make changes when errors are detected and reported did care for the course i would have have rated the course higher	3
really good organized	2
cannot take the exam i have to pay wtf i will probably pay at the end but i want to take the class first without certificate i cannot prove i took the course	0
its a great course teachers are awesome since theyre capable of getting your attention  of the time by keeping motivation up and making the learning curve really smooth thanks	4
very well illustrated and organized course points made very clearly good learning experience	3
sorry to say that this is not a well prepared course the course video provided is quite short the quiz is rather than nothing and the programming assignments are buggy i dont feel that i learned a lot from this courseupenn has let me down twice hope the rd one will be better	0
the paste of the lectures is too slow much too slow	1
the course is a bit disorganized and could have been better while the topics are really interesting and geoffrey is really knowledgeable a lot of simple concepts have been made seemly complicated from the way they have been presented  often requiring external follow up studies and often discovering in surprise how simple they actually are such as contrastive divergence cd algorithm to train restricted bolazamann machine read wikipedia to get it in under  mins functioning of sigmoid belief net etc i believe the issue arises from slides based teaching where a slide of texts is presented and then there is a long monologue of how that system works from start to end a more useful approach would have been to actually drawandtalk good example of such courses are machine learning by andrew ng game theory esp kevin leytonbrown parts nonetheless the course brings forth a lot of neural net topics and is definitely worth taking if you are willing to study outside the course also	2
it was fun have peer review is helpful however it was mainly one time comment it would be great to start conversation and interaction among course takers	3
the introduction is nice but the problem is the homework design if homework doesnt cover too much of what people learnt in class it is easy to forget materials in class	0
excellent concepts and content poor quiz composition and monitoring by moma staff of discussion logistical hassles tainted joy from the delivery	2
less useful than reading an introductory chapter being able to reiterate acronyms or idiosyncratic mnemonics does not demonstrate any real understanding of this field the minimal information provided and low level of the instruction at least clarified that this specialization is not worth pursuing	0
the first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how nonfinancial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes i really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life a data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business not finding his managers earnings management using an mscore etc	2
as someone who isnt from math background many of concepts thought in here werent quiet clear or intuitive could use more details or pointers to reading materials to help understand the concepts better	2
the lecture presents googles zmot marketing model how it benefited and shaped marketing research and strategies to increase conversion and loyalty it is a good contextual introduction if you never heard of search engine marketing cost per acquisition or click through rate if you know the basics it is probably not a good use of your timei didnt like that the content feels like evangelism for paid google services and most sources of the course are either random blogs or related to interested parties google twitter i still learnt a couple of cool metrics i didnt know about but the course didnt bring any added value to the blog links provided	1
this course deals with cloud migration and change management the technology is treated not as strongly this okay but i whish there would be more case studies and practical examples sometimes it is more like a course about change management and looses connection to the cloud topic however along the course there is valuable information provided	2
it was very theorical than pratical	2
taking this course is like getting lost across a ton of different websites	1
the course is ok but it doesnt give any certificate of completition for free users something that many other course do give	2
this course must be a part of another courseres	0
i really like to the content of the course but the problem of it is that it does not really incorporate the legal skills one acquires from law school and is thus somewhat of a false representation of the case law that is offered	2
for beginners of video game development tool unity this course is a great start i think it would be even better if it can have maybe one or two more weeks for more example projects and cover more about scripting computer visual imaging concepts etc	3
too expensive for what you get 	0
it is very understandable and very practicalproblem solved focused i recommend it	4
mostly common knowledge	1
very hard course very time in mind comsuming	3
great course nice retracing of some notions of the course game theory like pareto oprimality nice idea doing some examples on auctions and voting systems nice proofs	3
a good course to learn the basic tool about financial analysis	4
this class setting is interesting you cannot participate in assignments and quizzes unless pay for certificate	0
outstanding prof	4
the lecturers are fantastic in explaining the details and information really loved it right from the start of the video lectures	4
the course content seemed to be rushed out as a result the quality is not as good as the first two	2
thank for this course i really liked the lectures materials and the assignments this course is helping me think act and feel positive i am working on increasing my positivitiy ratio thank you again	4
did not go over determining a point on a graph of g from two functions but had it on the first quiz	0
fantastic course both the lessons and materials were very educational besides it constitutes a very didactic introduction to ggplot and dplyr	3
no practical learning use case basis discussion all course material is just google provided document	1
 very interesting course about emerging technologies makes one understand the basics of iot and ar interaction as well as functioning no electrical engineering background necessary academic and supportive sources presented at the end of each lesson not very entertaining	2
the course is not bad but the information of the slides doesnt gives you much information to solve the questions you have to go to other resources to solve the math questionsthe simulations are ok very practical and comprehensive but there is no math information about the movement or equations of motion on the slides off course if you have the matlab code you can do reverse engineering and aim the goal if you expect to learn about robotics motion and mobility you have to go to other books of these themesthere are too much questions in my opinion and are tedious to solve or answer	2
short and concise the course strongly aims for usa residents who eat too much if you are that person this course is perfect as someone from another country without health problems there was not much here i was hoping to learn more about food and how to optimize my diet so as to increase energy improve mood increase lifeexpectancy and reduce chances for depression i found nothing about that but its not so bad because the course took me less than  hours and i still picked up a few things 	2
no word best course to improve grammar and punctuation	4
the instructor doesnt give enough info about principles and her presentation skills are very weekthe studying material also are very poor	0
i really liked this course but i think it was too soft i mean i think we spent a lot of time talking about of algorithmia like loops and so on and these concepts are universal to all programming languages instead of it we could spend more time talking about python syntaxnonetheless i enjoied learn python with you	3
very interesting and well organized course	4
challenging and helps me learn foundation of scala and functional programming	4
this course provides you with everything you need to build your own d platform gamethe first  weeks are hands on courses and by week  the training wheels come off and you are to build your own platformer to show to your colleaguespacked with inside information good teacher if you are interested in unity or video games this course is for you	4
an interesting approach to the french revolution time 	3
thank you coursera and university of michigan	4
feels underwritten by the dea and aimed at perhaps high school students very slow pace info couldve been distilled into less than half the lectures i completed the  weeks in  days doesnt really distinguish between users without serious problems  addicts which i believe amplifies gateway effects  experimentation once people meet users who arent brain damaged or addicts creates an exaggerated and arbitrary distinction between prescribed drugs as all good and recreational as all bad and dismisses any possible benefits of substances that are not legal noting only that medical marijuana has been helpful for hiv patients which is certainly an understatement components are also helpful for cancer patients anxiety and more perhaps break this into studies of common drugs how they work  effects and separately the mechanisms of addiction and treatment however i appreciated the reduce harm policy economics	0
amazing course clear and progressive with a lot of contents a must take	4
the course does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand	0
a bit odd this one it hase some points but most of the training is looking on what the other courses are like paying for commercial 	2
this course is the worst i have taken on coursera they just want to mention everything in very short time quiz is much harder than material on video	2
the quiz do not relate to the lecturesa lot of thinks need to be explore in documents outside of the course and the knowledge of the student has to be higher not a course for not engineering background	0
a good course but it could be better	3
this course is very bad i would like to say this course sucks compared with my sql course no matter how it is structured or how the instructor conducted the course the instructor is very boring and does not explain very clearly even when i start he does not clearly clarify how to start to use r he was just talking about what the powerpoint shows i will absolutely not recommend this course if you are beginners  stari will give a little credit to swirl a practical tool provided by this course to learn r by yourself thought the instruction of the r program itself but for the later part of swirl its confusing sometimes however i learnt much more from swirl rather than from the instructor i cant understand what he is talking about but you have to make it clear thru using swirl he said the swirl is an optional part but he does not realized what he shows is much worse than swirl  starsoverall i dont recommend this anyone especially if you are beginners	1
it may be a  weeks course with a more slow learning because we see some tags in a second and it passes and the autograder works really bad i do not know where i fail but i failed all the questions a peer grader would be nice for the final project	1
excellent material i thought the lectures were very well organized and expertly presented and my interest was kept up throughout the course the only thing i would like to see is some more challenging homeworkquizzes to help drive home the content i came in as a financial markets newbie im a computer engineer by trade and my interest is definitely piqued to learn more thanks prof shiller	3
the course is good but it does not has lecture slides that is better for students to understand	1
this course is really good and helpful	4
interesting to say the leastwhy cant i access my certificate i paid and successfully passed	0
not a very interesting class only learned some vocabulary and some pre made sentences but no general structure or grammar this means that it would be impossible for me to even guess how to form an other sentence with the words i know	0
the contents of this course could be interesting but they end up being terribly boring the course lacks examples to bring things to life a pity	1
i thoroughly enjoyed the class the only reason why i did not give it  stars is because i would have liked to have seen one of the design projects reviewed by the teacher or a teachers assistant i appreciate the peer review but hearing from someone with experience can be very reassuring	3
the final assignment could use a little bit of work from a clarity standpoint i actually think that the exercise is quite rewarding but the expectations of and directions for participants arent entirely clear and thats coming from a native english speaker	2
positive aspectsreadings were relevant and interestingi learned a loti was challengednegative aspectsprogramming assignments took significantly longer than suggested i have  years of programming experience and am fluent in  programming languages but im new to pythoncourse did not provide enough support to learners youre on your own to learn the material and you wont get timely responses if any from the staff i asked clarifying questions about lecture material on the discussion forums and got no response twiceseveral concepts were not taught with appropriate detail  explanation for example there was no instruction on how to read error messages in python	1
this course requires that you already are a manager or are in a position very similar to a manager more importantly this course is filled with neurobabble the fact that the hoax by now debunked of the positivity ratio and the attractors of happiness are still in the course and presented as fact is a big red flag not recommended	0
the assignment instructions and grading criteria are unclearincomplete because of this given these are peer graded assignments it is likely to lose marks because the peers interpreted the instructions differently some of the topics covered in the lectures are not covered in the assignments while other topics which are not covered are all assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code the lecture videos contain a lot of code examples but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the api sometimes the code examples in the slides contain mistakes it sometimes felt like the content covered in the videos could have been delivered in a much shorter time	1
difficult but interesting course	3
too easy and pretty long for me	2
contents are very good and assignments are challenging perhaps i struggled most trying to understand what the questions actually ask they should be rephrased or be more clear but it was a nice course and i would to it again i am waiting for the next courses to begin	3
it would be nice to see more examples especially were we have too many formulas i still confused with probabilityalso hadwritting isnt really helping i am most of the time decoding scripts in addition he is reading the formula at one moment and in around  seconds it appears on the screen so i kind of listening him while trying to read what is happening on the screen horrible experience	2
while this course might be suitable for somebody new to this topic it was not very useful for me i have read numerous articles on the topic so it brought me nothing new	1
the gobbledygook mooc worst bunch of talking a lot and saying nothing i ever encountered	0
useful programme with helpful insights in learning	3
exceptional course useful and well focused opened new ways to efficiently learningthank you	4
angular  not angular  which is disappointing but worse still it teaches use of scope which is no longer recommended by the angular team themselvescould be vastly improved by using modern angular best practice such as controller as syntax and teaching you to write code that is more compatible with angular 	1
poor visual communications it should be better since it is the only way to follow the courseshould be nice if the slides counted with a kind of animation to enphatize what we are talking about	1
very nice way of leaning python programming for beginners 	3
i found this course useful since i had no previous experience of pandas or the statistical features of python i have programming experience and feel i would have found it quite a challenge otherwise but not prohibitively so chris is great at explaining things in an accessible manner and im very much looking forward to going into more detail in the rest of the specialisation i would have enjoyed a little more focus on statistics etc and a little less on the mechanics of the library but understand why it had to be approached this way	2
lots of bias on evolutionary theories	2
great class that gives you not just an intro to tableau but takes you through to becoming an intermediate level user i highly recommend it if this is the field youre looking to enter or the skill you want to add to your resume	4
the course was choppy	0
very helpful but sometimes it is too slow	2
i did that course as my last in order to complete the specialization and i must say this is the best course for beginners i have ever encountered	4
learnt many things now i have a very different view on priorities and utilisation of time	3
this is excellent brilliant structure and engaging tutors i am very happy i discovered it and looking forward for certification once i have enough money saved up to pay the fee	4
very useful thank you	3
the course is very good	4
interesting course and worth doing could be completed in a day or two if youre just viewing the videos and answering the quizpositives the content is interesting and it gives you plenty to think about and a decent grounding to go away and learn more if you decide tonegatives first week doesnt add much the videos are awkwardly delivered and the analogies are a bit contrivedoverall a good primer before moving onto other courses as it could plant a few new ideas that will be valuable	2
thank you for these great opportunities for learningt	4
i believe this course is great at all but i also have to say there are a lot of machine learning algorithm should be taught in this course such as decision tree naive bayes etc	2
interesting and helpful	2
the instructor does a very poor job of explaining the material	0
the professor is really capable so interacting and hence making the course a wonderful one	4
to be honest i dont think this is worth the money	0
the course is really way to easy it could be done all in one day definitely not worth 	1
as for information in course itself it was interesting for me to enroll and to be part of the coursebut i highly dislike that there was a feeling of that the lecturer is trying to remember any things right while the video goes it is not a real class it is a video and it could be done much more accurately there were many many boring moments while management itself is not a boring discipline it is very interestinganyway i am glad i participated in the course	1
i didnt think there were many solid pointersand not much that was original coming from the instructor herself	1
excessively short course like previous course in the specialization no slides of the lectures were provided approach oversimplistic ie could done more also as in previous course there was no supervision from the staff of the discussion forums also looking at the big picture there is a tremendous gap in quality and approach to online courses between eu institutions and us top tier institutions favoring the us offerings looking at wharton u michigan yale courses just to mention a few and then looking at the majority of european offerings the gap is very salient if ie wants to stay relevant in this online space some benchmark is advised if you are in the game you must play it betteri hope you will accept my critic as constructive and positive not as negative as an european i am more critic and i would like to see more quality relevance and credibility of eu offerings as it is it is a matter of time until wharton and u michigan spread their offerings into this specific field and with a superior approach they will most likely divert students to their offerings probably lowering and marginalizing your coursesbut despite my critics it is fair to salute you for your efforts and availability to offer this coursei wish yoy luckricardo j oliveira	1
the materialinformation required for the capstone was not covered in the lectures and required considerable additional time and effort to find via online forums and the galaxy pages themselves a manual of code examples and types of jobs would have been great further a better use of time would be to start doing the capstone on day  and do all of the lectures and quizzes later as the quizzes were very easy and anecdotal but the capstone required more time then scheduled in the course	0
really informative equations were a bit difficult to understand i felt that there was a bias towards anthropic principle	2
good and interesting course	3
quite concise and learning great	4
not what i expected talks more about the professional settings where conversations are going to take place and not about helping student with their professional english speaking skills	1
good insight into marketing analysis and the use of r	2
i am sorry but the prof doesnt know how to attract students to be more curious	0
no instructor participates in discussion no one ever passes the programming assignment because it wont accept any answer	0
i like the course very much because it gives me different aspects of modern art  ideas appreciate all instructors	4
i did not know what was going on and i have to stop	0
instead of interviewing different people it could have animations and infographics to explain the research methods	2
not a very good course layout	0
the videos are quite interesting though i think they are overly committed to very specific techniques i did not however find the assignments and peer review system very helpful people had a tendency particularly on the first assignment to read in requirements that were not actually stated or written down and failed people accordingly there also does not seem to be enough people to review all of the assignments eitherperhaps due to the paywall for assignments the very nature of the peer review system also guarantees you see a real range on the individual criteria you are evaluated on and the depth of the review this exacerbates the very harsh  or  point option for all assignments ie either you get a  and pass or you get a  and failbottom line i think the course materials are useful and at the very least interesting for developing writers but im not sure its worth the  entry fee to gain access to the peer review unless you really need or want the course certificate	2
very good introduction to a more healthy life style	3
the videos and explanations are very poor most of the time the instructors are reading off a script and everything feels fake by reading off a script they are forced to handwave and do not explain concepts covered completelythe only thing i liked about this course were the problem sets which were interesting to do will not buy rest of specialization feels like this is just a cash cow for ucsd	1
it is a great coursei have learned a lot 	3
some of the interesting topics discussed in this course could be treated substantially more extensive and detailed in order to get a better grip and understanding on them eg gibbs sampling after this course it is a bit dazzling how much different algorithms and methods are available for clustering and retrieval tasks and this course easily could have been subdivided into two or three separate courses on the same topic with a more detailed treatment still about many interesting subjects a tip of the iceberg has been brought to you  it tastes so good that you would like to have much more	3
i find the week  of this course completely irrelevant also im attending courses on coursera to learn and quizzes are imo an essential part of that process but definitely not essays for me personally essays are just waste of time and theres nothing beneficial about themanother thing that bugs me is how questionably and often misleadingly are thermodynamical laws interpreted by the professors in this course	0
trivial course	1
this whole program is so knowledgegivingthanks to coursera and university of kentucky	3
i loved this course every subject was treated very throughly and with a historical view that allows you to understand major events in worlds history also every concept was explained very clearly through simple words and examples i would recommend this course to any economics fan such as myself that has no prior studies on the matter	4
provides a very summary overview of a very important aspect of data analysis expected more	1
good but could have been a little more demanding	2
very important materials are explained super briefly i would only suggest it for getting familiar with the estimation keywords and terminologies or for someone who wants to brush up hisher prior knowledge in estimation the total session time for all  weeks together is only a few hours and the homeworks do not cover the session topics	1
extremely easy and sparse content	1
i had initially started the course in order to gain insight more into the role of wind energy the operations the components and financing behind it the course was a little heavy on actual mechanics and turbine output calculations wouldve enjoyed a more descriptive course with more emphasis on the financing and operational side as well as how the wind facilities fit into the grid that said it does provide a great basic overview of the concept and the mathematical side is still useful particularly if interested in the engineering aspect	2
it seems like the course loses its focus about onhalf of the way through it stops being about music and suddenly becomes a discussion about liberal social issues i completely lost interest in it at that point	1
for me the courses biggest valueadding point is to simply ask us to google everything on stack overflow to complete all the assignments which has almost nothing to do with the course content the assignments are also badly designed in the discussion forum you can see lots of confused  frustrated posts the tas and mentors are clearly underresourced to answer all our questions the videos unfortunately dont teach us much either the professor  tas a simply reading off a teleprompter and theyre rushing through everything ive done some amazing courses on python also offered from uni of chicago but this course has been a big disappointment unfortunately	2
good course good pacing if you have never done any programming might be a bit too slow for anybody with any programming experience	4
the contents were interesting presentation rather poor the speeches seemd disorganized i had to rely on transcrips downloaded and edited the comments are at times too casual and other times too much special terminology most of times i understand what she was trying to say but listening attentively was very difficultheavy americanism impedes understanding especially when the student does not have familiarity with us pop culture i had to check how a pinball machine works zombis and fourarmed impossible octpus were obstacles	2
course is good to get initial background of big data and to understand whatwhy big data	3
i would give  stars if i could this is a very good introduction to the whole machine learning specialization series given the topics covered especially with practical cases however as a standalone course it lacks depth for a  star rating	3
this course rushed through the material at the end	2
i think it should have a webboard to ask between teacher and student or other students	3
very good to start understanding economics from zero	3
good material let down by instructors	1
the course is good but not very challenging anybody having done any course in statistic would have little to no information from the first two weeks only week  was interesting to me dealing with boostrappingthe teacher is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way one always understands what he or she is doing	2
rather superficial the poorest one of the modules so faryou have to shoot at the end i wish i new it in advance i wouldnt have enrolled	1
good course to start with the basics of photography group assessments can be hit or miss given varied experiences of other students but overall a good place to start	2
the course is excellent and the professor randly hlavacs lessons are pretty interesting and interactive besides the tools he share are the best in the market thanks northwestern university for the opportunity	3
thank you	3
the course is quite short videos are usually only  minutes long and therefore could be completed very quickly andor need quite little time investment i did not like that they do not have any written materials cause at some points they go over written slides very quickly and it is tricky to follow and understand on the other hand there is a lot of repeats and therefore you will understand everything in the end	2
course should be more interactive and details	3
pdf course like a school	2
could have covered more areas and with more examples for features not bad for what it is to serve as guidance	2
i enjoyed the course overall but the hr componentperspective was only somewhat useful beware of the final unit week  the takeaways and the final quiz are not well aligned in the weeks final project though the questions doesnt ask for them be sure to explain your rationales when reviewing your peers work the points rely on whether youve explained yourself cheri alexanders inclusion of videos felt like filler and the notion of having to create a video as an assignment is timeconsuming and ultimately not necessary to our learning because i experienced a great course with two of the three professors in leading teams i can only conclude that professor alexander designed the final assignment criteria and quiz these components were not clear fortunately my classmates were very supportive and understood the spirit of the assignment its a good class but i enjoyed the first one in this specialization more	2
total disaster i payed euro for this course course started on  i faced with technical difficulties till this weekend i reported this problem already many times finally this weekend the jupiter notebook worked and i started the first assignment i spent many hours but still couldnt get solve the assignment i read discussions write post searched on google read lots of document i still couldnt get what the correct answer is the assignment wants i realized that it is impossible to pass this exam in the lectures they dont mention anything which will help you to solve this time consuming assignment by the way after having this terrible course experience this weekend today  i decided to apply for refund but guess what i says  days have passed so i cannot get refund now i payyed  euro for nothing but disappointment	0
between the book plugsand the seemingly partisan descriptions of later presidentsthe course goes from a factual overviewto a meandering book pitch	1
challenging interesting rewarding and fun	4
nice course and sequenced well	4
i think that this course could have more content	2
i would like to see the end date of the course linked to the start date of the next course part  without a few week time lag or a one week lead time it would nice to have the option to keep going while the material is still fresh in my mind	4
a good intro to pr  but course material seemed somewhat redundant and lacked challenge at times professors enthusiasm and passion was contagious and greatly appreciated	2
this course is misleading in a lot of ways it is not for beginners at all the quizzes in the course are beyond impossible the lecture videos give an introduction to some concepts but you are left on your own to figure everything out they do not provide the proper tools to enable students to understand or pass reading through a lot of the discussion boards there are two types of students  those like me who have never programmed in their life and cannot figure any of this out and  those who have all sorts of experience and write things that are way advanced for a beginners coursedo yourself a favor and seriously do some research on appropriate programs before signing up for this one it needs to be structured way better than what it is now	0
this course is wellorganized although with the course going on i t goes more difficult it is also a good challenge for us	3
unfortunately as a course designed to teach rails it is poorly paced and has a few issues the course content is spread out over three weeks as followsweek  they go over setting up a ruby on rails development environment which was fine they also went over git and github while you can access all of the course content on github you are never actually required to use git for any of the work in the course and it only shows up as a few questions on the only quiz in the courseweek  they cover ruby programming and syntax there are a lot of different sources where you can find tutorials and such for learning a new language and in this course the material was good enough they also offered a number of practice assignments with self grading capability which is a nice featurethe graded programming assignment for week  gives a lot of information about how to set up your environment and stepscommenting to assist building out your code however there were a few requirements for the graded portion of the assignment that they dont even tell you about expected return values under certain situations until you actually run the grader they werent difficult but their reasoning were never explained in the course and it made the code a little more awkward than it needed be to passweek  is where the major pacing problems occur there are a number of very broad stroke videos on rails as well as several brief videos covering a number of third party libraries or tools sometimes required to build rail apps a lot of the content they cover isnt even utilized in the assignments of the coursethe week  assignment instructions are actually incomplete they tell you a number of prerequired packages you have to install including ones you had installed from previous assignments but they leave out others you will need and leave several development environment issues you end up having to work out on your ownand where as the week  assignment was almost overly handholdy on showing you where in a ruby file structure to implement your code week  hardly offers any guidance on where or how to implement your rails structure the broad stroke videos from week  kind of give you an idea as to what each piece of code is doing if your working from a template but the assignment feels obfuscated when trying to build it from scratcha major issue also comes from a third party website they require for completion of the assignment and that requires separate registration to use during several periods over multiple sessions of the course the third party site went down and was unavailable for as long as  hours at a time during which it was impossible to properly run or debug the assignment due to its requirementwhat the assignment is asking for isnt even terribly difficult when you do understand what is required and the code is rather simple and minimal to implement but you end up having to figure out a lot of that either off site in which case you are not learning from the course or by modifying a copy paste of some of the templatesscaffolding from the course github content in which case you dont get a good reinforcement of the materialin the end i wound up getting a certificate feeling like i passed despite the course rather than because of it there is some good foundation for a course in here but it just falls apart in the third week and lacks any real depth	1
very fruitful course with many interesting new topics to apply in our everyday lifethanks	3
good clips but annoying music almost in the foreground hard to hear voices sometimes	3
a very good course well presented by the prof many examples with solutions in excel that helped to make it clear	3
errors in the material made it difficult to get through all past discussions on the forum are gone making it difficult to review posts by classmates	1
i didnt like this course so much great part of the content is about mediation arbitration and negotiations that are not sucessfully i thought id see more about improving practices to negotiate and convince the other part in a negotiation	2
that is awesome course  but  there is not any support from staffs for example in answering in discussion 	3
too simple no programming just theory	1
the exploratory part was very good but pca was a waste of time	3
i could not upload a correct video as i do not have the knowledge to do so but i didnot get to finish the course which i think is unfair there should be some other ways of uploading the homework i have given two stars not because the course is not good but because i was unfairly given less marks and as below is not passed did not get to complete the course	0
good for what it is a rockbottom basic introduction i would have appreciated more technical instruction in how to create complex involved visualizations and less philosophizing and design ethos a better name might have been what is data visualization a course in tableau for nonprofessionals or something like that	2
this course is not for meprincipal concepts seem very difficult from the first lessonprofessor hesitates quiz is incomprehensibleso good bye  i do like blues and listen it very often but this doesnt help me	1
excellent course structure and it was very easy to understand the best part of this specialization is that the lectures quizzes and assignments motivate to keep you going thanks	4
the best angularjs course i have ever take very well explanation and yaakov is great intructor	4
you will learn some command line commands git github and what you will need for eventually using ri was a bit annoyed that this course is a requirement for the data science certification which is what i am after i already knew everything taught in this course and was a bit annoyed i had to pay for this in order to complete the track i think courses that are fully setup like this should be optin not required	1
it is a great course so far with a lot of applicable topics covered however i feel that some of the questions are structured poorly to achieve their goalsit is fine to have difficult questions where students are expected to do a lot of extra research but it should done in a way that they students know what they are getting into ahead of time and not include questions or code that does not run without explaining what is supposed to be doneits just not a good teaching technique for learning	3
various helpful techniques but i did find the course rather boring especially the multiplechoice questions and all the scientific facts about the brain it also seems more geared towards highschool or university students than towards the general public so maybe i was just not in the target audience	2
the content and the speed that they teach you r are actually good but considering that we now have to pay  for the course you will expect more polished videos and quizzes some of the videos are just stutters repetitions and filling words its seems like they have been in a rush without decent preparation also one of the quiz questions was simply wrong this should be fixed furthermore some of the commands they present are deprecated and cannot be used anymore	1
if you already took statistics this is a reasonable refresher however it is way too brief for the amount of material covered	1
this course isnt as clearly outlined or carefully prepared as the others in the data visualization specialization	2
videos are easy to understand and follow but theres sometimes to little background knowledge about writing good apps security and good practices the communication with the server and what would look like the final working product is not explained at all	2
the course is great it would be amazing if we could receive more feedback but everything is awesome	3
insightful	3
great mix of low level technical details exposure to a variety of topics and high level strategies	3
this is clearly not the right medium for prof clifton this was inferior to the first installment which had a great many problems on its own poor on camera delivery lack of familiarity with the material and a tendency to just read the ppt slide on the screen are just a few of the problems while the content is good you really have to work to get through the presentation of the material	1
the course is challenging and designed to encourage learners to be independent and make full use of the discussion forum as long as learners do not lose sight of the fact that help is available they will enjoy this course but if they lose faith this would be a disaster	3
great content and professor i recommend it	3
disorganized	0
very poor css content	1
the course is awsome to get motivation and quite informative however it teaches lot of practical concepts using tableau which is a commercial softwaresince these concepts entirely new to me it take me a lot of time to understand videos and still im afraid ill forget the things as soon as i leave it i think some more practical activities should be introduce on free platforms to make knowledge more sustainable	2
the videos didnt work correctly sound and subtitles i suggest to fix the problems because it is hard to understand the content of the course if the problems reamin	1
i think there needs to be more association elaborated between the video lectures and the questions being asked during the lectures it seems these questions are asked before the lecture itself tends to touch the point of itsecondly it was a bit difficult to associate the assignment writeups to the lectures obviously they were relevant but this should be more clear in text and video	2
it was interesting and informative course however i found difficulty in relating lessons and get true meaning of the course	2
very little prerequisites professor andrew ng explains the complex algorithms very neatly and tries to provide a intuition behind each algorithm	4
feels like there is an extreme disconnect from the tutorialslectures and the programming assignments the programming assignments were at times rather difficult and had little to do with the lectures from that week overall i feel like i have a decent base in r however i still feel like a lot of concepts were lostnot explained thoroughly enough	2
i really enjoyed learning about how light and frames of reference can affect time and length and what consequences these results have it was a well outlined and explained course	4
good foundation but very basic	2
good intro course for people trying to understand data science role in genome related data and other informations	3
very good course with good assignment questions	3
a bit tedious but lots of information	3
the course is interesting but in the other hand is too basic if you already have some knowledge about negotiationg it wont give you a lot of knowledge	2
the assignment questions are unclear due to which a lot of time has to be invested	0
finding this course very useful and practical one criticism is that it takes a sudden leap in the last week expecting that you have a business idea that you a ready to start executing on	3
great course i learned a lot but it had a lot more content about evolution than just dogs	4
i think this class is best for academic people i did not find what i was looking for	2
so far i have completed week  course its quite interesting and feel like reading a research thesis	3
a good introduction for beginners aka people who are not involved educated or interested in public health healthcare alternatively seek another course because it is very simple	2
the content is good but the delivery is not engaging or creative enough	1
a good course that lacked practical information on performing a metaanalysis	2
a great course	4
i hope to learn more how you wrote the code in class	0
it is very good for someone to have basic knowledge in this subject and want to stu	3
good course very interesting i would like to see the professor grade the course papers or at least review them instead of stric	3
requires payment to complete the course	2
video lectures did not provide much information coursework instructions were unclear and had typos i enrolled in november but the course start date kept getting pushed back by a week or two at a time until it was ready  months later with all of the extra time taken to put the course together i expected to get a lot more out of it	1
amazon professor very well organized and structured course highly recommended if you are a beginner or want to remember python	4
its a good course for introducing students to html it gives a broad intro but you have to take it slow	2
great information on the topic of influencing people	3
you have to use adobe illustrator to make the infographic and i didnt think the course did a good enough job giving the basics for that i had to do a lot of googling to figure out how to do stuff on my own all of the assessments are done by the people in the course and i thought people were a little too harsh if someone is completely new to ai then it is a bit much to expect the infographic to be magazine quality	2
yeah i would give zero if possible very shallow and general cannot learn much from it if u want a course about neuroscience theres way better course than this what the hell emory what hte hell coursera i feel less and less sincerity in courseras mooc these days edx is doing a much better job in my perspective	0
great course that require to use all the topics you have learned in the previous courses of the specialization	4
it was too slow	0
pay to submit assignments ggall the stars goes to the prof	1
not well prepared course	1
one of the main presenters who led about half of this course would greatly benefit from an editor to help them organize their ideas this and a presentation style that made me feel talked down to similar to reading a story book to a small child made comprehension of ideas frustratingly difficult the content they were responsible for covering was why i signed up for a paid multicourse specialization though i learned lots of other things ill no doubt find helpful i did not walk away with the information i need the most the other presenters were great as usual and presented their topics in a clear concise manner	1
better than stat inference and gave some reasonable intuition but could be improved i think by focussing on more understanding and less maths and formulas some of it did seem to be  here s a formula plug the numbers in to get the quiz question right whereas in reality in the world of work that question is completely unrealistic  you have raw data and you need to do the regression and understand what it means	2
a lot of reading existing content less from the master himself  was hoping to get more business case examples still an amazing introductory course thank you	2
thank you i learned a lot	3
this course is not well designed there are multiple mistakes in the videos assignments etc the content is covered after you already had to apply it in an assignment in a previous lesson the tests are also not well made the instructions to peerreviewed assignments are not clear and will not bring you to the correct result which is shown during peer review no involvement from the faculty no one to answer questions	1
the class is very very basic for the offered price not suitable for someone from computer science background looking to learn python as this can be done with couple of hours of self study not sure why coursera would make such begginers class mandatory for the specialization	0
i have yet to have any of my essays reviewed although i have finished every requirement of the course im very disappointed i hope that the directions given to me by the course attendants will correct this problem however	1
wonderful course a lot the information and resource	4
it was way too theoretical the concepts were not clearly explained the tests had concepts that had not been explained and the teacher is not good explaining it it is too monotonous	1
in general a well made course however i do not yet see the advantage of using bluej over eg eclipse as most people wont work with bluej after the course	3
it would probably make more sense if it was titled project management capstone project or project management capstone or similar other than that no complaints a single peer assessed project to put into practice what you have learned in the other modules of the specialisation	2
everything is fine so far but id have had more exercises to work out	3
redundant poor explanations and a complete lack of examples about the general concepts and the foundations of this discipline the interaction between the teacher and the slides is limited to a reading exercise that does not provide any add value at all very dissapointed and still wondering if this course is worth my attention and extremely limited time or not plenty of room for improvement	0
pretty basic stuff but you have to take it to advance to presumably more interesting material	2
course material is a bit light missing useful pieces of information the example code is functional but not of sufficient standard to pass the documentation exercise the solutions to the exercise are not covered in the course material it takes a lot of outside work to get a good mark course is good but the material needs a bit of work	2
many mistakes in the slides and poorly defined problems in the assignments have gone uncorrected for over a year the content is very basic as would be for an introductory course but can even serve as a refresher for cs graduates	1
i enjoyed the course i wish there was perhaps a little more evaluation along the way maybe occasional inlecture questions but otherwise very nice	3
the course way ok but it had some flawsit was very general and could have gone into more detail but that was intentional i guess no big deal then again the difficulty was way too easy and the quiz questions should be tested for test wiseness what i disliked the most the way scrum was introduced and mapped to the role of a product manager was very confusingstill not a bad course though	2
it was a great coursehowever i expect more discussion in foro and the proffesors opinion	3
i didnt learn anything about data science i could have learned how to install all those tools by myself	1
in this course dr chuck will teach you how to visualize data and work with ityou cant miss it	4
love coursera but was disappointed in this course being a true beginner wno background in programming or data science i felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the swirl exercises which i felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate and lectures i spent  hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in i was able to figure out workable code for most problems but i feel like i am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems	1
it teach us how to run calculation in excel it does not teach how to do calculations to decide a specific saa how to pic stocks how to make decisions in real life	2
pretty good coverage of a variety of financial markets this is an entry level course for those with basic understanding	3
not so good lack of interest and practicability	0
the materials are not deep enough and the programming assignments are just soso	2
update as i proceed to wk  i know why there are some complaint on dynamic programmingreduced to  stars lectures are totally useless for the assignmentthe course is really good until week  when it deteriorates very quick no matter how many times i rewatch the lecture i cant understand much i ended up using wikipedia for the quiz instead pi cant use much of the course forum since there are too many posts there and it keep crashing my chromethis course gets my  stars from the first  weeks alone otherwise it gonna be  stars	1
the lessons are not very clear and have almost no examples to make matters worse the discussion forums were closed so you could not ask anything to clarify things so it was very difficult to learn things here	0
this is a really interesting course is helping me a lot looking forward to complete this class	4
ok course difficult to follow at times the assignments and reading make it worth taking	2
background is not clear and not able to understand lecture	0
fun short and concise i finished it in one night and i loved it	4
not on topic not honest and dogmaticalso the auto emails continue after unsubscribing from the course	0
i cannot take the quizzes because of money the other courses let us take the quizzes without paying money i dislike you paying policy please let us take the tests without money paymentsincerelygarik	0
test errors no answers from staff on forums poor narration at times audio scripts that do not quite correspond to what is being said it needs careful reviewing and more userfriendly features being introduced by the organisers	1
this course is quite outdated i didnt learn much beyond what i already knew before i started the spark courses from edx are way better than these hopefully big data analysis with scala and spark from the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne also from coursera is good i know their scala courses which are taught by martin odersky are quite goodthere are very few quizzes between lectures and the assignments are not very challengingmany of the videos specially the ones at the end were extremely rushed over they serve more as a review if you know the subject otherwise i dont think most people will get much from themthe audio isnt very good for most of the lectures many having an very annoying chirping sound from when you leave an old flip phone near a computer tehtehteh tehtehteh tehtehteh tehtehhhhhh gosh i havent heard this sound in maybe over five yearsthe kaggle competition at the end of the course can be fun if you do the hard work but you dont need to put much of an effort to pass i know that the submissions i peer reviewed were quite poor but the grading criteria that we need to follow as reviewers is quite vague and not very thorough you also run the risk of getting a lesser grade than you deserve because your reviewer is incompetent which is a bummer at the moment the course has very few people taking it the same people i peer reviewed also reviewed me which leads to me to believe that maybe only  or  people were taking this course during the november  iteration	0
would have liked to have more assignments and content on imagemaking rather than a focus on making a book i feel like i got just as much imagemaking experience from the intro to graphic design course offered by cal arts	2
it is too easy even for beginners topic about dictionaries would be useful or is there any second part of the course assignments are too easy to cheat lectures are awesome nothing to add	3
difficult to follow if you are new to any type of programming this is not a beginners course best to take this course after trying swirl data camp or code school	1
easier than the last course i took to follow however still this contains advanced information when it is supposed	3
slightly updated according to michaels questionsthe course is fine but comparing to the previous one  algorithmic toolbox  this one is weaker and with lesser qualitypros the course contains some interesting data structures and valuable observations the starter files for assignments are in place related books are given after each video session all the tasks have automatic grader there is a couple of interesting tasks to docons the material is mostly lectures and there is even a video where lecturer just reads the article from wiki splay tree  has the same information with same lack of some proofs expected add quizzes as it was in the first course the course has less weeks  only  as comparing to  in at so various important data structures are not discussed the course has less homework   tasks each week as comparing to  in at and all  are usually just implementations of some basic algos seen in lecturesi consider the course valuable due to a number of good videos and a couple of good tasks to do but in general this course has the area for improvement	2
this was not really a course but a person talking in front of camera some jibber jabber and not much to learn from these talks at all if this was a way for kimberley to increase her brand presence it did not go well talks were short with no real matter in them fill with jokes just to make time with them i am sorry i did wait until the last lecture hoping that something will come out of it	0
amazing course it really gives your mind something to work	4
interesting course i liked that each session was short so i could fit them into breaks in my day i also liked that the professor used movies to demonstrate concepts he was discussing	3
i felt like this course of the specialization wasnt as organized first of all the object oriented class had no practical assignment and while others did they werent contributing for the learning i passed all the assignments but dont think ive mastered material here as much as in the previous courses of the specializationit seems to me that material could be broken up into two courses and because its squeezed in one the instructors have to provide  of the assignment and finishing the rest  is not helping in learning would be much better to be required to do more work in the assignments possibly step by step and by splitting the course	2
very useful  helped me in my learning for real	4
really frustrating method of teaching class is incredibly slow and does way way too much simple addition subtraction and multiplication to prove extremely basic points for a calculus course	0
it was a fantastic experience	4
great basic overview	2
i had a hard time finding material to studyi wish the class had more reading material	2
i have sat through  of the lessons and i am not very impressed i fell that the topic is very interesting but the professor does not do a very good job explaining the algorithms it may be because i do no have the textbook but overall a rather poor course there need to be a little more explanation beyond the slides	0
teaching and lectures are complicated would be better if more simple language and examples were used	2
great course and great teacher compliments	4
really just an intro but seems like a good one i feel prepared to dive to the next level	3
uva and darden are the best uva and darden are not ranked as the top pubic university and best public business school in the world by several major publications for nothing ive even studied at harvard and uva is way better imo plus a nicer campus	4
too prescriptive and prone to lists do these  things when editing a novel if thats what i was looking for i could search the web for blogs maybe this was too beginner focused for me but im not sure i learned anything really useful here	1
this course proved to be a waste of time there was nothing about the structure and forms of the strong quartet just heres a good one to listen to almost complete devoid of intellectual content	0
html and css parts of the course are not the best but the javascript part is the best you can find on vanilla javascript on coursera	3
the course was ported to the new coursera platform in a amateurish way without any testing learners have been complaining on the forums for months about bugs and missing information in the assessments and they are still not fixed the content is generally interesting but not presented in a cohesive way many concepts are juggled with without giving clear mathematical definitions	1
interesting course not sure it really covers functional programming design it feels more of a brief introduction the material is clearly a cut  paste from a different and i guess longer course there were references to nonexisting weeks and to subjects that were not part of this course that felt a bit cheap considering that courses are not really free anymore positive experience but not exceptional	2
i do not like how the lecturer teaches it is too theoretical and from very simple concepts makes rocket science it would be better to have more exmaple and less theory	1
this course is about computational neuroscience it is not easy and it requires knowledge and passion of mathematics and biophysics of neurons if you are just interested in neuroscience but it is not your specialty like me a medical student then this course is not beneficial for youprof segev is so knowledgeable and i think he tried his best to make easier but as i said it is difficult if you are just interested	2
useful lessons about how to learn the way learning should be playful using several sensesvery recommended	4
a very comprehensive course for coding beginners	3
very structured and organize course  you will have a great time learning with nick santos 	4
course is overwhelming how can you put a  minute video for a class can you divide it or make it simpler tutor is not explaning he only reads he reads sort of teleprompter and thats it boring very disappointed and this is not my first course in coursera i feel im about to quit and this is the second week	0
great introduction into coaching as a manager however it left me wishing the course had more to it and that it lasted longer	3
the class was absolutely wonderful however i dont have the time to go at a students pace work  hom life in general i was trying to go back and finish week  video  but was unable to open the course i want to llearn i wasnt aware there was a time limit to learn happiness 	2
good overview of the eu but you cannot do the quizzes unless you pay	1
its a great course gives you a detailed explanation on what is cloud computing and the different types of various services and its current usage in the marketi would recommend this course to all the people who want a vivid clarity on what is cloud and bigdata	3
excellent course well structured with easy to follow explanations and very relevant to anyone at any stage in life highly recommended thanks for the effort in putting it together	4
ive already written a review but it seems to have been removedthis is an awful course there is very little purpose to it whatsoever it is basically a module in markdown which will in all honesty not have much application for most learnersin addition the course is not at all balanced  laid out well there is a peer assignment in week  which you need to have covered week s content forlastly the recording quality of some of the lectures is awful it is clear that they have simply used some recordings of an actual classroom session of a related course instead of recording for courserain all honesty this entire specialisation is of awful quality it is not a data science course it is a heres a few useful things in r course and the instructors should be ashamed that their institution makes money from it	0
i have submitted all my solution long back but the last submission which was suppose to been by mentor is pending from one and the half months	0
very basic course with an extremely limited view on what makes a good plot	1
very good couse to keep me update	4
the content is very good but the lecture presentation and structure could use improvement assignment instructions are not as clear as they could be	1
very informative however a bit too detailed on the history of previous search engines and past google updates couldve done with a bit less history and more up to date information	2
this class was so boring i could not stand it social media marketing is such a fun  interesting subject that i could not believe they could make it so dull disappointed	1
i am learning a lot but i can not afford to pay	1
although the exercises were challenging at times i realized during the final that prof kauls lectures and the coursework had done an excellent job of helping me understand the various concepts prof kauls manner is although it sounds odd to say about a computerlearning platform extremely personable and understanding  i look forward to taking more courses led by him	4
i highly recommend this course because of its applicable use of r programming i had no knowledge of r but was able to pick it up quickly because the professor made it applicable to real life scenarios my only negative was that it was too short of a course i hope the team at essec considers making a intermediate course to continue on with this training	3
unfortunately didnt enjoy this course at all i have gone through  courses on coursera and finished them with the biggest pleasure and great results this time i had to leave the course before finishing becausest content is organized awfully for example html overview  i knew all the material so i have an idea how it should look like but lecturer started from the middle of all concepts than moved to the beginning and together it looked like an unlinked content i have simply lost a logic inside thisnd very difficult to get an idea lecturer doesnt try to simplify the content even opposite  i had a feeling that he makes easy things complicated for a reason my husbend is a programmer with  years experience and when he watched the lecture he said that even for him it was difficult to understand all the thing things he actually knows all these terms used no relevant examples too complex words and so on  i lost concentration i had to google a lot of unknown terms i had to stop lecture every  seconds to reread or repeat the peace of lecture because i could not understand it as i mentioned i know html well but it was described so complex that it was difficult to link my actual knowledge to lecturer wordsrd not international student friendly use of complex words in places where they were not necessary complex structures too fast language i am pretty good in english but had to stop video and to google translate some smart words lecturer used without particular need  i dont mean definitions just some epithets to make his speech smarter i completed coursera specialization by michigan university and it was completely easy with plain text short sentences so well made for international studentth this is boring i am sorry but this is true i am interested in all these questions but for some reasons i lose my attention every time maybe the reason is in all points i have just mentioned but i didnt enjoy this course at all and it was the first time i didnt enjoy something connected with web app development please dont be mad at me  lecturer is a very charming and charismatic person but i simply dont like how the material is presentedth i have a feeling like all slides are taken from some scientific books and lecturer reads comments from some science articles it is not like described with own words simplified for better comprehension cleared with own reallife examples and in atmosphere of friendly conversation with some emotions and humorplease take my feedback just as my personal opinion and hope other students will enjoy it more	1
the professors and the lectures were excellent homeworks are way to easy would like to use open source tools like pandas and scikit learn instead of proprietary tools like graphlab	2
very informative and explained in a simple understandable manner	3
seems to me the professor needs to study evolution a bit more or change his language a bit for example he said evolution happens for a reason i know what he meant that the success of the organism is served by the results of gene mutation  but evolution is a random event the success of an organism depends on its survival in the habitat etc but it does not depend on the mutation itself the mutation confers a fighting advantage perhaps but it has no will of its own there were many times the professor seems to be saying that evolution is somehow willful i direct him to read richard dawkins on this subject i had to read it twice before i got this point  we are inclined to believe that evolution is a lot like us  driven by some purpose  but alas no	1
good course more problems sets would have been great	3
the material gets progressively tougher but i never felt totally overwhelmed my only feedback is for the mentors to be more responsive in the forums  if were posting it means weve already thrown everything at the question and still couldnt figure it out	3
very clear introduction to calculus good value	4
this course is very good at explaining both how and why you would do things a certain way in unity something that is missing from most of the tutorials you can find out on the internet the professor explains concepts behind why you need to use certain components instead of just giving a list of things to match up to replicate the projects ive rated it  out of  stars not based on the content but because the response time interaction and feedback could be improved upon the content is definitely  of  i took this during the first run of the course so im sure that the course staff will improve on this in the future once they get a bit more used to running a mooc on coursera	3
great course thankyou	4
i think this course could be integrated into the other ones of the specialization or if it is meant to be just a course to get an overview be free of charge	2
one of the greatest things i have go through	4
enriching wide reaching in scope the prof al filreis lets ideas not necessarily his own in for debate and comment the tas are simply brilliant both in form and content bravo	4
i think the classes and the exercises could be far more dynamic and didactic but besides of that is a good course to get a grip of bootstrap if you follow along writing the code and if you tinker a little by yourself afterwards but its definitely for people with solid js and css bases	2
this should be a five star course it is a great topic with wonderful clips from movies and is wellwrittenwhy only  stars thenfor a class about film little was adopted from good storytelling and filming techniques the prof slumped in his chair and clasped his hands in front of his chest for most of the course and spoke in a wispy pedantic voice that made me uncomfortable in my body to listen to i kept on wanting to tell him to sit up and breath and speak naturally on top of that the sound quality was simply awfulif the prof were to take some acting or presenting lessons and improvements to the sound quality were made or a professional actor hired to present the material it could be one of the best courses ever but instead it was hard to get through for me even though the material fascinates me as im learning neuroscience and love moviesthe world of moocs are different than your old standard classroom style visual and auditory presentation really counts	2
really poor powerpoint presentations and videos half in chinese the accent of the teacher is horrible im not an englishnative speaking person so its hard for me to follow english when badly spoken so i cut off the sound and only read the subtitlesthe content is interesting though	0
it is quite interesting but overall not very content heavy it is a bit too much workshop style and lacking a bit the academic structure and content	2
awesome stuff useful things covered but the student should be able to be tested in creating himself code not just run or simple edit the existing code	2
great course assignments are the best part of the course	2
i was able to follow the course and keep the pace but i got lost on factorial anova the professor is great but the course feels rushed through it would be great if more time was spent on actual explanation of main concepts since many here are the beginners in stats i will try again hopefully will get it this time	2
i thought most of the discussions were ____ needs to do this _____ needs to learn to do this yet doesnt provide a lot of concrete answers that helpful to solve x and i understand some situations are complex with a lot of variables but it seems as though a lot of environmental proponents just talk about stuff and dont give examples of what they are doing to change the world i think jadav payeng the forest man of india has done more for the environment than all the attendees at all of these environmental conferences do courses like these highlight all the problems and there are a fuck ton of problems but contain fewer answers so it just leaves the graduate overwhelmed and kind of spinning in a circle i think id rather have a course that asks why do we wear what we do when its made on the other side of the globe is that the best for the environment we need to wholesale changes in how we think about our society if we want it to be sustainable not we have problems over here and here and here and if we put this bandaid on it that might fix it for a while i was just very unimpressed and skipped through the program as quickly as i could rant	1
the way the content is delivered is not interesting and the lecturer basically is reading from the power point	1
thanks	3
it has nothing to do with widening network it is completely misleading this is just a very short course about office etiquette thats iti was very much looking forward to this course sadly i got very disappointed	0
this is a pretty good intro to excel course it gets a little patchy in weeks  and  it seems like some of the worksheets werent checked for errors but it never wastes your time its a great way to get an initial feel for how to do commonlyused professional functions in excel im glad i took it though i do wish there had been more of a progression for example it would have been nice if there was a final project due at the end that put together a lot more of what was covered rather than just reviewing the few functions learned in week 	3
i found the course very interesting the weekly assignments were a great challenge but lacked reference to some reading on the subjectwhen i went quiz ive found that most of the questions had to do with concepts that werent covered in the videos i think that this courser should have further readings about these concepts	3
i will definitely recommend this course not only to those interested in graphic design but also to those who have to make simple power point presentations you will find the tips very useful	4
i dont want to do the exercise	3
maybe i am already somehow experienced but i think that the time i spent on that was a waste 	1
not really good translation in the subtitles	1
the course has fun illustrations and a high quality of production but the lessons themselves dont dive very deep ideas are introduced but not considered in depth one such example is variance we get the equations but not much insight into what it is a measure of and its value additionally and this might just be me but the experiments used to illustrate examples at times are difficult to understand	2
i really like the visiting writer seminars  they were the best part	2
the assignment doesnt correspond with the content of classes closely	2
suitable neither for absolute beginners nor as a standalone course for example there are things that the quiz questions refer to that havent been covered in the course but you cant even look them up because they havent given you the necessary terminology to find relevant information about them on google this means that youll be left looking through a minefield of resources that include the code in the quiz question but are actually about something elsei have now started using lynda instead and am seeing all the bad habits ive picked up and the holes left in my knowledge normally i prefer lynda to coursera for the assignments and the quizzes but not in this case	1
highly addictive course i find myself quoting random tidbits that i learned to complete strangers i dont even have a dog i recommend this to anyone who is an animal lover interested in cognition and learning orju	4
an absolutely great course	4
this course is totally illuminating great backgrounder for a knowledge seeker about terrorism like me it became more significant  engaging because of the great materials  great facilitator  professor edwin bakker	4
a great idea to create a project based online course we should focus on application based learning not on lectures you need improve this course still  weeks are to shortwe need more deep and more weeks	2
thanks for overview of experimental methods and references to relevant articlescomplete the essay quizzes looks like a joke	3
nice course learnt a lot on topic eye opening	3
the class is getting stale the instructors didnt respond to questions on the discussion forums about quiz items the majority of assessment items seem to be available on google and  of the peer reviewed assessment i checked used plagiarized solutions	1
im a statistician not a programmer there is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms when trying to fumble my way through the code i found on several occasions the code in the selfdirected lessons to be incomplete im referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there but were missing causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil i feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code similar to the st course rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming languageif you are a software designerengineer or programmer then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given there are other mistakes within the quizzes as well which make them near impossible to pass for example it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot on other occasions the question actually specifies to use the model from  whereas it actually wants you to use the model from  instead to get the correct answer this course needs to have better quality checks to ensure needlessly lost time is minimized	1
i truly enjoyed this course its case study approach and its hands on learning activities i expect to continue this spec	4
short and very understandable lectures very interesting topic and the professor is very good and a master on this topic no need for background on neuroscience since the professor explains everything very well	4
these were very short lectures without a lot of content for example the different kinds of publishing were described but no time was spent on how to evaluate publishers or how to decide what might work best for the author the interviews with the published authors was by far the best part of this class and i enjoyed listening to them describe their writing lives	1
nice lectures with lot of good information awc setup instruction need to update according new awc interface	2
warning the lecture videos along will not be enough to prepare you for the final assignment be prepared to do your own research for the extra study materials on the forum many students said they had to drop out during the last week probably without getting a refund because they were completely caught off guard by the huge knowledge gap between lectures and the final assignment if you are determined to get the specialization certificate you should definitely start the final assignment as early as possible dont wait until the last week or two	0
there are no advanced stuff these what is taught are basics any graduate or undergraduate student can easily pickup on his her own interest what a waste of time 	1
the quality of the course is not as i expected from a coursera course	1
the course really covered information i knew but made simple concepts complex  that is just my opinion	1
simple and easy tips and a very short course thanks to the teacher the university and coursera for this course	3
not very like this course especially those videos are introduced by female speakerwe dont have this kind of software cant understand and practice it	1
very well organized  stars to both the teacher and the subjects	4
good course found it simple and easy to understand very practical tips and advice thanks	3
the peer reviewed assignments are next to useless as there is no oversight on them i think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first before allowing fellow learners the ability to passfail students in the course	0
i like this kind of class it makes calculus attractive charmin	4
you cannot even complete the first quiz before they demand your p	0
i would have given just one star except the swirl assignments are actually very good the videos are just a poorly narrated glossary topics i learned in another course were presented here in such i way i actually got confused can you imagine my knowledge was actually worsened not improved by thus course   if the swirl functions were made the centerpiece of the course and the videos were described as just a narrated glossary at least our expectations would be in line with reality  even so i come to coursera because i want to be taught by an instructor if id wanted a curated list of tutorials so i could teach myself i would have done that already anyone who pays for this should get their money back not recommended for beginners  i going to complete it because im stubborn that way but it is an unpleasant experience for me and everyone within earshot as i have to vent my frustration often just to make it through  after week  i resorted to just reading the pdf of the slides and stopped watching the videos the videos added nothing to my understanding more often than not they put me to sleep and whats worse the narrator mispronounces attribute there is a difference i attribute certain attributes to native speakers who mispronounce important vocabulary	1
a well thought out course that was very illuminating not sure about the complexity of week s assignment but overall good value	3
kind of boring and i am not learning how half this info is obtained or why it is relevant to real world chemistry	2
this very interesting useful and inspiring course i am enjoying it very much thank you	3
too much theory and not nearly enough practical models that i can use in my life or work disappointed so much of the class was spent on describing many different models instead of focusing on ones that can be applied readily	0
material is explained well and the comprehension checks along the way are helpful	3
the course provides a good framework to deal with business problems it is very simple but effective	3
the course is poorly organised there is a project on week one that requires knowledges of week two some concepts are dictated more than once because it uses videos made for this course  other recorded from a class roomi think this course should be a  weeks project and the price should be the half of it costthough i enjoyed the second project	1
dry principles without real life examples and exercises you can passed the quiz by just reading online or have basic project management experience disappointed	1
this is course is actually informational and interestingthnak you	3
goes waaaay too fast to actually learn anything not very useful	0
lovable instructor very informative one of my favorite courses	4
loved it	4
in just the first  weeks i found several quiz questions that are not correct example code in quizzes is not complete spacing and indentation are incorrect in quiz samplesi realize this is probably to prevent copy paste testing of code but you cannot answer is this code correct if you dont know where they wanted indentation to line up lecture presentation is not very engaging almost seems like the female instructor was forced to stand in front of a camera and read note cards withdrew early	0
a very useful course 	4
i feel that getting and cleaning data course is highly important to know since this is where  of the work in data science is being done	4
i think there is need to provide clearer instructions on how to get the programming assignments done the course content is good but doing the programming assignments needs to be more clarified	2
in my point of view the course overall is a bit superficial even though the decisionmaking part was very interesting indeed more importantly the course lacks one of the richest tools in moocs peer interactions  people voicing their opinions and sharing experiencesbesides that some of the questions in the quiz looked very ambiguous and there are some editing mistakes in the videos	1
it is so basic and simple	0
very very very easy	2
very simple and basic ideas of growing a business case studies are a little bit outdated	2
this course does not go indepth into the selected management topics selected i used it as a benchmark to make sure i am taking into account the most important  basic tools of management science	3
no mouse to highlight on slide when teachingits a lot of unclear parts in slidei think cs is better	1
loved most of the information totally loved the recipes and really hope that my grandchildren will	3
week  application assignment is buggy if you input correct answers they will be marked as incorrect you must use trial and error to find the wrong answers the quiz is looking for its a badly designed assignment that wastes students time and creates a lot of frustration would not recommend the course because of it	0
great course with interesting contents and new approaches to be used in our daily life understanding constellations is much beyond the standard carrot and stick policy making organisations more stablethanks guido and ulrich for your time and commitment to this course	4
the course itself was great the only thing lacking is that all the assignments were reviewed only by peers	3
it could have been better if notesslides were provided	3
good overview of araf	2
a lot of calculation errors and incorrect answers	1
not very well organized course to teach the essential principles of negotiation the course material moves incongruently between legal and business negotiation tactics which would make it difficult for any untrained future negotiator to understand the art of negotiation and adr for business and law	0
a good introduction though i would have appreciated more readings or suggestions on where to look into the topics in more depth particularly the financial services metrics it was disorienting to not use actual data sets in the final peer assessment	3
well constructed course that should lead the learner towards developing a policy position that will be characterized by rigor and coherence professor griffiths is the star of this course with a particular teaching style that conveys often complex ideas in a clear and forthright manner highly recommended	3
good coursenext step to get specialization in scala and fpmany thanks pavel	3
a bit confusing in term of structure we jumped from some sections of the project life cycle to others missing some others it gave a good general picture of what project management is about but im not quite sure which is the order i should follow when dealing with a project however i have to say i didnt do the optional readings at least not yetanyway i think is an overall good course for not initiated people like me	2
the peerreview assignment is not properly designed from my own experience colleagues tend to underestimate other peoples projects in addition the peerreview had an extraoptional advanced component analysing criminal patterns for a second city comparing patterns across two cities which i carried out but got no extra credit for the extra work was not even part of the assignment classification  there should be a bonus question for students who carry out the advanced part of the assignment	2
it is odd that a course that concentrates so vehemently on speech tone as a segue to music would be taught by a monotone and mostly unenthused professor often verbose but never succinct i had to listen to his drone twice to glean anything of valuehis tests were wrought with gotcha questions having nothing to do with the important material of the course as a physicist i was very disappointed in his treatment of the important equations associated with the mathematics of music mentioned as too hard to understandthere was nearly no mention of rhythm and its importance in music as relates to biology andor emotion and no mention of how those rhythms relate to heartbeati am deeply disappointed but i do hope this critique is seen as an opportunity to create a better course	1
just as good as part  neat old professor a bit more abstract than 	3
a totally new insights to security since i am a software engineer student this concepts are going to prove invaluable in my future tasks great tutor and coursera support love it	3
good one	4
great course i had ever learned	4
this is an excellent course its very thoughtprovoking and provides insight into meditationa subject that eludes many people the course needs more quizzes to help students learn and remember the knowledge taught in the lectures it also needs a better evaluation schemethe two essayonly evaluation form does not do enough to test student knowledge test are needed a better evaluation scheme would weigh testing and essays for example  testing  essay	3
certain aspects of the course could be improved particularly in the way the material is presented there could also be more focus on what is important rather than unnecessary etymologies and listing of names which doesnt add to any conceptual understanding that time could rather be used to go into more depth with some of the practiceshttpsevidenceandreasonwordpresscomreviewmagicinthemiddleages	2
heavy contents unable to cover a weeks material in a week	0
very basic if one has already worked with software before	2
i had rated the course earlier but would like to amend my statement by some uncanny chance i have just managed to pass the final assignment on my fourth try which means i have passed my course i still believe my original observations are valid thank you	2
videos are poorly edited too much blank space the bullet points are not clearly visible there is no narrative or discursive structure the diagrams are not clear and the interviews are raw and unedited sessions are too long and include too much irrelevant information the little useful information there is is not structured clearly and thus its harder to learn the material for the first  weeks resemble more to someone talking about the good ol days rather than a properly thoughtout history class i had to leave the course as i found it to be a waste of my time and i am glad i decided not to pay for a certificate for it my expectations were a lot higher for a university course	0
it would be nice to see more detailed explanation instead of reading the lines in slides also there is less practical content for real time usage	0
this is a great course for leading the development team but its very theoreticalit is better to add videos from realworld meetings	3
one of the best course i have taken in coursera very well structured the professor makes every concept looks really simple the assignments are the best part they give us the confidence you need to start designing your own responsive frontend web application from scratch the level is suitable for beginner and midlevel	4
there is not much of a relation between what the course gives explains with the videos and with the swirl exercises and the real exercices they ask to too difficult to follow by people new in the programming area	1
my course  in this specialization is still incomplete because the questions had wrong answers in the module quizzes and it was literally taking hours to complete the quizzes because you had to guess which one of the wrong answers would be correct this time the questions rotate through slightly different questions each attempt so you cant simply use elimination on each attempt you guess every single time its literally  luck i thought maybe course  would be better but nope same problems here ive wasted over  hours in total trying to pass these broken tests and im completely over it i also reached out to chat support they went through and said they couldnt find anything wrong and couldnt help me and a refund was impossible because its past the refund date even though i paid for  broken unproofread time wasting courses also in course  the math tables in the videos are staggered all over the place and looks terrible seriously an issue of someone not even looking at the video before publishing would have taken less than  mins to fix for the entire course also every time a checkpoint question is supposed to pop up nothing happens in every single video theyre all missing ive used coursera for a few other courses and thought they were reliable but this makes me think otherwise and i feel like such an idiot for paying  for this complete garbage other people in the forums have shown they have the same problem posted over a month ago but nothing please someone from coursera get a hold of me and help me resolve this ridiculous problem	0
awesome introduction course	4
i was a bit dubious about the course to start with and thought it might be too easy too full of common sense but in the second week i felt i was learning things and boosting my ability to learn and focus which is so important today im considering further study to help me find interesting work so this course has really helped to get me on the right track to study again with a bit more confidence and method thank you	3
this course was very boring and very frustrating long long slow lectures with lots and lots and lots of questions and no answers the briefest of comments on potentially interesting people or topics but no links to enable those to be followed up quizzes on concepts not covered in the material conflicting descriptions of assessment requirements discussion moderators who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for before taking this course i could find only one negative review which i dismissed as probably being a minority having taken the course i agree with that review wholeheartedly i did learn a couple of things despite everything but i would not recommend this course please upgrade it substantially	0
quality and length of material is mediocre	0
absolutely poor avoid no professor monitoring of the fo	0
a bit too much useless mumbo jumbo that can be concluded in a few sentences good for those that are new to videomaking and good for some classic movies mentioned in the course	2
contains all basic information on data descriptors presented in a thorough and easy to understand way more practice exercises quizzes would make it even better	3
the course is good i already use bootstrap and still finding useful information here but the sound is too silent also teacher speaks too slow it makes listening even more difficult	2
thi course covers up the basics of networking and security for ios applications using objectivec its a great course if you want to understand the basics and want to implement in practice some of these topics i just wish it cover more cases and more apps but for that this should be a course more longer than it is nevertheless its a great course	3
i have no idea why you called it course since there was nothing inside	0
a wow even though i went through formal project management training this is so simple and straightforward	4
the final project gives a deeper insight and understanding of how to apply the strategists toolkits in creating valuable competitive position for an organization great professors	3
too many theory and reading from lecture slides it would be way much better if some examples were included quizzes could include some more questions too	1
whether student or teacher this course is a must full of easy to learn valuable insights that will save you time and energy throughout your life i would have loved to have known this earlier as its applications are useful for both the full time and casual learner	4
i was expecting to solve problems using more opensourced package unfortunately i feel this series of courses are more of an advertisement for the instructors software company	0
very basic	0
was a great experience	4
very interesting i liked all the classes and exercises	4
i was not aible to complete this course for free that was very disappointing universities like stanford and john hopkins find the opportunity to offer similar courses free of charge to peoople who want to learn from university of washington i have expected the same your badbest regardskonstantin	0
an easy one	1
too philosophical	1
the course is absolutely amazing great insights	4
i need to have a class i really think this course could hel me a lot	2
ive taken this course for a while but prefered to stop as i found it very not academic in terms of ethics and objectivity it spreads anxiety and takes too much liberty with history	0
very informative but at times too technical	2
very methodical approach learning python excellent book and video	4
the content from this course is already out of date for meteorjs and links are broken	1
very good i suggest this course for everyone search about improve reading skill and english for entrepreneurship	3
they talked a little about ldl and hdl which is goodbut the rest was just a summary of avoid processed foods eat less and eat less meat and ways to do it it is important but i thought the course lacked science and it was very very short	1
while the course materials themselves were very useful the quizzes didnt feel like an effective test of the material and consisted of very few questions which didnt leave room for error especially problematic because some questions were subjective	2
basic but good knowledge	3
nicely arranged course	4
very basic course it involves a lot of gui concepts which may not be useful for general programmers	2
this is all information i already have in my arsenal after researching health trends and learning more about how i should eat i was hoping for something a little more detailed	2
a little slower than the last ones not my favorite but great use of handson projects and enagagement	2
pretty great for understanding python basics best way to start your python or programming life b	4
the course content and delivery ha	3
i highly recommend this course the instructor is very eloquent and clear you will gain solid fundamentals in html and css you wont regret to enroll in this course however it is good idea you study by your side git and github to avoid frustrations with that part of the process	4
excellent course highly recommended to take	4
i understood the point that in script writing matters more than theory but i dont think that its right that all marks i got i received from other with me with zero feedback from lectors and teachersdefinitely i wouldnt pay for sertificate but as first step and making some ready draft for further polishing the script this course was enough so from one side it helped me to move forward with my idea but on other hand i didnt get any professional feedback and advices from teacher there were some very useful comments from other students but i also need some help from people who are real professionals in it	2
very interesting and intriguing quizzes are a bit hard because they cover so much material so if you are a working individual i feel its almost impossible to accomplish but its nice for general knowledgetwo notesfirst it would be nice if the professor wouldnt use get yourself comfortable in the beginning of each video  it is a bit annoyingsecond on quizzes  tests its recommended that you omit the sentence in the presentation that starts every questionquizztest because obviously it is based on what we are presented in the videos so its just time consuming in my opinionbesides that great for general knowledge awesome teacher i really enjoyed this course thank you	3
good material fair presentation too many peer evaluations	0
most of the courseslectures seemed to be very basic project management principles some lectures did give a good background and high level understanding of construction project management but expected a bit more in depth infolast lessonassignment required more research on my part as it required general construction knowledge the reason i took to this course was to get a better highlevel understanding of construction project management and planning however the job logic assignment expected that i would know what all is involved in the technical workings in construction ie excavation prepping waterproofing etc in which i have no experience or knowledge a hour assignment took me more than  hours to complete	2
prosbasics were explained wella good kick start for beginners who are travelling towards learning project planning and managementconswish we had assignments to practice ms project to a certain extentsome of the quiz questions were confusing esp the rd week quiz	2
the contains of the course is not really enough for improve the writing skill for scientific paper those advices mention in the video is common and thats it no more practice or example to help the learner understand or apply that concept to their writing	1
easiest accounting common sense if you ever took acct  this will be a wasting of time	0
the content was very scarce and it was obvously prepared in a hurry this course just touches very superficially the subject to be studied not meeting minimum quality standards	0
this course has great potential as it is an extraordinarily timely topic domestically and globally the accessible required reading assignments were thought provoking and topical also one of the required videos proved helpful and a couple of the optional ted talks were must sees for anyone involved in the nonprofit sectorit was problematic that there was so little direction with respect to how one might access the required reading materials that were not linked into the course syllabus in fact one of the links provided simply directed the learners to a youtube video extolling the virtues of the book wherein the required chapter was located another blatant colleague marketing technique occurred during the course of one of the required videos wherein the organizer interviewed an author about his book there was some helpful substantive information that came out of that interview but for the most part i felt as though i was watching an infomercial requests for help fell on deaf ears except for those of colearnersa small but annoying flaw was that the professors were simply reading text from their slides for the video component of the coursewith an additional word thrown in on occasion for good measure it would have been less distracting just to have the slides to readi wish this course had been designed and taught to the standards i have come to expect from coursera courses it could have been one of the most valuable yet	1
one of the best introductory ml courses	4
great overview but pretty challenging for those without any programming experience	3
i liked pretty this course i learnt some useful skills and tactics in order to develop a negotiation as a negative point i found lack of examples so that understand better the theoretical issues as well as to remember better	2
solid course correct doses of theoretical and practical knowledge to get started with ios development	4
doesnt worth the effort you learn the most by searching online tools each time you encounter a problem while solving a quiz problem or following the steps the instructor did	0
terrible lecture videos with many typos absence of lecture notes absence of course staff on a discussion forum maybe suitable for those who is alredy a scientist and just need to get some general sence of data science	0
as a novice in photography this course taught me the necessary basics when you are starting out to become a photographer videos about content and composition of the photo are extremely helpful	3
good intro  im learning a lot but in the end i feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces one portfolio piece at the end of an month course does not seem adequate to me so i wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work  in addition to the needfinding user research sketches short weekly assignments this high fidelity digital work could even be optional but i need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should lookor even being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first  sections would be helpful	2
i was expecting something more in depth for methods and functions on swift	2
this course doesnt contain any new information it does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known factsthere are better ways to invest your time	0
nice and comprehensive information from all the fieldsa real world wide problemwe are looking forward for even more uptodate information and data and more in depth information when they are readily available either as in video information or as text links	4
i was expecting more modules on configuration management like deployment manager service	2
easiness and difficult level are great for beginners and people with tight schedules	3
the video lectures are really boring and useless	1
dearth of any specific  practical tools	0
the course tackles an interesting topic why do we enjoy musicbut there are two problems with this course it fails to provide convincing evidence for its claims the evidence is circumstantial and flimsy the lecturer is how shall i say this politely monotonic he lacks enthusiasmmy recommendation if you are interested in the topic take this course and make your own mind up maybe it will convince you if not you will have learnt a bit about human perception a sound perception	1
really enjoy it thanks a lot	4
very good start for ios developers	3
i found this a really interesting course to complete the lectures are easily digestible and help to provide context for various readings that you complete along the way i would have liked an introductory lecture that gave an overview of some of the major themes of the course more clearly i felt a bit at sea throughout the first topic having never studied this before i didnt know what to pay attention to but once we were underway i had no trouble working out the flow of events i really enjoyed this thank you	3
very helpful for guide fresh s	4
content is good but more is there in presentation that we have to self read it would be better if somebody explains in video because reading we can do ourself and lots of content are available freely but we spend money so that somebody teaches us those things	2
the soul beliefs course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias if the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down they partially succeeded most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weaka better title for the course would be why there is no soul that way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda	0
the course is rather interesting however it is worth mentioning that the course is very initial introduction without detailed materials in the topic	3
very thorough walks you step by step but a little too slow and detailed for someone with minimal coding background	2
overall it is ok but the example framework is more like created for teach purpose which is not practical in industry moreover it seems there are many incorrect part in the assignment especially optional code assignments	2
i think the content itself is somewhat too theoretical it does not usually apply to the reality	1
a very good introduction to major branches of philosophy while some questions on assignments were rather vague and some lectures rather dull i dont think i bothered watching the videos from the third week on just relied on the excellently put together handouts overall a great course to take for a beginner to the world of philosophy d	3
very clear and ussefull thanks	3
the videos and key notes seem to be not in snc when it comes to some points 	3
this is not a beginners course unless you already have previous programming experience the python lessons are just samples taken from a completely different curriculum on codecademy and poorly integrated into the biocentric course content the lessons are disjointed taken out of context and some of the examples are using the wrong version of python and missing parentheses it would be a lot better if they took the time to actually craft custom python lessons designed specifically for this course instead of using illfitting lessons from other classes	2
the course focused so much in interacting with images instead of the html css and js subjects	1
a nice idea but very poorly done this would be cool topic to learn about but it is just so poorly executedweek  was just introduction week  seemed okay reasonably interesting with a video that although was somewhat dated in style managed to grab my attention for the  or so minutes in lengthhowever week  is where i get off a  minute video of slides with only a couple of minutes of narration in total with what seems like about  links to random articles over the internet links to articles to read would be fine if done well but with very little to join them up and link them back to the subject at hand is a bit boring also the worst part  the slides arent posted so in order to get to these articles i had to pause the video and letter by letter type them into the address bar i gave up after the third article and hit leave course	0
when i took assignments  and  were broken and there were no mentors to help students however i am now told they will be fixing the course i give  stars becuase the concepts of the assignments is good but the course needs more attention	1
i did not meet my expectations from the course	1
it wasnt structured that well plus most of had to make a digital marketing report for the first time without even a sample of how industry experts expect to see when they look ata repot	2
i have a negative opinion of the structure of this course it is not laid out in a format that i a native english speaker understood the interviews and recorded lectures were not adequate or sufficiently rehearsed the gentleman that drills his own cavities in his home workshop was most annoying and pointless looked at the ceiling buddha  of his screen timethe reading was too disjointed and the book on mindfulness is really more commercial and repetitious that one would expect of a course in coursera professor wright is too laconic phlegmatic and unengaging i wrote the assignment for week three but there were no instructions on how to convert a document in textedit mac wp to the course submission page so that was a total crash for me i would never recommend this course to anyone	0
prossome useful terminology if you want to ever communicate with someone who does recommender systemsconsvery diluted contentmostly large text slides with the presenter talking in a monotone voiceprogramming exercises are done in java and require deploying an ide  an unused open source project developed by the authors hint to the authors use python r or octave like everyone doessome of the questionaries are ambiguous	2
thank you for putting this course together i found it is extremely useful to understand buddhism especially selflessness with psychology knowledge it gives the buddhist philosophy a scientific foundation it also helped my mindfulness meditation journey gave me much clearer picture on what to watch during the meditation journey i recommend this course to anyone whos interested in buddhism mindfulness and meditation	4
fairly poor level of detail  you feel like you end up just learning terms without really getting a proper test on the understanding behind it	1
course was the worst i have taken on coursera i wish i could have received a refund the professors were hard to follow laughed through mistakes and did not do a good job of walking through the course content i would not recommend this course to anyone	0
no content essentially you just read a textbook the videos are about  minutes per week	0
i really enjoyed the content presented	4
presentation is so boring and dry i could not bring myself to watching past the first couple of videos	0
the material is well explained but there is not much of it it is very very basic the tasks being extremely easy dont really bring you further in understanding either	2
videos from previuos version of the course reactive programming in scala makes this course worse prepared i had impression that it was made rushed from shredded pieces assignements are easier than previous	2
very good course overall would recommend to every game developer and game designer	3
not very great examples provided but you certainly can still learn a lot also i disagree with using visjs its a lousy library	3
the curse is good but for me it only worked when i started some other larger courses of each topic separately i mean this works as a short overview of everythig but otherwise it jumps too quickly from a languaje to the next	3
i already feel like a web developer all thanks to yaakov chaikin its been a wonderful and exciting course	3
its to general i would like to have done some exercises great framework without a punchline	1
very in depth course covering many important parts of the industry the professor is an actual lawyer in this field theres lots of material in this course and while many topics are dry by nature the professor manages to keep it interesting	4
covers only the very basics for project management	1
lectures are too complicated i understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product	2
a good course however i would expect more coherence between the different modules discussed in its current structure the course represents a glance at an arbitrary selection of several topics unrelated to e existing in todays philosophy rather than a coherent introduction into the broad discipline of philosophy however this may be just a matter of approach  this approach is also perfectly valid	2
the theories are perfect but a little simple for those who have already known them	2
very interesting with some great	3
although the information on the course states that it requires no prior programming knowledge that statement isnt accurate you will quickly become lost in the assignments and questions as they are a not a logical progression from the lecture material the instruction from mr peng is all over the place and doesnt give you a good understanding of the language i found swirl to be  more helpful but looking at the upcoming materials you need to have a solid background in programming to complete this specialization which should have been told to students prior to them spending money on the course i would not recommend this course to anyone	0
the course is awesome in terms of topics covered but the pace is too fast moreover the lectures are not comprehensive it is needed to put more material or refer some notes or books that might help	2
 in this course using python x the whole course in chinese no english subtitles there are no additional materials or information there is nothing  only the chinese	0
entertaining maths the fun way	4
i dislike whole specializationbecause videos are waste of time they are teaching little things with long videos also i dont easily understand the accent of the speaker	0
awesome very helpful in building concepts in knowledge in big datacloud computing and cdn	3
this was an interesting introduction to water resource management i found it very useful to learn about the institutional regime when having to face a multisectoral problem and the methods to address it i particularly enjoyed the fact that there were numerous case studies discussed such as the nile basin or the mekong basin in order for you to improve the efficacy of this course i would suggest the following measuresa a synopsis of the main laws and directives regarding the protection and management of water resource in the last courseb further analysis on how to deal with certain general problems such as the case when a country upstream pollutes the waters that head to the country downstream that you mentioned in your last video i would like to see more examples of management of such a conflictthank you	3
speak speed is little bit too quick difficult for nonenglish speaking student	2
this is a gigantic waste of time	0
good course for learning the basics of the caret package however it is not a good course for learning machine learning	2
bad explanation and poor introduction	1
very clear and handson course thank you	3
it is very informative and interesting i really like the way you guide us thank you	4
if what you want is the sort of doctrinaire overview of fineart photography that you might have learned in a university in the s this is exactly the course for youits thoroughly saturated with the museum of modern art mindset the assumptions and interpretations are those touted by moma curators and the photographers are chosen from the momaapproved pantheon the quiz questions tend to focus on coursecontent minutiae  which commentator said x about y  to make sure youve drunk your artestablishment koolaidon the other hand if you want to examine the diversity of photography through a variety of critical approaches  marxist feminist queertheory poststructural whatever  well they dont allow none of that there here this is strictly the photography gospel according to moma and you either like it or lump it	0
its okay but paying for a certificate its not worth it	2
very well structured clear explanations and great additional resources to test and repeat the material thank you very much	4
final project almost impossible to do with material taught also each lecture comes with an additional spreadsheet that needs to be studied material taught doesnt match material tested	1
excellent teaching course including managers	4
interesting case studies but very uninteresting professor	2
very bad course too fast is not an introduction more like a remember of things this course try to covers too much information in  weeks and the assigments are not well guided and messy	0
as an educator myself i found this class to be rather pathetic in its structure and the assignments these are topics and activities that i was doing as a student in middle school and junior high both public schools mind you not arts centered charters charging people for a certificate in this class is tantamount to what diploma mills do as the course requirements are not up to even senior high school level coursework truly coursera what happened to your open education offering real education	0
in my opinion this course is a waste of time it simply throws a bunch of links and terminology for you to google and research the project is interesting but once again you have to do tons of research and take up other courses to fill the gaps might as well do the other courses instead of this onei do not recommend this course or the specialization	0
it was a good course even though it was a bit theoretical its a great start for someone who has no background in social norms i am glad i took this course though	3
i have to apologize this course was so out of date yes i learned a few things but the recommended reading was from  and  one of the assignments was about an app that no longer exists had i not already purchased multiple classes i dont think i would continue on i hope the next classes are more uptodate	0
this course was really useful and prof siedel is such a great person it is a pleasure listen to his lectures that were more like stories i however would have liked to have little quizzes in between the weeks to review the content it adds up quite a lot and even taking notes at the end some info gets missing i definitely recommend this course though i am sure i will do much better in my next negotiation	3
great course i definitely enjoyed watching every single video and doing my own side reasearch on things i wanted to learn a little bit more about i did buy the book but that is also something i didnt like about the course it seemed like the courses sole purpose was to get us to buy the book there were so many moments where it would have sufficed to expand or explain something a little further instead of just giving us an inconclusive idea and then tell us to check the book this made it look and feel more like an advertisement for the book but despite all that i learned a lot and it was a great topic and wonderfully prepared you just have to ignore the book deal	3
i did not conclude the course because of the fundamentally wrong guidance that this lecturer promotes today we know more advanced and useful methodologies for entrepreneurship	0
actually i feel like im reading the instruction manual without knowing useful skills	0
the course is perfectly designed	4
very theoretical course they should add some hands on its like mugging things for quiz	1
love the way that you teach it is so inspiringthanks alot	4
i felt that the programming assignments were not explained well enough things like different syntax that wasnt explained and such if the class required a lot of outside research not included in the class they should mention that more clearly	2
my happiness went down after this course only positive thing was that i realized how messed up my life isoverall its a interesting course it is obvious that a lot of effort was made while creating it and you can definitely learn something from it	2
i quit this course as it does not live up to the specialization which it begins javascript is not java the course description should clearly state that javascript will be taught and that it will be used to draw boxes of different colors i was extremely let down by this course	0
excellent course  im glad i paid for the certification too as it helps me commit to the completion of the course the lectures in part i and ii of the course greatly helped me in landing a cool internship in financial engineering in the pricing  development team of societe generale africa technologies and services in casablanca morocco and im currently doing very well at the company	4
ok as intro to chinese language	2
it was helpful to learn a few hacks to make learning a little less painful thank you	3
good project enjoyed playing with the scalaja	3
some parts were very useful some parts looked useful but when i tried it in practice it was almost impossible to do for me the course wants to make you behave like a machine for a part of your job so you have more room in your head to behave the way you want to but behaving like a machine i tried but i can not still there are very usefull parts in this course i did about  of the course	2
it is too basic boring if you have ever programmed before i would enclose the full content of this course into a week as part of the second course	1
the lessons are sometimes completely disconected from the graded assignments there were some graded assignements that dealt with things i have never heard about and i completed it without even looking the lessons videos some of the lessons are disapointing of the lack of assistance to the required softwarecode to be used in such a way that the concept worked is very simple but if you have no experience on the software or code you can have a hard time to complete the assignements with irritating details which are not explained at all in the lessons the lessons serves more as a guide to what you should search in google and learn through other source of information i did not expected such poor course from a paid one i have doen free courses way better than this course dont pay or this course find some other course free or other paid course with better reviews	1
most of it you cant do unless you pay for it  not sure i can even click complete for the course so not really a mooc  no option for collaborationvideos had useful content about  of theweek  resources was by far the best and most useful	0
its rather a course on using api of proprietary software with very very basic background on the actual math underneath	1
this is my first course in coursera i love this course	4
too simple personally feel this can be clubbed with r programming	2
a very great course indeed my sincere congratulations to all people who were able to make it this is the best course have ever donemillions of thanks	3
margaret meloni was constantly looking down to read directly from a poorlyrehearsed script while trying to stumble through phrasing and lecture points considering this is a course about communication this was very disappointing the quizzes were vague and either didnt have clear correct answers or didnt feel applicable to the module to which it was assigned after reviewing the material i had to complete the quizzes by trialanderror since the answers were not reflected in the lectures	0
very open way of learning few talks with people from the industry sharing their approachnot much of fundamental knowledgegenerally great motivator to exercise character design not that great resource to learn from a beginning	2
pretty awesome course everything is crystal clear its fun and simple but it doesnt involve any additional coursework besides exams so theres not much extra learning from peers	3
mo comment went way too fast no contact not deep	0
it is a great course very helpful and you can check that it works by using the techniques they give you totally recommend it	4
this is a fantastic course to get you upto speed on basics of meteor and working with node	4
a little dated with most material and research presented from the glorious days of  the issues at hand are however still valid though	2
i dont want to this course to be over one of the best courses ever	4
it is a good introductory course but it relies too much on networks and could be confusing and demoralizing if you intend to pursue a career in systems biology	1
coding documents and data cleaning is possibly the best thing ever d	4
this is my first course on coursera and im very satisfied i liked the lecturer assignments and tests i want to thank you for this course	4
very useful course im enjoying it a lot 	4
a very interesting course and a good introduction to the topic would be beneficial if one could gain official credits or points towards an online degree with an expandedmore indepth course volume	2
nicely structured and overall a great course sometimes a little slow for my preference	3
i found the course helpful as an older life long learner i have had experience in identifying and modifying bad study habit this course reinforced what i have picked up along the years i applaud the clarity of the short segments of each lesson and think that this course would be extremely helpful for those of us with poor study habits	3
very nice beginner level course and gives you a lot of knowledge	3
it feels like a privilege to hear published recognised authors discuss their work and encourage beginners to w	4
i am disappointed because the course doesnt provide profound material on data analysis with python the videos are too short and the samples demonstrated in the videos arent thoroughly explained for instance the speaker often only says what she is doing but not why she is doing it or what the function of a particular parameter is i felt left alone and forced to google in my opinion it cannot be the purpose to make your student google basic things that could easily be integrated into the courseconsidering that this is labelled as a beginner course i was expecting much more theoretical input other courses offer additional slides and scripts that are aligend with the course videos and allow the students to look things up	0
fun interesting good pacing and case studies instructor was enthusiastic knowledgeable and presented material well	3
very interesting and useful examples thanks a lot to coursera and the instructors dr matthew yeekinganddr mick griersonand computing department goldsmiths university of londonfor their excellent work	4
i was looking for a course that discusses how to think about the data and how to manipulate the data based on the questions you have this course was more basic and didnt really focus on the many ways of visualizing the data to tell a story the course did not discuss the pros and cons of each type of visualization eg pie chart vs line graph vs column chart etc but of course more complex because we are using tableau with the type of question and answers you are looking for this type of content is what i was most interested in	1
this is a lousy coursethe subject and material could be interesting however the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a rubics cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether youve understood the key points of the lectureswhile this course was a timed release implying someone at the u of copenhagen is involved with it week to week it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration the only interaction you seem to have is with other studentsthis has got to be the worst coursera course i have taken and i have taken quite a few	0
excellent course for anyone interested in social innovation and generating novel ideas	4
one of the best courses i took on coursera and the best one for business english learning so far in my opinion the teachers know exactly what the esl student need and put solid business material into it which is really fantasticgreat job this is the best one i could imgaine and that i just want hope more great courses coming up in futurethanks so much and i really enjoy it and would appreciate every effort youve made in this course	4
the fact that the class uses graphlab instead of pandasnumpysklearn should have been stated up frontthe course felt like an advertisement for the professors toolkitit was very disappointing that the equivalent standard workflow was not supported	0
could have been much better should have been a proper video tutorial	0
arguably the worst of the bunch as far as learning anything sigh	1
enjoyable but limited content	1
this course is very helpful all the concepts are clearly explained and most of them are fairly useful	3
lessons are not compatible with tablets	3
thanks for creating short course for busy business pearsonbut it is too gamificate to professional business managers educate in addition this is the lack of contentsfor improvement this course i strongly recommend you to add create presentation and peer review assignments this is the issue of the coursera included other moocs open access education philosophy	0
informative but there were less videos shown specially on real time situations	3
touches all the key concepts of statisticas inference a bit challenging even more if you dont have previous knowledge of statistics	3
excellent  learned a lot great teacher	4
good introduction to database and basic sql	4
i really wouldnt call this a course just an overview of vr  ar technologies and really general principle of work for ar it took be less than an hour to watch everything and pass the tests	0
i am kind of disappointed that you have to pay for the course before you can submit the solution to the problem set however that is not the main issue of this course as i fully understand that the financial profit for the lecturer is very important the main issue of this course is that the chaos in the symbol used in the second programming assignment the lecturer cannot even main selfconsistency in the symbol used the statement of everything in both pa and pa is also very confusing	1
i found there was too much information given in the course lectures without enough practice to learn bit by bit to really understand what i was learning	0
i had reached the last session of this course when it suddenly became impossible to access the video i had to wait several days before this was possible other videos from other sites were ok so must have been local to you and not a fault at my end then when i could access the site again i found i could not reconnect with the course at the level at which i had left it but would have to start again unsurprisingly i did not want to do this but would like to finish what was a very interesting and thought provoking course and the presentation was excellent and deserves  stars the prof is a star i hope you can help in this matter as there does not seem to be anywhere on your site where one has the opportunity to contact coursera with problems such as this as i do not think this review page is truly relevant to the problem but where else can i go please do not suggest the community forumhopefullymary w	2
it was very well designed and organized but some parts were superficial like module  i think it needs more details and explanation	3
great course and great teachermost of the topics covered are described in clear and practical way and the programming exercides help to get a better understandingperfecto to have an initial but solid backgroung abour machine learning	3
this course gives a broad overview of what the internet of things is and the components that comprise iot devices	3
its an extremely basic introduction which doesnt help in much for the next session r programming	1
great training  keep up the good work 	4
first two weeks are too repetitive with other courses	2
very basic information from highschool stem classes	1
much more useful than the first course it was very interesting to see that methodology has a different approaach according to the purpose of the class that is not necessarily communication great experience although i think that the questions for peer revision are so general aand vague that one is almost forced to give a good grade even if the assignment is just a retelling of what was presented on the video sometimes even word by word	3
the course overall is good with plenty of insights into game theory however i wish there could be more concrete examples for concepts such as bayesian equilibrium and core the examples given are too special and is not in accordance with what is given in the exercisethanks for the lecturers and mentors	3
the material and videos are so poor and low quality i am happy to not have bought this course	0
very very bad communication from the teachers the nd mooc was supposed to start i think  months ago it did not start at the time of this reviewthey did not even bother to post some announcement to let the students know  ok course starts in x monthsmaking things worse you cannot get a refund if you purchased the entire thing	0
thoroughly disappointed to see this course based on	0
great course	3
quizzes dont match whats been taught in the video lectures very poorlydesigned questions where there is more than one correct answer	0
great	4
some of the ideas discussed are useful  new to me like linear programming and whatif analysis the content is more suited to this specialization context instead of teaching excel in general so in case you are looking to learn excel this is not a great course i didnt like the quizzes most of the questions added no value my suggestion to the instructors would be less questions on the quizzes and more relevant to what you teach i wouldnt complete the course if it wasnt a part of the specialization that i am attending	1
cool	3
all the basics for beginners some step by step and some things make you think and research more references i think thats a great combination	2
this is not an introduction to r programming this is more indepth than just introduction in week  were asked to compute and program to read multiple files at once with very specific functionalities this is not an introduction to r programming whatsoever also it requires a lot of user reading from other sources ie google stack overflow etc i dont recommend this to newbies	1
great appreciation to professor charles severance and coursera	4
wished the course was a deeper dive into this area	2
nice  but basic	3
hands down the best mooc course ive taken so far charles is not only extremely intelligent and creative when it comes to explaining the content of the course but his sense of humor lightens the load of the class	4
as others have said the first four courses were good  i learned a lot from the videos and materials however the capstone project was a waste of time why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me in addition the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about  of the requirements of this capstone project  the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all this seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses i expected a lot more from a whartonled course  very disappointing	0
a bit outdated now however it is still a good resource to get started	2
we need more clinical dentistry courses	3
professor chuck have continued his brilliant course series right up to the final lecture i thoroughly enjoyed it the lessons and assignments were one of the best thanks for making this journey so incredible on to the capstone now  	4
thank you david it is a wonderful course	4
this course gives great insight to the importance of planning out the various structures of a game before building it the valuable resources such as the readings were also very much helpful the instructor has a calm spirit and his lectures are interesting and easy to understand	4
she can go in depth more and give us more and more information but still i like itthank you coursera	2
very hard to understand	0
great course easy to follow and informative i would love to see a case study to follow through some examples as it would be an interesting way to tie together some information	3
somewhat too simple but still a good basic introduction	2
basic intro to python but i found the content not to systematically organized	2
professors are very good  i am really enjoy in this class but no further discussion about implementing ml algorithm just call the api to handle the sort of data	2
the only one life changing course stars are not enough to rate this need  at least thank you very very very much dr barbara oakley and dr terrence sejnowski	4
i think participation in the forum discussion in this course seems not so active and less of interaction among students if there are some incentives or some grading can be applied to push people to talk more it will be a very good learning experience to all	2
could be more engaging but consists of a whole lot of relative information	3
material was interesting but mentorsteaching assistants and the course director were nonexistent hard to get any significant discussions going	1
it does not fully utilize the power and possibilities of a mooc students cannot study at their own pace there is no live interaction standard quizes and assignments which is a bit ironicpeerreviewing really brings down the quality of the feedback not everyone is capable of testing evaluating and giving constructive feedback	1
quizzes were based off of extremely high level overview videos not covering anything specifically or deep diving into anything when applying the git commands covered numerous errors arose overwhelmingly academic course with very little hands on this is not for anyone actually looking to work in this field but for someone looking to be able to talk about this field	0
basing on the first videos i would not recommend this course to anyone believing that you are expected have basic computer literacy skills such as knowing how to send  receive emails and browse the webthe lector is robotic the slides look outdated listener is bored after  min of watching i definitely would not pay for this coursei will change the rate after i watch more videos but this course is a big nono for me	0
this is just because of the unclarity of the final assignment	0
the course gave a nice overview on strategy formulation but was in my view a bit inconsistent however i learned the main techniques used in formulation so no regrets	2
there was no engagement between the course instructors and students at all it felt like students were running the whole show and discussion forums	0
discussions in this course are voiceless and dead and the instructor never appears in discussions i couldnt understand anything from video lectures cannot understand enunciation not enough detailed lack of examples related to the assignments so the only source was repository httpkasperdanielhansengithubiogenbioconductor with html files and a lot of searching through bioconductor forumsi liked the relevance of quiz questions to real life genomic questions but all quiz questions were outstandingly difficult because of both lack of examples in lectures and errors in some packages inside bioconductoroverall i expected much more from this course and i cannot recommend it to anyone	1
good  but elementary  undergrad level	2
this is a really excellent course prof archers lectures are clear and quite interesting and the course is well structured students are also introduced to the climatemodelsuchicagoedu website which provides both data and analysis tools for studying climate change	4
i really wanted to learn this stuff i have almost no background in statistics but the lectures didnt cover stuff with enough rigor and repetition for me to pick up muchso i pretty much gamed the quizzes and project enough to get through the class rather disappointing	0
good for anyone with basic tax training and would like to dig deeper	4
loved the course it not only fulfilled my expectations it actually was much more than what i was expecting the course is very well structured and i enjoyed it thoroughly i definitely recommend anyone who is interested in digital marketing to enrol in the whole specialisation	4
good course needs a little updating though	3
great course i bet a lot of people will be interested into a second part to this course keep up the good work	4
covers basic statistics mean variance simple z and t tests not what i was expecting as inference multiple testing of data is a sign of poor experimental design and should be avoided not adjusted for bootstrapping is not a new idea and has been used in other fields	0
actually it is too good i have completed priorly when shall i get statement of accomplishment	4
my previous review is  this course teaches nothing about java does not worth the money and timeafter i learned more about coding i realized i was wrong that it is very important to understand html css and js before learning java the only thing is that i wish this course teaches more algorithm	3
the exercises are fun and challenging however the lecture are not related to the exercises and are very hard to follow i think its the same thing as brians class in johns hopkins data science course if you are taking bill howes class just go straight to those exercises and skip lectures	1
this course as much content in it and its difficult to have an holistic idea how it all fits together some videos are taught having the same problem like for example some toolsthemes are presented without us knowing what they are for eg chisquared test and null hypothesis only after a while we understand their use this bring a lot of overhead to us who are learningsome videos seem to have been reworked over time and present cuts or jumpsas for assignments they should be better worked because some questions are not clear or misleading regarding the criteria that you want to evaluatefor example i already reported that in question  and  of the assignment for the rd week the example you give is a short introduction with two problems  i did the website which can make the participant not to be at ease to criticize and  were no evaluating the participant performance but the website next you ask us to rewrite the introduction which we do with those two problems in mind now when we do the peer review we realize that youre expecting for us to rate the new introduction based on having early prototype and user feedback the original problems just seem not to count only by chance you can eventually write the new introduction touching the points that count for grading	2
great job andy definitely is the best	4
improvement over the first course most of the material did not require many references to the apple documentation in order to complete the assignments final project was comprehensive and built on previous work a major flaw of this course is that it is not updated for the newest version of swift many of the techniques and methods taught will not translate to swift 	3
i recommand this course for any one who want to know the history of internet and technology	3
thanks for this fantastic course	4
this course will teach you a little bit of statistics and leave you confused with r the first four weeks are very straightforward they give r code for everything however this is not good because it does not prepare you well for the last project in which you have to do the whole project using r this is almost like learning how to cook without knowing how to use a knife	1
the information is good but basic even at the reduced price it seems pricey and this information could be rolled into another course	2
the course has intrinsic value but as the complexity of the materials covered the weekly slides were a priority to allow students to grasp better the materials covered just relying in the videos to assimilate the content is not an effective form of learning also pausing the videos to watch the definitions in most cases was ineffective as it was hard to see it properly please consider to release the lecture slides to all courses if the slides were available that would helped me to go further in my learning proccess thats why i only give a  the slides are determinant to improve and master to some extent the materials covered	2
very intersting course using various fields of engineering mechanics structures fluid dynamics electricty and project management recommanded to have a good overview of wind energy 	4
ok introduction to material properties but not rigorous leaves out definitions motivation and conclusionsconsequences and skips some things that come up on the quizzes no worked examples	1
i am honestly not a fan of amys teaching style she seems to have a discussion with herself about character building techniques but not really explain the technique nor structure it for the studentthere are too many shop talksi would rather have a structure explained to me and then hear a discussion the way brando skyhorse does in the plot course really a let down i will have to buy the book she keeps averting i guess after spending quite good money on the course already pity	1
excellent instructors curricula and interviews	4
very interesting and useful could be a bit more fastpaced	3
extremely knowledgeable teacher you will learn amazing facts and details of the rise of rock music	4
quiz should be open to all students 	0
the course is just terribleit leaves an impression of being unfinished theres a lot of knowledge missed out from lectures while being expected from the student in the quizzeslecturers themselves have a very vague understanding of how java works and how to code in real life what they say in some lectures is very misleading and gives either false or just insufficient understanding of certain mechanismsthe examples are overcomplicated they demand a full concentration on domain knowledge rather than on programming itself	0
i love this course very specific with tons of practical information good examples	3
capstone project is a little ambiguous although thats good experience having to find a way to reason out what the objective is based on limited informationintroduction to chained dplyr is incredibly useful	3
the speech is too fast to be catch up with and doesnt have much useful contents	1
i do not like the course too difficult for me slides are too full of written lines that professor navarro simply reads	0
the javascript part isnt explained that nicely but overall its a very good course	3
great content but there is no point to keep automatedgrading closed for auditing students	2
i wouldnt recommend this course to anyone whos paying the assignments instructions are too vague to understand and theres no example given	0
 good materialpeer reviewshard to understand exercises	3
the first course of the specialization is very simple the specialization was announced to be on an intermediate level but at the same time you need to spend money on a very basic course with swirl assignments pretty much copying the course content the good thing is that it includes very modern approaches to data analysis and new packages the second course is much better nevertheless	1
great class however i felt it was very heavy on statistics and math concepts versus how to use excel for data analysis i wouldve liked to see some strategies on how to analyze large datasets look for trends and clean up bad data	2
very good course	3
short modules focused quizzes	3
some of the algorithms are pretty cool but overall the course is not worth it the material is pretty weak	1
the structure is a bit confusing and the review is not quite as intensive as i would likeotherwise its awesome the videos are good the instructors speak at speeds just right most of the slides are sparsely worded and well illustrated the concepts are explained in depth awesome is the word	3
very complex and tedious subject	2
an excellent course as a short overview or as an introduction to a specializationseemed to touch on neurology and evolution more than genetics didnt get into the mechanics of genetics or molecular biology as much as i had hoped read genetics for dummies and reviewed my old textbooks to refresh on topics i found interesting and this was a nice course to accompany that endeavor i really enjoyed the short segment near the end that delved into the field of biotechnologythank you so much for providing this as a selfpaced class i really enjoyed taking it	2
this class was extremely disappointing while the material is interesting and the mathematics and computer science are excellent the format of the course makes substantive learning difficult the crux of the course is based on lecture videos unfortunately the videos amount to the professor simply reading off powerpoint slides with occasional quizzes in the video there are only  programming assignments the first of which demanded a total of  new lines of code later assignments are more involved but there are still only  of them i for one only learn effectively when the class is engaging that means slightly more dynamic lectures more involved assignments i dont learn or retain anything meaningful from powerpoints and multiplechoice quizzes and i know that many agree if youre the kind of person who can learn from reading a powerpoint slide then youll be fine i got nothing out of this course	0
i initially found the week two section very frustrating due to the absence of worded examples real sentences that mightve appeared alongside the logicsymbols that were being defined i would put it down to a personal fault if it were not the case that i grasped the notation fully within minutes of finding another source of learning	1
low quality video and audio	1
instructor dr chuck is terrific however assignments are incredibly difficult you are supposed to spend no matter than a few hours a week on the course i spent over  hours alone on the assignments the mentors that are supposed to help you did not help at all very poorly put together second module that does not prepare you to complete the assignments	0
too theoretical	0
it was not w	0
its a very good course to cover basics on eating habits	3
first  weeks are manageable and the final project is great i had a lot of fun 	3
i was really happy to join this class until i saw there was no video learning everything is articles i need something visual i am sorry but this class is not helpful for me i do thank you the teachers but please do remove me thanks	2
great course you will not only learn how to use angularjs but also how it works behind the scene this just makes you understand the framework more thoroughly i am surely gonna try other courses from this author	4
this is a very badly adjusted curse for the coursera frame  ive encountered several quiz questions where i was supposed to write an answer in but this option was not activated for memoreover this course is dramatically prolonged  while the information provided can be easily put into  days a week the most it is somehow is stretched into  weeks taking into account that the course in a list of measures for a successful weight loss its justified to provide the strategies sooner in order to help those willing to start losing weight start doing that the remaining  weeks would be great to help the students track their progress and get some peersupportthe system of not being able to submit any assignment or quiz until you pay for the course is vastly uncomfortable the ability to selfcheck the weeks passed should be provided otherwisethe assignments for peergrading are unnerving  how should peers grade my weightgoals this is a direct ground for further bodyshamingthe course is unfortunately very primitive and lacks further userfriendly design and review	0
very explanatory clear and simple explanations for mathematical complexities	4
great course	4
the information is outdated and i have find some examples services not working anymore during the course	2
superb course and out of the world instructor yaakovs love for cookies and vegetables keeps me goingi wish the modules were released faster so that can do the course at my own pace eg today is a weekend hard to balance with hectic day of work	3
clear but the content is a bit too simple need to include more real world scenario and application	2
an excellent course to help you involve in the art of setting and description i recommend it 	4
it is too easy as a university course it is much more like a pratictioner course the final exam is ridiculous really too easyit can be thought as a week course instead of a four week course	1
in fact the course is fantastic id say that is perfect but it is not because requires payment to be assessment in the activities	1
very organized course and the lectures were clear and short	4
very interesting and applicable advices but the theory too empirical and metaphoric for my taste a little more rigor would not hurtmay   french student	2
well organized and designed	3
i would have rated this course with  stars if it wasnt for the autograder that marked the final assignment which made that i didnt even get to pass the course although according to me and everyone i had contact with regarding this course my code was correct everything else was very well done and i congratulate ms van lent on her course i will be going on to the next course in this specialization because all the autograders for the rest of it has been removed thank goodness	0
the course is very preliminary its content can be covered in one session and does not need  weeks the assignments were not clear enough the course material can not be downloaded and can not be retrieved or used as reference after finishing the course unlike other courses i have taken with coursera but in other university	1
exercise need to be more heavy	2
very broad instruction but very picky quizzes spent more time frustrated with trick questions on quizzes than actually learning something	0
the best explanation so far 	2
the worst course ive ever take in coursera i can pass the course all because i have some background of this topic the lecture taught me nothingconsider i just finish the previous course algorithm for dna sequencing which might be the best course i toke in the coursera this course makes me very disappointed if the previous course gives me the faith to continue learning something in coursera this course must be the reason that let me leave the coursera lefti cant even understand why there are some guys give this course  stars if there is  stars option ill put this score in front of the lecturer and tell her what a bad course her give us	0
its quite interesting but definitely not a beginners one im put off quite a bit by the exclusively financial examples	2
the vision of enlightenment that professor shapiro offers is interesting to understand why democracy comes in waves and the dynamics between capitalism and socialism	4
im actually really interested on this course but ericas accent is terrible its so hard to understand and focus on what shes saying had to quit the course because of that	0
just some basic knowledge most of the knowledge is not expanded or deep introduced	0
good information can be a bit longer completed too quickly can improve on the quizzes	3
not recommended	0
most of the information in this course is common sense it may be relevant for someone with very limited knowledge about food but for anyone who is moderately informed and interested in food there is not much to learn here	0
homework lectures and the quiz are completely out of sync bayes rule is introduced and appears in the homework but no where else things appear on the quiz that arent in the home work or lecture this was put together from scraps of another lecture but in an incoherent fashion when caffo tells the viewer that theyll need to use other resources he wasnt kidding i dropped this the first time when i kept introducing things that completely had not been introduced took another stats class then came back and aced it i dont mind accelerated learning or using other resources but theres guide for which concepts are needed and where coverage for them can be found this leaves little recourse but to know stats already or go learn it before taking this course otherwise you dont know enough to even go find the pieces you need incidentally the dude who does the lectures for khan academy does a fantastic job and the lectures are a joy to watch though some people might prefer something that moves less slowly and carefully and perhaps they would prefer something that glosses over the fundamental concepts more if thats the case i cant say enough good things about biostatistical analysis by zar but thoroughly logically categorizing statistical methods with short clear examples references to the original research and building up one concept after another in logical order the chapters are short but the first  or so should give you a good enough foundation to deal with about any intro stats class as it is caffos presentation needs some serious testing and remodeling but theres no indication that itll match what khan academy did regardless of how much work goes in at best its a bitter pill you can swallow if you already know the concepts	0
i really enjoyed the class opened up my eyes to a new level being a mom i feel i am more aware and listen to what the little ones say honor and respect their view thank you	4
the course fails to clearly explain how to use so many of the formulas that the professor just glides over in class the quiz was far harder than it should have been mainly because the professor failed to properly introduce and teach students to use the formulas	1
great material the inclusion of case studies definitely helps	4
great course great professor tons of notes and good examples in code	4
some of the assignments seemed overly complicated and irrelevant to the topics discussed on a few occasions the videos would mention something but never discuss the reasoning once i posted to the forum and no one answered so i never asked about the other questions i found during the videos	1
this is an excellent course for those who want to get a better understanding about the brain and how it processes everyday stimulus the professor is without doubt very knowledgable and explains everything in a very professional and yet simple way	3
honestly this course was a waste of time the professor seems to have gathered some information about the version history of ios and android platforms thrown it onto some slides and then reads from those slides there is no discussion of the context of those technologies	0
very basic	1
this course feels like a bad news anchorman reading the teleprompter it gives a lot of formulae without proper explanations a lot of quiz answers do not come from the video lectures the course is really just spitting formulae from the dissertation trajectory generation and control for quadrotors by daniel warren mellinger easily found using search engines reading the dissertation before doing the course would probably help understand the formulae they say out of context without the proper explanations sorry for the bad review its the first time i leave one like that although ive completed many moocs i hope it will help to improve the course	1
i took onus with a number of ideasconcepts offered simply because they are either misrepresentative of sm or untrue first the the prof who talked about visuals overplayed the role of visuals online the internet began as a text communications vehicle not a medium to share graphics etc the rise of video images only grew as the technology evolved to allow easy distribution words are still key onlineare there any websites major who do not use words in fact for many of the good ones visuals take a secondary role to the actual written content second the section about joining a community and then faking your way to gaining credibility by posing as a newbie etcespecially by marketersis highly reviled by many sm communities as an influencer who has been approached by many marketers in the past decade to help them understand something etc i can tell you we do suss you out quickly and treat you appropriately we are not here to provide free consulting to make you feel or look competent or knowledgeable as we would for real members of a community i contacted a friend whos an influencer in different communities to me with what your expert suggested he too was not happy with what was in this unit if you want to know why marketers have a bad rep its because of bad advice given in webinars like this one i am so glad i did not pay for this course	1
great introduction to the international courts	4
good course for understanding programmingdaler	4
not enough material though for a full course this whole course can be done in few hours by people with some experience in programming unfortunately this does not provide enough possibilitiesassignments to deeply relate to the language and really feel comfortable in it not even at the beginners level as is the aim of the course nice slow introduction though	2
very comprehensive and informative course on machine learning however some of the lectures are a little dry and i fell asleep	3
this is the second course in the full stack series by hong kong university because i find the first course in this series very interesting the assignments are challenging and easy to understand the professor does a very good job in explaining the materials i continue to take the second course which is this one a shoot however it is a complete disappointmentin every single assignment it requires a file which is built by going through every single lectures of the course that means i have to go through every videos and copy his code to my code in order to get the file if you have a lot of time that is perfectly fine however if you are a college student like me you properly will not be able to commit that much time personally when i take a course i take a look at the assignment and then see what knowledge i need to have in order to complete the assignment because of this i may watch the lecture or just google out the answer requiring a file in order to complete an assignment strips away my liberty in doing so furthermore if you miss a step in the video your file may very well be ruined and you need to rewatch the video again to see what you missedalso the course is extremely slow paced i have to play back rate to x normal speed sadly even with faster speed the lectures are also poorly structured there are many other materials online that can cover the same amount of information in less time and easier to understand combined with the required file for each assignment this course can easily be a torture	1
i didnt really enjoy this course	1
excellent course could do with a little more visual references some of the talks are a bit tough to get through since you are watching  people content still very valuable	3
very basic	1
superb presentation of objective methods to approach negotiations with exercises and	3
far too basic in content its clearly aimed at people with next to no experience at all on writing and publishing however it still is insightful and inspirational as writing for young readers is taught by two established children writers and packed with interviews of other writers from all around the world a nice introduction but just that an introduction if you have experience writing for children or else	2
i am loving this course	4
totally beneficial	3
this course is way too basic so basic it doesnt even cover some of the essential basics like explaining what the box model is in css the only reason i gave  stars is because you can still learn something with it if you are a complete newbie but it is very far to be reliable if you are aiming to be a professional there is a long road to go after you finish this course which makes me think the certificate is almost pointless and worthlessit also uses things that are generally considered a bad practice like using dom event attributes in the html it is okay to present that to the students but you should also mention that while they are there it is usually not recommended to use them and explain what would be the recommended practicei have taken courses from other sites like codeschools codecademy and treehouse and left coursera for later because i believed that getting a certificate would require me to have some expertise but so far i feel kind of disappointed with the full stack packagei am hoping it will get better with the next modules	1
excelent thanks	4
 we didnt have any feedback i couldnt review my partners because there isnt projects to review teacher never answer forums	0
i concur with others of a similar opinion on this courseassignment instructionscriteria differ from the grading rubric criteria assignments mostly copy and paste referring people to the bootstrap docs as reference defeats the purpose of an instructor many of the assignments required you to do things against best practices like inserting inline styles to make your element look like the instructors screenshot of his pagethe last weeks content seemed to be a slapdash mix of bits and pieces and trying to inform people about node modules via solving a quadratic equation seemed really strange how about an example from the real world like even an ecommerce application in the comments on this the instructor said there wasnt time in this course to explain node modules but that he provided a clearer example in the nodejs course hunh why wouldnt you do a simpler example in the driveby assignmentinstructor consistently mispronounced words that are central to the field which just seemed weird and made me question his credibility this might sound petty but kuhroozezel for the word carousel it would be like a fashion designer mis pronouncing tulle as tullee or bias as byeezjust not impressed i am glad my employer paid the tuition and not me the only positive was it enforced a schedule and structure for me to try my hand at bootstrap i had already worked with foundation	1
i didnt learn a lot from this course it didnt explain technical it architectures of iot	1
inspiring lecturers with excellent material	4
the course covers very useful and interesting topics not in very much detail though it is useful to begin with the topics but it is really not more that a thin introduction	1
i like the course and the material i would suggest to include quiz to the end of each sectionas well it will be easier to write a story from final task after each section not at the very end	2
this course needs much more work from instructors before it gets offered to the public it is poorly assembled offers hardly comprehensible material with no or very few resources to turn to reading material is listed but they are useful for people already skilled in bayesian statistics exercises are worded such that even the questions are a challenge to understand quizzes contain material never mentioned during lessons discussion forums are left unanswered by the teaching staff  or if they reply they do it in a very negligent manner no support on the merits a major disappointment	0
quizzes and assignments are poorly designed you will spend most of your time tuning parametersand deriving matrices that were never discussed in the course unfortunate	1
i am satisfied with provided information and can say that assignments was pretty interesting for me love maps and coordinate systems so last assignment was especially interesting	4
very basic not much deep	1
awesome course	4
too basic and not thorough enough the assignments are too easy also because of over specific assignments instructions	1
cant actually be done as a free course like others on the site you have to pay just to get a quiz grade	0
hubiera sido genial que se puedan dar los exámenes y ya el pago por el certificado aparte  it will be really great that you can make the quizz and get your results without paying because you will not get the verified certify	1
useful and detailed	4
the htmlcssjs course is one of the best courses i ever enrolled in and i strongly recommend it to everyone	4
 would program again	0
learned a lot about the fundamentals of supply and demand and other related topics lectures were informative and enjoyable assignments tested fundamental knowledge recommend to anyone interested in the basics of economics	4
it was much more complete diverse and timeconsuming than expected the quality of the teachings was inequal in my humble opinion i found prgermano a bit stiff in his teaching and it was very hard for me to follow his classes other teachers were great though	2
well developed materialclearly stated informationinformative and put forth in a vivid way	4
great first week i like frans first week video with the puppets and very engaging interactionthe next following  weeks are total bummer it does give some tips for character design such as what is tangent or some other design tips but it feels like a bloated interview and not a classlike experience great first week terrible following week	1
not so impressed with this course so far lets see the rest of the specialisation	1
definitely the best css tutorial i have seen at coursera	4
as it is unfortunetly i can only rate it as a  the lectures are presented in a reasonable way but this is a somewhat technical course for wich additional materials would need to be mandatory there are no slides for the lectures the instructor mentions chapters of a book and does not provide the materials to students pursue a more effective way of studying the materials also the quizzes are excessively challeging taking into consideration that the only resource availble to students are the videos in my opinion presenting a course that only has videos is not an effective way of learning to make this course more effective and to allow students to learn more effectivelly and get some learning objectives more material besides the videos must be made available as it is no more than a  is possible to rate this course	1
updatecoursera or the course content provider has changed this course in a bad way you have to pay for the course in full amount just to get your assignments submitted and reviewed by peer learnerwhat a pitygreat course material is very useful and interestingthe course introduces concepts in a progressive and comprehensive way so that knowledge is easy to be understood practise quiz and assignments perfectly reflects course materialsalso professor muppala is quite funny enjoy the course	1
it really helpful	4
this course would be much better if there was some actual substantive content this course was not worth 	0
excellent course provided by prof mcgready i recommend it to everyone who wants to start a solid background for biostatistics	4
this course is very helpful to motivate oneself to create a website but it looks like the authors themselves made the course in one weekend the lectures are too short and not informative enough to complete the assignments some videos dont show what the lecturer is talking about maybe there is bug or something but there is only some irrelevant picture the due dates are inconsistent through different pages finally the next day after the course ends i am not able to view my assignments and the grade for the last assignment even though the authors sent an email that it would be possible	2
too many videos and not cluttered assignment codes	0
slow videos repeating several times the same thing not a pedagogical  good to fix an idea kind of repetition which makes them hard to followhowever the worst are the exercises the first time after  other coursera scala related courses where i have to actively check the forums for minute details about what is expected  implied for the solutions to pass the gradingthings like what to do when updating the kmeans and you have duplicates subtle differences between average and mean etc in all other courses the expectation of the exercises were sufficiently clear and straight forward that i never had to check the forums to solve themalso the code style of the exercises is literally an antipattern in idiomatic scala against everything learnt in the previous scala courses var all over the place low level loops like in c or java etc 	0
it is quite useful a course cause it mentiones me part of the mistakes i made unawarely during my study and teaches me a lot of unusual learning techniques the instructors use metaphor and anologies to help us understand the concepts and theories more actively and efficientlythanks to the teachers i gain more confidence in learning and challenging difficult subjects now	4
the course is very well laid out to demonstrate the main features of r programming language to elaborate on one thing that i liked the programming assignment for the th week ratingchoosing hospital based on outcome is very helpful to try out what i learnt from the course so far all the  parts of this question are connected well and i hope the rest of the courses of the data specialization is also implementing similar format	3
i am left feeling this course needs work i dont know if its the pain of switching to the new platform or what but the total lack of any support from the tainstructor team is frustrating add to that the fact that brian skips from slide to slide very quickly often not providing adequate explanations and youll be rewatching the videos many times overseveral of the videos have blatant errors in them like the fast that the fourth video of a week also contains the entire third video againsuch things should not have passed a half decent qa testmore than anything this specialization should not be marketed as no previous experience needed you need to know some statistics and by some i mean do the whole thing on khan academy first	1
excepting some coding on big data	2
loved this course very much related to real life case scenarios	4
this course is where the material starts to get difficult and the learning materials fail to provide the structure needed there absolutely has to be a better teaching method than reading the slides of bulleted text that im also showing no functional examples are provided in the lectures and the real learning content is linked out to web resources you will have to google your way through this class because the provided instruction will not contain answers to the quiz or exam questions a real disappointmenti also think that coursera knows this because this was the first course where they ramped up the email encouragement campaign their data must tell them this is where people fall off the specialization rather than addressing with marketing and messaging they should encourage the instructors to improve the course	1
dr chuck thank you for another excellent course your charm sense of humor and carefully crafted lessons are a joy to follow and complete i look forward to the next courses in the specialization with you	4
hands on should have been more involveddificult	3
thanx 	4
wonderfully explained simple and precise 	4
for these who major in computer science in university this course can be kind of easy but its really acceptable for those who have no experience with programming it can be a good way to get started with python	3
needs weekly code testsneeds more quiz questionsneeds more usage samples  eg autolayoutspecific ui components gotchas	2
some exercises need some improvement tests were not that helpful and the instruction to the last homework was quite bad many open questions	0
its more a preview than an actual class	1
weak definitely not what i would call a course should have been at least twice as long to give more depth also too many typein answers for quizzes	1
super boring  clinical presentation of the material	1
it was a little short and the quizzes and short assignments are too easy so they do not really cement your knowledge of the programming concepts i believe beginners should enroll in another python course or selfstudy more on the side to fully grasp the concepts nevertheless it was a good introduction to python	2
i liked this information but i wouldnt call it a courseim a certified pt and i benefit from the information but many books have been written about the subjects as welli personally loved the information given as it gave me a touchup on my knowledge and tips to give to my clients	4
this course tells you to use a timer while studying without the tv on and to avoid procrastination it also stresses review while learning this isnt anything new the course discusses diffuse and focused modes diffuse modes are described as being as important as focused modes running day dreaming and sleep can help enter diffuse modes and integrate focused learning save you time and skip this course	0
poor course no original material they use tableau training material i did the first  weeks of the course in  hours and learned nothing new except using tableau i could have learned the same using the tableau first video in  minutes	0
for an introductory course it is ok however cant help get the feeling that the material is just skimmed through in an effort to structure each session in the same way detail has been missed out practical examples and handson exercises are very inadequate not impressed	2
although i already had much of the conceptual framework and general history of the course the presentations filled in the missing detail of events and causes beautifully illustrated with art and maps from the different eras	4
i found the course pretty basic it did cover the topics well  however indepth understanding and newer concepts for eg exercises on time quadrants could have been introduced  explained in detail	1
the material itself isnt bad but the course instructors never respond to questions whats the point of the class if i cant get my questions answered	0
please change this course completely sure you need at least x more time to do a good course the course is very fast and the lessons are not enoght to teach in a good way bad bad course	1
the course goes direct to the point its very objective the only disadvantage is the italian accent of the professors sometimes its boring to listen i reccomend this course to students or for people outside the fashion world	3
this course talks about a really important subject  that is probably one of its key benefitsi got really passionate and worked hard on the theme and after completing i felt that it did not gave or matched the expectations on the course namesubject benefitsimportant theme  within business context discussed with good videos and referenceshistorical perspective on creativity is soundprof shlomo maital is a warm highly informed and passionate person about the subjectthe course in week  and  makes you think on your one key creativity processesand it almost stops there since the purpose of the course gets flawed by the lack of requirements in the peer review supporting materials and forum health that is why the course talks does fail in training teachingkey points to not advice this course  at least in the paid version  see until n lack of support materials support based on the zizozi book to be bought outside of the course costreading of the zizozi book in the context of the course  with some answers to the quizzes being in the book and not in the course material dive into very interesting methods made only superficially  da vinci method ideo pex with needs to be explained further complete or near complete lack of requirements for the classification of the peer review making it very flawed  see the definition of scalability per example and how to rank it forum use and reply almost near nullnessi do expect this course to be revised deeply in its execution  see per example agile from darden to benchmark	0
there is a lot of good information in the course about how different components communicate with each other in android however there is way too much information way too fast i really enjoyed the rhythm in the first course but this course left me lost more times than not its a great course if you plan on spending large amounts of time searching the web for other resources to complete the optional assignments	2
the course is excellent	4
interesting course overall  suitable for beginners	3
this course was very helpful for the work i do	4
i was incredibly excited to start this course the outline looks amazing for learning mediums like this you have to start strong keep up the great work you all look like you know what youre doing you should certainly put some polish on all these videos its near impossible to follow along id be curious in seeing the data on how many of your students finish this course	0
repetitive and stating the obvious from all sorts of angles but this may be usual for business classes	1
great course dr tim chamillard you are the bestwaiting for more courses from dr t	4
excellent pacing and balance of programming and theory work have come away with a much better overview of the field in general as well as more detailed experience with a number of academic programming examples	4
very basic introduction	2
great simply great i highly recommend the four part course series	4
hi team i just had one feedback on the course content that there were some princip	2
the slides are very difficult to follow it could be better designed	0
very boring not engaging at all uses the phrase you know and um too much	0
very clearly analyzed and very practical	4
really dreadful absurdly fast progress with really dry graphics where they cover the history of economics in about  minutes to make things worse the lecturer who doesnt appear in the videos speaks incredibly fast while graphs and bullet point lists fly by on the screen theres not time to process the information and complicated terms and processes are explained in just a few secondsim disappointed as it looked like an interesting course but doesnt live up to some of the really great courses available which employ great teaching and delivery	0
exposure to libraries and advanced features of scala	3
there were several technical issues no submission button for peerreviewed assignment right answers listed as wrong and vice versa in the clips etc the lecturer also sounded a bit unnatural with pauses in sentences where you wouldnt expect them making it harder to process information the course material itself wasnt bad but the execution just seemed a little unfinished	1
needs improvementlecture and associated staff should participate more in the discussion forums	2
a good introduction to anybody interested in learning what is data science	3
very effective course for me it really helps me to understand the basics of grammar	4
is not a completed and structured course it needs more examples to get the idea exactly	2
we surely all know that the human power is vital to the develop of any given organization and an effective talent pipeline would help a lot but theres not enough practical advices about how in this course	2
too fast video is too short and spend a lot of time in the summary	1
some topics that are important are obviated	1
very interesting topic and great instructorsunfortunately many things were not covered by video lectures it often felt like there were parts missing	2
i thought this was very very basic	1
leaders need this course its clearly focus and amazing	3
while the content of this course is interesting and wellstructured the way its presented on coursera has major problemsas it stands this is not really a coursera course its simply a coursera wrapper around some links to a thirdparty website all of the things that make coursera valuable  videos with inline quizzes ability to download content the exam format peer assessment  are missing in fact having coursera as a wrapper actually makes it more difficult to use because additional clicks are required to access any resource and nothing is accessible offline if this course is to be offered on coursera it needs major rework to take advantage of the platformthis is a real shame because there is some great content here and obviously a lot of care has been taken to structure it carefully for the original stanford course for that reason recommend using the stanford web site directly	0
who can read korean should really learn this course	2
i disliked really slow speed of formulas derivation simple operations like cancelling out terms are done in multiple steps like for children that only starting study mathematics otherwise great course	3
the reason why i gave one star is because i dont think its content is completely related to its title this course is very similar to music production but using only pro toolsif you are looking to learn more about music production using pro tools then this is an awesome course but if you already have some background in music production and you just want to learn pro tools basics then i dont think this is an appropriate course in my opinion	0
this course is just great	4
should update to angular  or at least revise some exercises to include code for angular  and keep track properly of when gulpfile should be updated	2
interesting grasp of foundations in modeling	3
great and excellent thoughts and course material	3
level of difficulty low	2
all the modules but last are really interesting and informative the last weeks module is very poorly explained a beginner cannot really understand it	1
it is informative but there are many basics that were not covered well  there was a lot of information that was not that interesting like too much history	2
very good machine learning classbut sometimes a little bit short on the mathematical proofs	3
a very challenging but interesting course love how we were guided to research through out the course	4
really a good course for people who suffers a lot in modern society some ways to cultivate positive emotions on this course really help me a lot and the most important thing while learning this course is to practicing and applying it into reality which is really amazing	2
an absolutely dreadful course the only things youll end up studying are how to use the spreadsheets given and what the instructor was thinking when creating them i cant figure out what and there doesnt seem to be any way of finding out the lectures were mostly stuff i learned at school and really quite easy but i just have no idea what the final project has got to do with the lectures	0
the course is excellent	4
you can clearly see that the professor is a passionate and has got a huge knowledge about the topic he is talking about what he says is interesting and valuable i also liked to learn facts about historical facts and anecdotes accompanying the lectures i learnt a lot and listened to a lot new musicit takes quite a lot of time to watch all the videos take notes the exams are not that easy   and listen to all of the examples but it was definitely worth it	4
amazing id be so much further if schools would require this course early on in education incourperating lessons from this course in early education or even as a whole would be benificial in standardized testing and students progression in overall learning i loved this course now im looking foward to learning so much more thank you and everyone who made this course available to people like me	4
i have not personally completed the coursebut as far as i have progressed i am finding it very helpful and explained in a very simple manner	4
thank you for a very in	3
this course was excellenti first found the course odd since the instructor went through the material quite quickly in the lectures it took me a while to figure out that the material was available as a course download once i found that it was easy to follow along with the instructorneed two monitors ideally for this to work if you cannot step through the jupyter notebook as the instructor goes through the material you will be lostand you will not get the most out of the class	4
great material and wonderful instruction one of the better courses out there	4
highly recommended	3
the course is pretty good but not mobile friendly course since the font size becomes way too small for visibility hence learning is not possible while travelling by train  car to utilize unproductive timeotherwise contentwise it is pretty good	3
it was difficult to me i think that s more appropriate to whom is already familiarized with the terms and concepts	1
dr sinnottarmstrong does an amazingly thorough and detailed job and the progression of the course is well planned and well executedi wanted to give the course a higher rating but unfortunately the good doctors explanatory skills only served to confuse and frustrate me the further i progressed through the course extemporaneous examples were unintentionally and unnecessarily muddled there were numerous misspoken or confused terms that could easily have been rerecorded or edited and the splicing between the old course and the new one is sometimes discontinuous though to be fair they warn us about that at the beginningnevertheless i would still highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a thoroughgoing universitylevel course in critical thinking and basic argumentation	2
the lack of teacher or teaching assistant participation in the forum discussions is deafening for an institution like the host institution this is odd i liked the course but it was not very well organized seems like it was for experienced musicians eve though the goals of the course hinted at it being for beginners as well good course badly organized	1
very good introductory course	3
excellent combination for education purpouse	3
very good its easy to learn	4
hello i learned some new knowledge about entrepreneurship and this course was helpful for me however there was not any reaction to the comments in the forum from instructors and mentors i studied several courses online in the coursera community and this course was the first course for me which instructors and mentors did not reply to the questions in the forums in my opinion the forums are one of the great features in the coursera which could really helps student to learn the content bettersincerelyomid	1
there is quality implicit in the approach taken but in my opinion this course is excessively short having only  minutes of videos per week what is very limiting also there is no slides of the material covered what i find not adequate to fully grasp the theories underlyind in the lectures slides would be determinant just watching videos and doing quizzes is not a very effective form of learning	1
too simplistic and not enough real world examples it was clear instructor regurgitated material directly off of the screen offered zero highlights to real world experience or issues rather than wasting a couple hours listening to presentations download the slides and read them yourself disappointing	1
this course is packed with interesting and useful information for patients	4
excellent coursedr chuck is an excellent professional and of course an excellent and funny trainer this course has improved my knowledge about the python programming language	4
maybe too basic sometimes but the teacher explains everything in a very good way the platform works amazingly	3
clear and useful	3
some of the videos made too long by unnecessary clips from hollywood which illustrate the point but are too long the assignment of the final week felt tacked on and not at all related to what was taught that week	2
way too many abstract concepts that are not relevant to the challenges that i encounter in my daytoday role i wish this course would actually show me how to solve practical business problemsthe nd part of the course is not enjoyable at all sorry	1
it was a very interesting course however it was biased toward spanish history with the inclusions i was really more interested in what i thought the course was supposed to be about anyway medieval manuscripts i had a terrible time deciphering the lecturers english and because im not interested in a course certificate the course projects were a waste of my time though i can see that they could be fun and add to the enjoyment of the course	1
the course is oriented to alumni that have a minimal experience with design concept refreshing and updating know how with interesting information sharing with the classmates the pratical exercises helps to consolidate technics and expertise	2
there was basically nothing in it he only repeated the points in the presentation no explaining just throwing around numbers	0
i normally struggle to give poor reviews to free online content but there are so many glaring fundamental issues with the presentation and content of this course that it i feel its important to warn people not to waste their time with this course in its current formthe mapping and planning lectures raise some good points but the rest give only the most basic overview of the topic at hand glossing over steps enough that you would probably learn just as much watching youtube or looking around inside wordpress on your own the delivery of the lectures needs a lot of work with distracting erratic pauses between words and the sound frequently cutting out midword as they switch between slides i found it difficult to make it through more than  minutes of contenti gave more than  star because the links underneath the slides contain some valuable information so if you can be bothered trawling through the slides you can gleam some knowledge therehopefully the creators of the course take on board the many negative reviews and give a major overhaul to the course to bring it in line with the quality of almost all other content on coursera	1
ended up not being able to take the rest of the courses i paid for because coursera kept pushing it back start date after start date moved 	0
nice but only for those who search their first job	2
there was not the same application of programming skills as in the previous courses also this course started too late after the other courses and i lost a lot of momentum in completing coursework	1
no guidelines for peer review assessments technical issues very clunky website	0
it is very very bad that only students assess the assignments lots of students cant count sentences cant see and generally are very negligent in evaluating the work of others no teachers involve the process no appelation possibility no forum for discussions	0
peergraded assignments are bad for multiple reasons most important one  if im paying for this course i expect my work will be verified by skilled people not by other students	2
a lot of talking i missed some practical tasks  projects to be lead through to practise the subject	1
there is no any discusson forums in there its so disappointing ive paid for course and unable to ask questions	1
i saw two main issues with this course  dated lecture videos oftentimes with r code that cant be replicated using uptodate packages and  lack of thoughtful design example after example after example after example doesnt really teach you anything	1
needs more info and practical references	2
i enjoyed it from the beginning	4
very interesting and enjoyable perhaps a little shorter than i expected although i only audited the course	3
some interesting points of view and case studies but the material itself is not in a structured format that means you could lose your way half way through the video too one dimensional in terms of presentation and no opportunity to interact with tutors to summarize i think it is a waste of opportunity to not use the videointeractivitycollaboration platform to its fullest potential	1
high on opinion and low on scholarship	0
great insight	3
i was disappointed by the lack of response from teachers to the consultations	2
proseffort has been taken in putting up the assignmentsconsquality of teaching is very poor and too fast to follow through  instructors have rushed to present course material  i would not recommend this course  princeton and stanford offer much higher quality and presentation on the same topics	1
inroductory course good for begineers	3
week  is very badbad quality of videobad speaker	2
superficial coverage of quiz and final exam material in the video lectures without getting the textbook and reading it in depth it is difficult to do well in this class	0
its been awesome so far great work and material good way to teach toothanks a million	4
very well organised and presented the course would be perfect if the transcript made sense and it does not because it is full of filler words and incomplete sentences or if the course had supporting material to read one of the two	3
too base for experienced people not enough fundamental for beginnersafter  weeks didnt find any useful information it also very boring so recommend to see video on   speedthe course need to be significantly changed who are the target audience how many resources do we have time etc what we would see as a result of course knowledge skills hard softetc	0
of all the courses i have ever taken in my ba ma phd and mba coursework this was the worse this is a tragically bad course no learning outcomes discussed and the teaching is sort of mumbling while underlining and reading slides that are way too complicated and crowded just awful mistakes in quizzes and exams frequent misspellings low effort one instructor ms mayer simply reads the slides line by line that is not teaching please learn how to teach and interact with your students u of minn should be ashamed of this course and provide some training on how to run a distance learning course to its instructors as it is the course is disappointing on every level to top it off the instructor has the nerve to show off his boat and tell us how rich he is blech poor taste	0
im not able to submit my assignments	0
lots of cutting edge mathematical and computer vision concepts but a serious lack of support no technical staff around to help only one or two examples of how the math works and a general poor explanation of the conceptsthis course is not for beginners and i recommend you steer clear if you do not posses at minimum a bachelors in mathematics	1
assignments would need to be improved	2
dear organizers teacher and colleaguesit was very pleasure for me to study this course i like this course very much because the teacher explains the difficult economic process very easy if you have questions you can discuss itit was a very interesting coursethank you very much for this coursewith best regardsmaryna stegniienko	4
excellent course and specialization	4
nowhere near as useful as the first two courses the assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course materials	2
enough basic knowledge	3
i struggled with some of the instruction as i couldnt get the exercisesquizes to work right even with multiple views of the videos posting questions etc	2
a good introductory course i recommend this course highly	2
a little on the easy side but is a great introduction to python	3
great course took it since it was the most popular mooc on coursera have started using a few of the techniques and they are very effective highly recommended no matter who you are and what you do	4
too much focus on portfolio investments topic would expect more on modeling principles in broader context	1
i found this course to be very basic i appreciate that marketing requires a broad interaction but a course designed to take  weeks with  weeks of actual content is too much i need to learn about costperclick impressions roi on ad spend  that sort of thing i dont see how d printing is relevant to the majority of people in marketing today	0
excellent course concise concepts description with examples rooted into real life thank you	4
this course seems to be a great course but personally i think its notit talks about so many things but none of them are explained clearly i cant get the picture of this field clearlythe assignment looks nice but its not first its not wellorganized sometimes you need to look at next weeks course to do this weeks quiz the programming assignment is very very unsatisfying its not explained clearly theres no helpful instruction and it is very confusing you need to spend hours and hours just understanding what you need to do and some algorithms are not even told in the course and you need to implement them i know this could be a good exercise but i would hope it at least provide some useful resourcesgenerally i am very disappointed i feel like im spending hours and hours but learning nothing just confusion please consider reformat the homework make it more doable for new learners in this field	1
i have no doubt teachers are excelent professionals in the area as well as great machine learning enthusiasts however i did not like the fact that you get limited to learn how to use a paid and very expensive platform mostly because there are many other free packages available for machine learning ok the platform offered makes things easier but if you really want to learn machine learning you can not be limited to a platform acting as a robot just using prewritten functions in a black box	1
great content	3
this course and material does not articulate the google cloud platform offerings maybe google does not want to compete with microsoft azure and aws alike if google itself has approved this google cloud platform trainings on coursera then vola i am out i am way better off supporting aws and azure at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited	0
was expecting a course geared towards how popularity affects adults in day to day life and how to improve ones own popularity this course expands upon the various studies done with respect to children and adolescents it also provides a few examples of how popularity in early life extends to adult life still a very useful course if you have children or wondered what it took to be popular as a child but due to the difference in expectations im giving this course a  instead of a 	3
this is a good course i would just do some things a little differently for example i dont agree with weighing oneself daily	2
tldr  good videos but short and not always relevant material the course should be titled a first light introduction to strategy implementationthe strategy implementation course is rather a first introduction to the concepts the material is quite short only  minutes of videos every week and no interviews with reallife managersthe additional articles to read most relate to bluechip companies that succeeded samsung toyota netflix google and of course the obligatory apple mentioned in every strategy course on the planet however it would be much more interesting to discuss failures andor duller companiesfinally the final peerreview exercise is a bit broken but that is the case of every mooc peergraded approach cf httpswwwinsidehigheredcomblogshackhighereducationproblemspeergradingcoursera to know moreon the upside videos are well edited and clear and easy to understand	1
the course is short but you get to learn a lot about how memory works best study and learning practices and how to manage your timethe videos are short and quiz you at the end so its very easy to keep your focusi would advise taking this course even if you arent a student anymore like me	4
its too advanced for people with no experience in statistics and sometimes too abstract to relate with	2
this was a four star course and the links to additional information were a good resource  stars for the discussions which were left unanswered much of the time and not a highly active mentor group much was left to student when stuck and exasperated options	2
this course though fun was not intensive at all the main issue i have is probably with the coursera structure itself many of your homework assignments are based off of if people can understand the instructions of the game which if you have mostly nonenglish speakers sort of takes the homework from being be creative and challenge yourself to make sure everything you write down is  words max or else the people grading you wont understand it this is also true when looking at these students games when half of your grade depends on your clarity these kids are ultimately at a disadvantage im sure there were amazing games made by some of the nonenglish speaking students but i wasnt able to understand and play many of them it is fantastic that coursera is open to everyone but when your grades are based off of clarity of language it gets tricky	1
a great course for financial marketsshiller is an amazing professorenjoy this course with a open mind	4
very disappointed in this course light on content and heavy especially in week  on political bias towards one political persuasion highly biased and controversial statements by those in videos are taken as fact without any attempt to question it i expected a course to talk about elections and apply it to  instead what is here is a course that not so subtly seems to have an agenda not good for academic discourse i believe this is my first negative review in my  or so years on coursera	0
best course for lab workers physics is deal in a great detail	4
i cant understand what he talk about need a sub	0
i would say a fundamental course for vlsi	2
easy to understand	4
im getting coursera verification prompts too often this doesnt happen in any of the other courses ive takenim taking	0
my review  its a big picture course despite not so deep its sometimes a bit confusing because the topics are aparently uncorrelated maybe in fact i couldnt catch it	3
was a good introduction the focus was good as i feel i came away with knowledge of the field as opposed to technology only recommendation is to ask professors to use more practical examples in the lectures	3
this is a very general overview of the topic but lacks depth	1
nice course but i did not recieved my certificate yet	2
for peer review i wuold add the possibility by the valuated candidate to express a counterback valuation on the person who assigned himher the vote relative on the efficacy of the suggestion and the consistency of the judgement on his work	3
i found the wording of the assignments really difficult to follow so i didnt really understand what was expected of me i spend a lot of time and therefore money on this course but in the end i made a conscious decision to stop i was taking it for personal pleasure and it was not worth the stress each week of trying to work out what was being asked i have taken a number of other courses in creative writing elsewhere and other courses on coursera  this is the first one i have actively chosen to stop because i just wasnt engaging with it  either for education or for enjoyment	0
haven enrolled in this short online course in chinese for beginners has really helped me now a masters student at bnu its easy for me to communicate on campus and even outside campus it makes it easier for a native to give you help since you can say something in chinese i am amazingly thrilled with my ease of lifestyle in beijing thanks to coursera	3
worst course forever	0
very basic for absolute beginners managers completely new to data let alone data science	0
i consider the assignment is not very useful network plot usually does not help much if you are researching dataset scatterplot histogram can be much useful tableau sorry cant afford it why not excel at least almost anyone uses it not very practical one but it does contains a lot of information in the course	2
loads of room for improvement	1
although the content is correct quality models videos and materials is very low wanted to make all the specialization but im not satisfied with the quality of the course its a shame because the jhu is an excellent university	0
wide course on r and perfect introduction to its world need quite a bit of effort for non programers	3
very good course	4
nice course at least to start with	2
a bit too theoritical	2
great videos and good course structurei did feel the assignments were sometimes a bit too easy a lot was preprogrammed and the tobe implemented formulas were often provided in the assignments this made it quite timeefficient but perhaps the understanding improves when working with lecture notes for people to refer to when recalling formulas from the lectures	3
very good introductory course	3
not that much techniques to learn just general course about social mediaso its not cost effective 	0
i have mixed feelings it was way too easy for me but my wife did it too and it was about right in difficulty for her but either way i felt like it just taught you to install stuff rather than actually teaching meaningful material	2
very interesting course fairly interactive the structure could have been better to make it clear what we had learnt and give us more of a take away after each week and at the end although there were a lot of academic links each week the course didnt explore the differing perspectives and ideas it was more focussed on barbaras own theories definitely a good introduction and great personal learning	3
too much math this course was not at all what i was expecting it to be which could be both good and bad depending on your own perspective it concentrates heavily on the logistical side of negotiations via mathematical analysis to figure out whats at stake in a negotiation ie the pie and less so on learning actual negotiation techniques i got halfway through the first week before deciding to unenroll that said professor nalebuff has a very engaging teaching style and presents each lecture in a dynamic fashion via animation if you are a math whiz who excels in algebra and can do complex mathematical equations quickly on the fly then this course will definitely benefit you if you are like me however and looking for a course that will focus more on artistry and practical realworld application then this course is not for you	1
that is good	3
good course	4
i loved it its extremely helpfull	4
dunno wwhats the point of making two separate courses with different names the content are fundamentally the same	1
i found this course to be a useful overview of the role of the software product manager im looking forward to the rest of the courses in the specialization when they become available	4
i originally took this course at coppin state university in  i missed a week and decided to withdraw glad i decided to retake this course	4
great course the final exam is very odd though the correct answers didnt fit easily in what was taught several subjective questions	3
while the course is definitely very good and thorough the difficulty of each week is raising exponentially first just learn one chord shape then learn some picking techniques then a small set of obscure and rarely used scales and then suddenly a huge bunch of open chords movable chords power chords and a song too of course you got to play it all sounding nice and even like a metronome or your peers will pull your score down heavy maybe im not the most gifted guitarist but i really felt like the learning curve here was just unfairly steep im still giving the course  stars because the material is still really good but if you are beginner be prepared to take it twice	3
very clear instructions and with great assignments to make you thoroughly understand the materials through practice	4
the content is great but it would be great to have a booklet or something writing in addition because the teacher style is very much conversational	3
the course is fine explanations and videos are a bit hard to follow at timesthe final assessment is in my opinion very bad as it i appears to me quite unrelated to the course it self the lectures are quite abstract and the exam is a practical application of the conceptthe instructions of the course also arent very good as you need to do each part of the final project at the end of each weeki would strongly suggest to not take this course unless you have many spare hours	2
the course is an introduction to the absolute basics of python programming assignments are not very challenging and the course could benefit by adding more content and challenging tasks for those who wish to challenge themselves	1
great content delivered at a solid pace	3
very basic for novices not worth it to pay money for it	0
great  im an it guy learning a lot about math 	4
brief overview of the topic but well presented thanks to the teacher the university and coursera	3
the weekly lecturesassignments did little to prepare for the final assignment they were short and high level without any coding to back them upit is possible to blaze through the first four weeks in a couple hoursand then spend weeks on the final assignment because you will need to learn most of it on your own by looking through api documentationto the instructors if you want to see what a good intro to language course looks like checkouthttpswwwcourseraorgcourseprogramming	0
i would like the course to be more dynamic	1
i liked the course because it allowed me to complete it in my own time the material was well documented i would have liked to have my questions answered in realtime and interactively maybe to others taking the course there were some quiz questions that didnt reflect the material in the course so i got lost and had to find my own answers on the internet overalli would recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn medical terminology	3
overall i enjoyed this course and got a broad overview of the various technologies used in big data analysis the course is video heavy but short on practice there are  assignments the first  weeks then week is an endless series of videos i really enjoyed the assignments but felt there should have been more assessmentpractice provided there are no quizzes to reinforce understanding the readings provided are mostly academic ones which arent that clear to beginners even to programmers like mein contrast a python data science course on another mooc platform has  times as much content with practice exercises after every video mid and final exams weekly problem sets as well as readingsultimately the course showed me what i need to learn next to get into data science but the first course hasnt given me confidence that the rest of the specialization will be worth the money	2
this coarse dont worth  bucks at all	1
lots of bugs	0
overall the videos related to the quizzes are to vague and un detailed i more often than not feel lostalso this should not be part of the interaction design specialisation and just be a small part of another coursenot once have i needed r or statistic in my  year design career	0
very good and useful course	4
accurate  but very basic information	2
excellent course easy to understand and very well paced would suggest everyone to take this course not much of knowledge in coding is required and anyone can do the assignments	3
great first starter but poorly done	1
content and quizz are not alignedmentors answer to  of the forum postspoor student communitydo not pay for this course just follow the swirl andor get some tuto about regressions	0
good paced exercises	3
i really liked this coursealthough i am not a lawyer and more environmental engineer the professor explain different environmental law cases waste soil water air in an easygoing manner it was simple but very strong content recommendable	4
not really a beginner course i had to complement this course with other js open source courses only to realise js is really huge additionally the course requires prior knowledge about html and css as well and it does not seem to be up to date with newest language versions such as html and css	2
the lecture videos are not super helpful and the instruction and support for final project is somewhat lacking you need a relatively solid background coming into doing the project beforehand just study the course material is not enough for you to complete your final project in fact you need peer help or to read more materials to fully understand and finish the project the quizzes compared to what is asked in the project is too simple and thus not constructive enough in the overall learning overall i would recommend you to have a solid background before proceed with this course if you want to improve your learning experiences	1
the course was in he sense truly introduction to big data domain and discusses the origin and reason big data technologies are requiredthe only improvement i would like to suggest is raise the difficulty level of quizso that they motivate student to review and understand the key points discussed during tutorial	4
terribly difficult to engage with  min lectures in every lesson plus unorganized presentations and interviews making extracting important information difficult the lack of organization in the interview videos which are super long made it very difficult to extract significant information for the course and assignements i will say that the research and academic readings made available in the course were exceptionally helpful and full of great information i just wished that that information was presented in a more engaging and interesting way sometimes more organized as well furthermore much of the referenced material should be made accessible within the course rather than simply cited it looks fascinating but from places like china databases and websites with such relevant sources are often wholly inaccessible please include links or entire documents	1
not very useful	2
good introduction and definitely helps get started given we have video lectures concepts could have been explained better by demonstrating on the r console instead of showing static slides and verbal explanation	2
a lot of things ruby version controls phantomjs installation from this course dont work on mac os x el capitan	0
the course content is good but it needs some polishingmajor commentthe assignment submissionreview process should be improved grading system is not clearly defined at the time of submission some grading question are inherently subjective is the code at least somewhat efficient but even for inherently objective questions is the code correct as does it give the correct answer the staff does not provide the correct answer i think the staff should create some automated review for what is objective does the code compile does it yield the correct answer is it efficient enough just like many other courses on coursera and only when it passes the automatic review use peer grading for coding style finally there a lot of confusion with the deadlinesminor commentslucky coursera has an option to play twice faster not that the content is too easy but the talking  pace  is  hum very   slow also how come for a programming course the slides with code are so poorly formated	2
the lecture  interview approach brings diversity and different views on the table the topic of the mooc is actually quite simple and its its simplicity that makes it so important  first thought for the large majority of entrepreneurs should be to raise money by their own means ie building a sellable product and finance the business through customers the fact that it isnt so nowadays is the reason for so many failures and its also why this course is so relevant	3
assignments do not correspond with video lessonsvideo lessons has a lot of teorical concepts that are not usefull at alltheres a big opportunity to enhace this course	1
the course content is presented in a very good way it is explained in an understandable way and examples provide a good insight the final assignment is ambiguously described this is very frustrating if you invest a lot of time and recognize that all classmates proceeded in a different way	0
its not a bad course but it forces students to use graphlab a framework created by one the professors teaching the course instead of using scikitlearn a widely used framework for machine learning in python	2
this is a good introductory course to some of the tools but it doesnt go into the details of r programming or data science	2
i liked the assignment and the course for the most part what i didnt care for was so much time being spent on the ibm bluemix and other software tutorials i dont really see the value in those software and it felt very sales pitchy i cant imagine using them in my day to day so it just felt like a waste of time but i did like all other aspects of this course including the taco bell insight as well as the details on social mention and the other free web applications that is more pertinent to future social work	2
coursera stands for its rich courses this one is an exception one of the worst ive ever seen so far its like reading a bad inspirational book no system no methods in place	0
me parece un muy buen curso pero me parece que de igual forma se deberían enfocar a como se deben citar los autores que se consultan para disminuir el plagio	3
the guy is full of shit hes just trying to sell you his book and his online game product he was also obsessed with bragging about all of his accomplishments i was quite disgusted by him at the end i paid for the certification but now i want my money back	0
super interesting but it is a very basic introduction to nutrition only the first or second lessons have information about nutrients and how they are different from each other the other sections you couldve gotten from a michael pollan book or one of his documentaries nevertheless very engaging visually and verbally and ideal for someone who is getting started on nutrition	2
excellently delivered high clarity and focus on concepts	4
the course goes over the basic toolkit for data scientists overall it seemed too easy and maybe a bit simplistic i was expecting more there was a lot of optional reading made available in week  perhaps some optional assignmentsquizzes related to that reading could be added to the course	2
got lost and left behind very quickly even after watching videos numerous times and doing additional research there were videos missing even with deadlines approaching some videos were very well explained while others i didnt understand at all	0
the course comes with great explanation but the graded assignments sometimes seem pointless as they look irrelevant to the topic there are unnecessary questions asked in quizzes ie whether you have completed your assignment or not these sort of questions never evaluate what we have accomplished	3
the lectures provided an excellent overview to bitcoin technology its place in the world and the potential of cryptocurrencybased approaches the assignments were more technically challenging requiring some knowledge of java programming and data structures and requiring some extra thought on the algorithms for the highest marksthe assignments might be made more accessible if they were integrated more systematically with the lecture concepts but nevertheless the end result is a very impressive and useful course	4
after completing the machine learning course and after going through all of these videos and assignments now i can say that i have learnt a lot from this course and content of the course have good quality and helps you expertise this field thanks a ton prof andrew ng	4
overlyremedial information but that is not what earns this course such a poor evaluation from me the poor evaluation comes from the composition of the review quizzes the endofsection quizzes ask questions to which there can be more than one correct answer yet only a single response will receive creditexample a recommended solution to a problem is valued by an executive because followed by four possible answers one of which is clearly incorrect while one makes an awful assumption these two choices can be eliminated easily however the final two options are both unarguably correct but only one was briefly mentioned in the material reading or video and thus only that one receives creditunfortunately this demonstrates the course creators desire to value a students memorization of the instructors own unique words over the students assimilation of the course content and ideascoursetakers beware this course seems more tailored to stroking ms bravos ego than to you actually learning anything of commercial value	0
very nice course active forum no issues technical or otherwise but it is more about science than philosophy	2
good course but slow each video was quite long with the same concept repeated few times	2
the peer reviewed assignments are next to useless as there is no oversight on them i think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first before allowing fellow learners the ability to passfail students in the course	0
the importance of this course is huge however i did miss better explanation from some topics	2
very little relationship between lectures and assignments was expected more practices	2
 out of a waste of time if i cannot participate in discussions forums submit assignments or give reviews i might as well watch youtube lecturesthe course content was very poor as well this is based on the unpaid materialthis course should be scrapped and not offered as an unpaid course its a classical case of bait and switch	1
the instructor is about as convoluted as you can possibly get with his explanations	0
the course is very interesting but there is a problem with the quizzes it doesnt accept correct questions if needed i can provide a screen shot of the problem in one of the quizzes hope that all this will be fixed and ill be able to take the course again	0
this course is about nothing it is poor illustrated and uninformative the lecturers manner is anno	0
are you a struggling programmer someone who doesnt know how to install software via command line not experienced with github if any of those describe you then this is not the course for you the professors seem to create an environment where if you are too new to anything then you should take a different courseeven though every module has introduction to  in the title does coursera offer introductory courses to ruby or ruby on rails other than this introduction course no	0
very poor course you can pass it in a one day even if you never program python	0
this course has a lot to do with math and statistics and i find it really hard to follow especially when it comes to the final project	2
this is a great course	4
really good explanation of iot and ar this course gave me a basic knowledge of all those things	3
a good starting point to ancient philosophy 	3
the flash tutorials are helpful instructor quality is low production quality of instructor videos is low not on par with the university of virginia project management course pace of course is also extremely slow though it may be appropriate for novice students that should be made clear upfront in the course description	1
for me too much graded questions  but in generall the course is good	2
i learnt basic of big data exicited to dive deepervery informative and engaging	3
personally felt this course have a lot more potential the explanations in the lectures felt very robotic especially when describing the scripts at times the lectures slides felt like displaying the subtitles and reading off them a lot more diagrams could have been illustrated for explanations i have to watch other videos in youtube to get a better grasp of the conceptsgood thing is that this is an introductory course and the codes are given	1
this python course was easy and simple to learn and use python on a daytoday basis	4
i have been quite disappointed by this class there were no suggested readings in addition to the quite basic videos but the worst were the quizzs  of the answers to the multiplechoice questions were the top option i could have pass the tests without having listen to the videos were those tests or jokes you should do this class only if you know absolutely nothing about economics because this is the most basic class	0
good course	3
i really enjoyed this course it reiterated my belief that if one has the passion and perseverance there is no limit to learning the faculty were amazing the interviews and extra reading material were	4
week  of the course seemed very interesting a lot of interesting questions were raised  enough to lead me to view the course in a rather positive light as i progressed through the course however i noticed that some rather contentious claims were made to seem to have more credibility than they in fact do take for example something that was said in week  lesson  it was insinuated that lamarckism plays a significant role in evolutionary biology something that is widely questioned by eminent specialists in evolutionary biology for ex jerry coynefurthermore it sometimes seemed that rather than presenting the facts for the learners to judge the lecturers were presenting their own views this was especially the case in week this course is being funded by templeton foundation an organization that promotes religious apologetics it seems that rather than presenting facts as they are the course is disseminating material deeply influenced by a religious agenda	2
although the topics are great and very interesting especially because i am a teacher who face many of the situations mentiones the videos are very hard to understand and i needed to put subscribe all the time	1
this required nearly no effort and is probably of little value in the real world	0
hated the course and the content i truly regret investing my money on this course	0
this is not the entrepreneurship primer i was hoping for but it did a tremendous job of educating me on the different ways in which public and private partnerships can potentially spur the growth of entrepreneurship in a region if utilized effectively	3
this was a very good course for learning vocabulary and grammar for use in conversation with friends the video clips of students participating in dialogue meant there were many examples of hearing pronunciation of korean by different people	4
very intense course	3
this course is very useful especially for the beginners it creates the fundament for your future study the practical part is very interesting and gave students the opportunity to try different aspects of graphic design thank you coursera and calarts	4
excellent course gives an in depth understanding of market research and consumer behavior	4
week  was particularly tough to get through instructor seem uninterested and the constant hair flipping was distracting videos came through blurry despite using high quality settings there was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized on a few occasions i had to backtrack through the videos to find something i missed and in one area instructor had to go back and fix something but didnt bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself in the end i gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research	1
i would have liked better tools to do this type of work	2
the ml foundations course provides a good overview of the other courses in the specialization it also provides a good introduction to graphlab	3
tutor is russian i guess her accent is not quite understandable	1
incredible lectures one of the best courses on the site	4
succinct relevant  lively coverage of topics  rating couldnt be given in the absence of certificate frankly issuing a certificate doesnt seem a lot of work	2
interesting sometimes a little bit overwhelmed by a lot of information within a single video but it gives you an overview of what is big data modeling and management systems	3
not what i thought it would be based on the intro	0
not a class for the beginning programmer the lectures do not line up with the assignments and if you dont have programming experience you could easily spend  hoursweek figuring out how to finish the assignments	0
assignments are challenging but some questions are very vague and require lots of trial and error guesswork to get the autograder to accept them	2
the course structure was well formatted the order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive the follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the studenthowever there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course this made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries it was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct it would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set providedfinally i think this course would be better split into two parts the first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries the main audience would be analystdata professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data the second part of the course would be more useful to dbas or professionals that have database admin privileges to insertdeletemodify data i would also focus more heavily on database schemas in this second course relative to the first	2
course material looked sometimes recycled and unstructered	2
not much substance to this course	1
not really about product management but about project management	1
they could have stated the audience of the course more clearly i found most of the information irrelevant that added little value most of the things discussed are generic and would apply to any project	1
no substantive knowledge at all	1
i really loved how interested the teachers and instructors were in teaching us if they can give out knowledge with that interest i can take it in with the same level of interest 	4
the tutorials is not for average students it takes a very high skill to understand them  also the quiz nd the assignments r too toughhope you can make them a bit easy the last one ie with graphs and trees was a bouncer if the maths required is so high please take a week to first explain the math fresher required in course and then start the main course	0
too easy	0
good course but need to pay for tests	2
need more understandable subtitles peerreview for this course is not a good idea as well given abstract concepts and different language	0
this specialization is delayed for months now  very annoying dont give them money	0
its very straightforward	2
course was good but i thought more could of been added to the content to make more understandable for ex videos	3
its a good course but not very exceptional	2
i miss the slides for static consulting alter the vídeo	2
the format of the course is not very engaging the instructor shows slides with generic statements and then reads them slowly the case studies are quite artificial and the answers are too obvious i was expecting more tricks how to apply this in practice	1
the subject matter for this course is very very interesting the professor does a nice job of layering the complexity from basic concepts to more advanced concepts however this is where the good news ends the course is full of all sorts of calculation errors on the graded quizes	0
the topic of capstone is great but the milestones and their apis direct towards bad solutions	2
the course listed updated businesses in digital world and exploited the basic concepts it is very useful as an introductory course for one who are not familiar with digital business	4
its an awesome course to learn machine learning a big thank you to andrew ng	4
the course is not for beginners and winform lovers this is real rebranding yourself i would say path to reborn to what real open source world is living in low or no help from course instructor community or google course comes in huge amount of concentrated videos  hardest assignments i would give up on the beginning but commitment is top of all i respect anyone who has completed	1
this course had almost no lectures it was almost all done in downloadable pdfs that were rarely discussed in the lectures i never learned why anything happened	0
would have liked some more examples for the explanation	3
for the amount of money one is paying for this product one would at least expect teacherstudent interaction the tests are too easy one cant learn properly from them	2
there should be lab or hands one calculation exercise	2
a course with a very good level of detail regarding every important aspect of the topic considering the amount of time required information presented in a clear way	4
quite good and interesting course i would probably add a bit more diversity is presentations tasks etc but even as it is now it gives a very good insight	3
only skims the surface of big data even for an introduction course	2
great informative class but way too many quizzes	3
it is a good introductory course it can be included an application project to practice the concepts learned in order to improve this course	2
course is somewhat efficient because the instructor is keep on reading the slides and nothing more than that thats it	2
lots of dry theory not as practical as i expected	2
just the basics no concrete explanations of models you have to study them on your own	1
doesnt provide resources to complete assignmentstelling students to go to stack overflow is a serious red flagindependent learning is an incredibly valuable process but this course felt more like a series of challenge assignments to do once youve learned pandas on your own from another source	1
unsyncronize subtitle with audio please fix thisimo i think the video must not too long below  minutesvideo so lecturer separated it to more segment and give popup quiz in video	1
if i can understand all of these derivatives why shall i attend your course it is not helpful course especially for persons looking for some practical econometrics applications rather than focusing on the mathematics side of it	0
the course is very practicallyoriented and the quizzes are actually designed so that the learner can make a strong emphasis on the weekly content	4
this class needs more content more explanation it is clearly a very important aspect of data science but the assignments were more complex than the given course content	1
the course brings lots of information but the assessments are not at all creative so it becomes a lot of theory with little practiceel curso trae mucha información pero las actividades no son ní un poco creativas entonces se converte en mucha teoria con poca practica	1
very useful method	4
this is a very bad course i wouldnt recommend it to anyone as it doesnt concern to any coding	0
great course about functional programming and scalathe lectures are well constructed and well explained with some exercises in between the sound is unfortunately sometimes low but i used headphones for thatthe assignments are challenging and help you deepen your knowledge effectively however the forum is not very lively you might not find it difficult to do assignments on your own i suggest to use stackoverflow in that caseit is not taught how to do debugging though this course is not meant for beginners i think and as such probably understanding and debugging a scala program might be expected to be learned autonomously	3
the capstone project doesnt fully utilise d knowledge from earlier modules such as machine learning statistical analysis regression models n etc	1
prof sachs takes us through a very interesting and engaging course on the need for sustainable development it is simple in most parts while i enjoyed the number crunching questions in the quiz i can imagine that it is not for everyone it is extremely informative and i have filled up a notebook with my notes from all of the  lecturesjust taking a star away for some of the links or course material not being updated for instance the links to external websites are not valid any more also the actual sdgs are different from the ones in the lecture as the ones in the lecture were proposed as against the current actual ones	3
very basic course without much in depth explanations or insightful matteri hope this course is worth the money i paid im starting to regret paying for this	1
it gives a quick background on galaxy and its softwares content is appropriate but does not prepare you for even the final assignment or real genomic problems	0
great course but light on the mathematical part would love to get those insights	3
fastpaced course requiring time to finish  but totally worth it	4
i thought it was free i might was well go to google to learn android development	0
course is very high level and teacher inspiring as i highlighted already it took me  hours with a professional to install pentaho for what to explain pivot tables totals that is very unecessary also from europe virtual machine use is just killing my computer and i end up spending more time crashing and restarting my pc than working on the course and i am surrounded by it professionals in my company for reference this is sadly a big let down for an excellent course theory wise	0
overall the course had a good mix of depth and breadth there should be examples in the presentations and notebooks to help drive home the concepts better	3
great course prof danny chamovitz is a very good teacher and i feel that now i know much more about plant and life in general thank you for the course	4
the teacher speaks very fast and provides the material not deep	2
i didnt like it its all theoretical and there isnt any practicealso they didnt send me an accomplishment like the other courses that i already done	0
im dropping this course because its just so poorly conceived three weeks in and i cant really articulate what ive actually learned which leads me to believe that the answer is not very much the major problem is that this course has no clear objective and i dont mean that the individual lessons dont have objectives  i actually mean that the entire course doesnt know what it wants to be and the instructors seem to have bypassed this critical question i have a background in python and i was under the impression that this course would teach me how to program in swift seems like a fairly straightforward goal but it isnt that at all if i were to summarize this course perhaps a little uncharitably because im annoyed at the time i wasted it would be some dudes with a computer talk about some cool features of a programming language im fairly baffled by the fact that there was no thought put into which examples might best illustrate the features they were trying to teach whichexamplesmightbestillustratethefeatureiamtryingtoteach is pedagogy  they would regularly work through examples just to conclude actually thats a bad example this is pretty strong evidence that there was no lesson planning involved there were also no practice exercises no posting of pieces of illustrative code and hence no way to actually get good at programming in swift unless its self directed in which case  why bother with the formality of taking a course on coursera	0
presents a useful analysis framework but with limited practical examples to learn how to use analytical tools	2
much better courses are available for free on udacity and edx this is only a money making course concepts used are very old nothing new in this course one can dwell in pid controllers for life its a huge are and the way its used here is totally ancient its just some ancient methods in new quadcopters	1
admittedly some topics especially neural signaling could be explained so much more simply professor white sometimes picks the most random starting points to explain a new topic rather than explaining the subject matter in a point apoint b manner other times there are other topics where information is omitted in an attempt to not overcomplicate the subject although sometimes that omitted information could have easily helped to explain what the professor was talking aboutthat said this is an incredibly thorough clear yet manageable course this course has the handsdown best resources lecture notes clinical case studies interactive anatomy program and a separate website of any coursera class ive taken ive learned more from this class than any single class ive taken on coursera or in college hats off and big thanks to professor white ellen vos and everyone involved in this course	4
this course is really hard and i am having alot trouble understanding it overall it is not one of the best courses i have taken	1
the course was too short and did not provide any reading materialit would be more helpful to have more and shorter quizzes	1
not quite what i expected more on the role of the interviewer than the actual design of questionnaires	2
a very interesting course focus on the true life with data science teams this course is more about the day to day life and problem to manage a data science team and less about pure organization the financial aspects are not covered by jeff nor the complex problems of people organization i have noticed that i was the sole person to post on the forum	3
being honest the lessons in the course are disconnected with the weekly tests specially for the final exam professor daniel egger and his assistan must improve the lessons including examples step by step specially for the multiple linear regression su	0
not sure this should be a course that is charged on to the next one now	1
the class has great concept but it needs a bit more structure and change to hit its full potentialthe goodthe spreadsheets and exercises along with quiz material the project was also very informativethe bad the video need to better explain how area under curve and how the credit model make sense it was not very intuitive and i struggled for over  weeks to put the project together due to this gapbut a worthwhile class with great potential i am glad i took it	2
with all due respect to the lecturer its obvious that he is intelligent and an expert on the subject i found this lesson not easy to participate because of inordinate learning curve and fast accent	0
the content is definitely interesting but i didnt see any practice there i didnt really get the difference theory vs practice between this course and the previous one digital analytics for marketing professionals marketing analytics in theorysometimes the assignments were not very interesting and didnt always help practicing the content exposed in the lectures for example the piece about the different statistical tools i didnt get why it was included in the course either we do exercises on it or it shouldnt be in the course but there is not point of knowing by heart the differences between the different statistical toolsthe part about the customer decision journey the plan for analytics and the different analysis techniques were very interesting i would have liked to see and practice more concretely how to collect data eg how to perform clickstream analysis etcand the lectures should avoid general tips and guidelines like  things to avoid in order to the web is full of this kind of content i mean it has to be in practice and the professor should know exactly the content of his slides and prepare his speechlastly a lot of the suggested readings were from a blog that is really horrible to read the author of the blog might be very knowledgeable on his subject but his blog it is full of useless jokes very long to read i mean one of its articles could  times shorter if he gets straight to the point	2
it was a good course but maybe you should include more activities for reforcing the knowledge	3
if i could give this course a lower score i would it was not helpful at all i ended up having to take another course so i could actually complete my website	0
very theoretical and mathematical and not enough real examples	1
no need for videos if all the teacher does is reading his slides	0
really helpful very interesting especially the focus on evidence based interventions is going to be really helpful at working with people with asd as i worked with adults with asd i found it very good that this group was referred to too not only children with asd i really enjoyed the course thank you	4
useful interesting and important course of high quality to recommend	4
the course is more an exercise in flexing ivy vernacular than it is actually teaching the learning curve is too steep to be useful to the majority of potential registrants youre interested in this course either to a learn something about an exciting and ever changing field andor b to have the stanford logo on your linkedin profile in both cases move on the curve is far too steep to be useful or to merit the countless additional hours of background learning the course should have done to bridge the gap	0
some of the content are repetitive the first interview sounds staged some korean reference noon sei or something like that  are nonvalue adding	1
thank you	4
this was a great introduction to data science it provides an overview of the science in general and the course provides all the tools needed to move forward	4
this course is not precisely bad but its very lacking compared to the other courses in the specialization here are my complaintsmuch of the more interesting bits say check out this other course in bioinformatics for details of course if you arent registered for that other course you dont have access to those materialsnot a lot of thought went into the homeworks all of them are implement this here is some pseudocode with no think about a problem that can be solved with the same ideas like the other courses in the specialization which are in my opinion much betterwe saw  algorithms for string matching kmp rabinkarp suffix array matching burrowwheelers transform but virtually no discussion on when to use each one strengths and weaknesses and so on also no boyermooreafter passing all test cases for a homework we should be able to download a solution with the correct implementation in order to improve our own	1
though i had moderate knowledge of coding before hand arduino a bit of c a bit of js this course slid me into the world of python and clarified some things i had not known before great course i would recommend to anyone looking to learn python or coding in general	3
this course is very useful for first learning koreani have learned the meaning korean alphabet through first week sessionfirstly we know korean alphabets history it helps us understand korean easily	3
this course gives good perspective on innovation process and how to bring idea to life however it was disappointing to me that content of the course has nothing to do with art and culture	0
the videos did cover the basic theories behind all the methods for portfolio management however they were just basic theories with no explanation on how to practically implement them and then asking us who only understand the theories from the videos to suddenly try to solve the calculation quizzes especially those excel calculations without any practice on how to implement them beforehand besides the videos only showed the formulas with no example at all very disappointed with the course this course is not recommended for those who have zero or little experience in the field	1
easy to understand and follow good pace of lectures	2
very tough to catch up	0
unable to download certain materials and no spontaneous reply was made	1
a first year undergraduate student can pass this	1
not what i expected	0
love the lectures and the way everything is organized in the course however the information or instructions provided by the labs seem incomplete	3
during this course i had many issues with bower and version conflicts i do everything step by step like in the video and nothing works i look at error log and realize there is some issue with versions it would be really nice if you explained how to deal with it instead of making me waste hours of my time on googling this stuff it almost made me quit using bower forever	2
i thought this course was very disappointing to the point where im not able to finish it in week one we learned some basics in week two the entire language was dumped on us with no real exercises then we were asked to write some programs the programs didnt build knowledge piece by piece  it was just learn the language now write these random programs it was very disappointing i sign up for courses because i want to learn piece by piece and get to practice each new thing if someone is going to dump the whole of ruby on me in  week i dont need the class i can buy a book and get the same experience there also wasnt a good grader provided this really took the joy out of programming i keep thinking ill come back and finish the class but i havent so far because i dislike how its presented so much a true disappointment	0
it can be made more informative on theory side the course is bit fast i guess or may be all the courses are like this only since this is my first course but still i feel like things are going bit fast because i was not having any previous knowledge of data statistics or r language however giving some efforts on both sides i am happy with my performance thanks for the course	2
great training using a terrific dataset learned some best practices and frameworks too	3
very useful	3
it is not worth 	2
very helpful tips	4
great course	3
articulation needs to be improved talked too fast content doesnt give much	1
i thought this course was top notch  the lectures were very well designed and course production quality was first rate an excellent introduction to an important subject area	4
really comfortable with the beginners like me	4
i already had done a digital logic course before but this course is different from that as it is much more formal in describing a digital system in this courses the emphasis is on systems which is much welcome the processor topic is very interestingalthough the videos could be made a little better the content is interesting but the presentation is a little dulli write this review after  weeks into the course and i personally am enjoying it	3
this is so out of date that half of the information is irrelevant	0
average doesnt really like the professors style he spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc i feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject i would have prefer a more historical approach overall ive watched all the content but in the future i wont spend much time checking for new mooc from him thanks for the try though	2
theres not much substance also considering there is not video the course seems very noninteractive its nice to see the instructors speak and work through examples hoping this course was just a quick primer for the r newbies	1
poor feedback and advice with those who really do not know of programming to shame	0
too general course didnt learn much from it	0
some things are useful such as the table task list but i would say there isnt enough of this type of help it would be better if there were more tables like thatalso more information and help is needed on how to accomplish multitasking unfortunately multitasking is necessary in many environments from office to home and even a housewife has to multitask one of the most important aspects of multitasking that was not covered and that is really needed is how to multitask in a situation of housewife type of work examples of this include engineering molecular biology chemistry work in a lab in general etc you constantly need like a housewife put something for a chemical reaction or start laundry or put a cake in the oven and then you have to wait for the chemical reaction to occur and during that time when you wait you need to keep this ongoing laundry task in your head so that you dont forget to take it out later on time and when there are more than  tasks like that and they all have this pick me up and start on me later thing they are all in your head and they take up all your memory and resources and the worst part is its difficult to schedule them because you need to schedule not how long will something take not in a linear fashion but how long will multiple parallel things take i would really appreciate it if there was something about this topic in a time management course	1
interesting review of many of the theoretical aspects it completely lacks practice though no exercises no real world scenarios	2
the course is highly theoretical only good for coming to know the terms that are in use in the industry and their meanings very little take away from a practical perspective some live example or a case study to be incorporated where the students can apply the principles first hand	1
outstanding course	3
good but overemphasizes niche software product graphlab	2
i was expecting the capstone to be different than what it ended being i didnt find it as practical and beneficial as the other courses	1
awesome course so clearly explained	4
peer review assignments are too handheld making the assignments themselves worthless	0
lessons on html and css are very good better than other coursera classes so i suggest you to give a look at those in general the teacher is very good even though i found the javascript part less deepen a week and partially the last week are dedicated to the construction of a restaturant site unfortunately the student role is pretty passive youll just look the teacher at work youll not build a site in this course i skipped much of those lessons but the most disappointing point is for me the excessive simplicity of the assignments the assignments are the primary reason why i decided to take a mooc instaed of simply reading a book i expected much interesting assignments and much more practice	2
very good course	4
very good course for does how just starting with ableton	4
i really like the content of this course and the quality of the readings the videos are intuitive and help you go through the most important concepts i definitely recommend it and big thank you to the teachers that delivered high standard course	3
unlike the html course which precedes it this course was lacking information and structure	1
great course  thank you for taking the time to make these courses it has helped me advance my working life	4
very nice content and very well explained examples are good too	4
good introduction with practiceunfortunately no certificate of accomplishment is available this makes the coursera platform less interesting	3
very difficult to follow if you are not a programmer	2
i only received  as a final result even though i obtained  for every assignment pathetic rating system if i had paid for this course i would be incensed	0
the course would be great if only everybody could fully participate as i cannot pass quizzes and submit assignments not having purchased it i have less motivation to carry on 	2
good quality information excellent instructor	3
no significant instructionteaching provided appears to function only as a selfdirected workshop which doesnt teach the craft itself disappointing	0
this is a great course one of the better ones in the series	4
its very good for beginners	2
recommend to improve assignment details	3
some latter sections felt as if they were not shot in sequence thus disrupting the flow this fact notwithstandingthe program is an overall a good overview of the platform	3
course has not been updated wrong answers in quiz eg week  quiz on progressivity videos getting blocked at review question point etc i am checking out	0
swirl package contents were better than the lectures in the videos the video lectures introduced concepts without any context making them difficult to understand the video lectures also didnt demonstrate anything the swirl package was much better at showing one doing one	1
perfectly done dynamic manageable with sense of humor	4
i am a very frustrated learner trying to write a constructive review here i studied the course full time to get a certificate to put in my profile r programming is considered nearly essential skill if not fundamental to data analysis so i had high hopes going into this courselecture videos i cannot begin to tell you how many times i fell asleep watching the video lectures this course is for you if you like listening to someone talking through pages and pages of copypaste text from a command prompt i on the other hand prefer learning by doing sadly all the doing is clumped into the assignments more on them later also dr peng makes gross burpingdrooling noises in the video from time to time i apologize if that sounded rude but try listening to the lectures with headphones and youll say the same video editing for prerecorded videos is not rocket scienceassignments these were the biggest frustration throughout the course imagine you want to learn to play the piano and you play a little guitar now and you go to the piano class your piano teacher talks your ears off with music theory for several hours and then hangs you out to dry in front of an audience in a concert hall you protest but i have no clue of how to play but your teacher says all the piano greats learned by fiddling around with a hacker mentality you ask why did i pay  to hack on my ownofflecture help if you take the course for the same reason i did then thank your favorite god for the moderators in the discussion forums mentors  out of the  stars i give belongs solely to them and the fantastic work they do the stickied posts in the forums offer a bit of help with the assignments not enough but still something and they are also active in answering questions the other star in my review goes to swirl you will learn way more by doing the swirl exercises than watching the lectures by a long wayin conclusion i finished the course with nothing more than a rudimentary understanding of r despite the fine grades very little thought seems to have been put into the lectures i would recommend this only if you want to show this certificate to someone otherwise stay away	1
this course is acceptable for basic practices highly recommended for those who want to take first dip into the marketing analytics world	3
fun and useful	2
if you have to pay for the certificate itself then the course cant be too serious or maybe even that much helpful	0
it is very well designed for total beginner of programming but if you learned any language already it is too too too easy	1
the course is very disappointing and useless the two lecturers are not explaining anything properly they are just showing slides and handing out linksthe only useful part of the course is module  which is outside the scope of the course and taught by guest lecturersi would not spend time on this course and instead find another source for learning wordpress	0
very neat course i really recommend it for these who start with pythonor just want to remind themselves such topics	3
the course gives a perfect introduction to the field of cybersecurity	3
this is a part of the data specialization from afar i would not be interested in machine learning because of this course i will seek other methods to learn	1
some good concepts and stories but lacking in specific techniques	1
the course covers the basic foundations of behavioral finance especially prospect theory and various cognitive biases that negatively influence our decision making in financial affairsthe topics covered are definitely very interesting and the lecturers frequently prove that they know what they are talking about and explain some topics in adequate depth and breadthfor a valuable coursera course i am expecting that most of the material is covered with video lectures otherwise i read a book on that matter and i am expecting thoughtthrough slides with clear definitions clear practical examples and exercises and the presentation of experimental proofs for the given statementsregrettably most of this course is comprised of simple slides with limited structuring as definitions exercises and proofs are often intermingled more importantly only a very limited subset of the course is covered with the suitable and valuable video lecturesespecially the last of the threeweek course consist mostly of reading material from an external websitethe exercises after each of the three weeks are at the lower end of what i have seen on coursera and the lecturers should consider putting more effort in creating useful questions for formative and summative evaluations of the learning progressin summary smart lecturers present a very interesting and highly relevant topic but they put to little effort in creating a compellingly online course	1
felt like it was a bit rushed and some of these concepts like dijkstra definitely deserve a lot more attention	2
the course was very limited it should have been combined with introduction to r	2
this is a nice effort and it obvious how hard everyone has worked there are too many presumptions presented as facts though and too much certainty about research issues that lots of debate is still going around so good work but unless the course is supposed to attract only ignorants and people that havent been in contact with science some of the instructors act a bit i know it all and that is how it is although noone does yet sorry to discover this spirit in here	0
very common rf knowledge and less deeper knowledge than expected its an high level introduction but definitely no specialisationonly the lte part is much better and in more detail right nowbtw i dont like presentations with reading only the visible content we all can read by our self more spoken details between the lines would be nice	2
translation from english only on the first slides i thought it at all lectures spent a lot of time beginning to study	0
i am very interested in this topic however i found the instructors presentation to be so monotonic and slow paced that i dropped out i am sure he knows his material cold and i am sure that he is much better live in class the readings were appropriate and the course out line solid however this is not his media and i have done the talking to the camera thing and it can be deadly for presenters it is not btw an age thing i am older than he i am sure and do not ask that presentations be entertaining  just that they be engaging perhaps if coursera had lecturers present in front of small groups as great courses does it is unfortunate that as i understand it coursera doesnt offer a free look with the option to transfer ones fee to another course if unhappy hope this is constructive for both the lecturer and coursera	1
very hard to follow unless you have had a good deal of experience with programming i would not really recommend like the teachers ok but they all went through too much material way too fast and without proper explanation i will take other classes on programming and then come back to this one again later maybe	1
the  last weeks excellent but the two first to basic	2
videos seemed disjointed assignments were marked inconsistently did not find the subject interesting but the course did give useful insights into the industry	1
reasonable class about designing user interfaces not much about cybersecurity	1
very bad way of teaching and not reach content	0
thank you so much i have learn so much	4
it was very good i could have a good understanding about the course	3
this course is not meant to stand alone as a single course rather is a portion of a larger agile development course im sure the information included is very informative but it references information that was included in other courses the first lessons start with diagrams that are not explained and terms that are not defined which i presume were probably covered in the first course also plenty of references to information from other courses previously we learned remember the exampledropped the course not that i didnt understand it but rather it was not worth my time to play catchup on my own suggest removing this course as a freestanding course or revising to allow the datalectures to stand on their own	1
assignments do not match up well with the lessons and the lessons are bad they are not educational	0
the peer review was a waste of time some individuals submit whatever other review whatever i found that the assessment criteria is not based on evaluating the quality of performed work and therefore have not really learned much from the capstone project i am taking another course which as well has peer review i am rethinking if its worth it do not see any value there is no real feedback from instructor if i need it a peer review i could just ask my colleagues at work	0
very little useful information more like pr for pwc	0
it is good for any greenhand in game the	3
very interesting	4
very poor content everything is already said in last courses in this specialization also they didnt gave any techniques or tips how to easier create game worlds	1
the last peer review is really hard to do hard is because the wording is very ambiguous and not all understand how to review there was a guy who answered with sql query this is hardcore since we have not learned that yet	0
provides a nice basis in understanding how economic principles are used to investigate agriculture production could provide a bit more of an economic foundation but the course is broad rather than deep	2
i think this course could be much better without jack wu laughing every few seconds i would except more professional approach and not videos likely taken on first shot with errors	1
not for beginners unless ready to spend lots of extra hours watching the videos several times and surfing on the web to get additional information	1
this course was so convoluted and not practical that it made me lose complete interest in the specialization	0
the course is well structured and prof muppala presents it in an interesting way the range of technology covered was good and would be useful the capstone project timelines are not realistic at all  one has to start implementing almost from the word go the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and i think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course	2
grading by students concept is not  accurate no feedback from teachers material is not very easy explained	2
interesting course but the evaluation process should be reworked with weekly quizz to ensure that the main concepts have been understood and a different final exam which does not assume that you already had the opportunity to apply and reflect upon what you have learned	2
somehow this section is bit confusing or rather to say the content is not really enough to work alone not even to solve the assignments without example codes	2
this class presents very elementary information in the video lectures then it requires knowledge far beyond what is taught in the course to finish the final project	0
the videos are very static the content good but the course progresses in a rather slow waythe thick dutch accent and the lack of diversity in the speakers profile is rather paramounting but i have followed only the first three chapters	1
very informative course was great studying with profaric	3
could be more clear about how to calculate period and latency	1
this is a very simple brief and useful coursethe modules are short concise but do not go into lot of details is a good course to auditbrowse for free but may not be good enough against a verified option anyways paying for verified course is subject to personal value derivationwhile i had rated earlier for the above reasons before the course finished i am facing the exact same problem with this course as i faced with earlier coursethe grading process is badly constructed for final assignment in fact now i am learning from coursera staff that may be there are not enough students to grade my peer review assignmentso please do audit this course but do not be trapped in specializationcheers	1
very disappointed having coding assignments weekly would have been very helpful the quizzes often asked for information that was never presented in the lessons the instructors were never present in the forums to answer questions the final project asked us to do things that hadnt even been mentioned in the course materials i would not recommend this course to anyone the only reason it got  stars instead of  was because i did learn some swift	1
this course is simply awesome  dr chuck is the best 	4
good easy to understand with simple exercises lots of things are learnt but better be more interesting with more ways of presenting and showing	2
not that detailed stuff	2
first time i gave  star reason lecturers are terrible this deserves a report if there was adequate reporting system on coursera i had a feeling like i was watching professors from school for disabled and not an university   course material is actually decent but extremely badly presented sadly i enrolled into second course as well and hoping that one will be better so i wont have to go through refund hell	0
didnt learn much of anything at all the peer review system is lazy on the teachers part and half of my classmates couldnt even speak proper english let alone write it	0
im only rating this course  stars because its just too easy the information is good what there is of it and is presented well its just that the amount of effort needed to pass is minimalfor example the fifth week had fewer assignments than the previous weeks and the six week was only a quick reviewthe problem i have with these courses being so easy is that online courses already suffer from the widespread view that theyre not as valuable as a real inperson course so when yet another one of these online courses is incredibly easy to pass it only adds fuel to those peoples arguments and reduces the overall value of the certificate of completioni want my certificate to mean something please stop watering down these courses ditch the pay you pass mentality include more material to read make the tests longer and more difficult because as they are they dont even compare in difficulty to the junior college courses much less the university courses ive taken in the past	2
only fit for absolute morons and perfect ignorants no content value whatsoever i dont understand why coursera allowed this one to happen to be on the coursera website	0
this course is good but i think should it be split in two parts because of density of material presented	2
one of the most fun professors to watch who makes it very easy to follow with the course content	4
after having taken several data sciencerelated courses this course seems like a good introduction to python for data science applications not much actual data science is covered in the course however its more practicallyoriented in the sense that it deals with data preparation loading cleaning and merging data you dont get the luxury of the common perfectlyprepared csvfiles in this course which is a good thing	3
the course covered very interesting topics but it would have preferred more detailed explanation of pd controllers and especially how to choose the tuning constants	2
accessible introduction to basic learning techniques	2
topics were ok but the focus on r and no other tools is frustrating	2
great title of lection but their contents scarce	0
the content of the course is extremely useful however assignments need review as the exercises results have mistakes and they are not explained very well missing step by step guidance	1
good basic coverage on childrens fundamental rights the course could have benefitted from assignments being more consistently accurate to lessons as there are some gaps the last module i found the most interesting as it covers challenges to child rights in real time culturalsocial dilemmas	2
i found it very easy but if you do not know anything about autism i think you might would contribute from it	0
quit good but too easy	3
very good by the end of the course i felt prepared to take the exam	4
really great course	4
really excellent activities and explanations and examples i loved so much about it the content was excellent the time with students was excellent really greatthis makes me want to visit new york	4
best of coursera	4
another joyful python course from dr charles severance course were very dense there was no boring details give fundamentals rest of it depends interest of the student also thanks for bonus videos and interviews most of them are very inspiring i understand from drs courses that everyone seeing your job will enjoy if you enjoy by doing it thanks a lot	4
the video lectures were not on par with the in my opinion extremely demanding programming assignments id say some knowledge of advanced coding was required in order to complete the assignments or alternatively lots of time to learn by yourself on google and forums which wasnt really the point was it	1
very long assignment	2
the lectures for this course seem unorganized and often had poor audio the content covered in many lectures seemed off topic quiz questions would then focus on the off topic information making it confusing with regard to what material to focus on during a lecture do i focus on the proposed subject of the video or the many tangents about other topics this combined with the unorganized nature of videosjust winging it made the lectures distracting the lecture videos are full of code that simply does not work in the real world and help from staff takes literally days to getand not just over the weekend	1
an engaging instructor but i was hoping for something a little more indepth with more rounded guidance for personal brand development	2
great course i had a wonderful time during the course	4
i dropped out of this course twice is coz i found it absolutely dead it says positive psychology but it really look so much constraint to even watch the first  videos without falling asleep this is probably the worse course ive studied on coursera i have studied at least  courses on coursera of which i loved social psychology and criminal and i even paid for the certificates this course literally killed me the worst ever ive come across	0
given the nature of law courses a lot of reading there needs to be a great deal more written information on the lecture slides quotes from pieces of legislation judgements from various courts quotes from politicians etc need to be provided on the slides otherwise students are either left to search through the transcript which contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors or write what prof gearey is saying which means continuously stopping and starting the lectures to get it all down in short better lecture slides with more information on	2
i enjoyed this course very much had value i watch scandinavian tv and films from the us via netflix amazon and mhz choice via livestreaming in the future i would like more emphasis on recent or current scandinavian film including actors actresses cinematography techniques etc also the video lengths were fine but the presenters need to be trained and give more engaging lively presentations  a bit too classroom lecturish thank you	2
you can really feel the passion and experience the facilitators have on this opv subject even via the videos this course is a must for people interested to delve into opv especially as a starting point for research the course covers into detail almost from cradle to grave about opv and what i like most is that they highlighted a lot of previous and current experiments and research regarding opv some of the quizzes can be a bit challenging as a few of them require  to pass but all in all  stars for me congratulations on a course well done	4
the teach and assignment are not in line in difficulty levels	3
i liked the fact that the final tests need your code so if you do not understand what you have done you will fail 	3
it was really helpful  wish we get report on our submission thank you so much 	3
ive been to college so im not the target audience for this course but i was curious to see what would be covered and to learn more about colleges today i felt the course covered mostly simplistic obvious stuff and left out a lot that many students wonder aboutone topic that was covered was the different activities of professors i wished id known more about this when i started college of course i knew they did research but i thought they were primarily there to teach this is true at some colleges but at others the amount and quality of research can determine whether a professor gets to continue working there and reach tenure so teaching may not be the first priority for some professors students may find that chunks of courses are devoted to a professors research interests which could enrich or derail the course this could have been covered in more depthother things that could have been covered why some courses are so large and the function of recitation sections and graduate teaching fellows for those and smaller courses what a seminar is the existence of course reviews that can help with selecting classes and professors how to deal with not getting into a course you really need to take wait lists professorial overrides etc when prerequisite courses are really necessary and when theyre just recommended dropping courses grades how the college grading system works what happens when you fail a course academic probation earning honors campus codes of conduct greater freedom as with class attendance smoking and drinking rules harassment policies and disciplinary actions disciplinary probation expulsion good campus activities for shy students	2
this course needs no previous knowledge about the field the instructor takes you from the scratch	3
way too elementary	0
this seemed like a somewhat outdated course but did have a lot of basic info for people who want to make a game but havent given it much thought i also found the quizzes and review options frustration due to poorly worded questions and rating choices as well as the lack of a written feedback option besides comments some of the videos seem to kind of drag on a bit as well but overall it was still helpful for developing my game despite feeling like i didnt gain much new information	2
very well structured instructors presenting their knowledge eloquently and case studies are fascinating and provide useful knowledge	4
great really informative	3
this course really boost my confidence i am really thankful to my professor tamy chapman for the wonderful lecture the study materials and the lecture classes helps me to practice further once again thank you very much to my professor and the entire team behind the scene for this wonderful course	4
i dont recommend this course the lectures barely touch on the topics being taught you are expected to go learn on your own i learned more from the free khan academy than from this course it would have been worth more buying good literature on algorithms	0
this course is not as polished as most other courses on coursera they occasionally give examples that are too small to see in the video most of the quizes dealt with syntax i dont feel like any new skill was developed in taking it if you are interested in ios programming take the university of california irvine versions of this class	1
this is my second python course again materials and videos were easy to follow i recommend this course to everyone who want to learn python	4
it is hard to be constructive when you do have something brilliant to compare withthe very first thing to say is that the course is presented through poorly drawn cartoons for yearolds and ineffective lecture videos with little or no eye contact with the instructors the presentations are filled with strange icons and drawings appearing every here and there making not much of a professional impressionafter watching videos in just about  minutes after the lecture is over the retained information was always going to zero sometimes i had to rewind the video to retrieve the points they were trying to make or maybe i just didnt want to listen to them but it seems impossible due to the fact i am interested and i do finish every course on business writing i run into always with  final gradethe overall demeanor is not as professional as it has to be i recommend the designers to watch write professional emails with gerry landers by georgia tech and teach english now with dr shane dixon by arizona state university i do not normally remember the instructors names except for brilliant ones i do not remember the ones of this coursei do hope my criticism will eventually lead to a better experience for your students i apologize if i was overly direct and wordyregardsrafael	0
simple and educative	4
a very good starting to the journey to machine learning just one disappointment i was expecting the classification and clustering courses to start together but the specialization has been delayed by a long time now	4
too much theory and projects didnt related with real life problems	2
can be mprovised in terms of course content	2
poor concepts exposition with a bad teaching method	1
small introduction i was expecting some thing concrete	1
i learned eight lines of java code in four weeks and we never implemented any of it into a web application viz a script that actually runs in a live website read a book instead its cheaper takes about the same amount of time and you learn a lot more i gave it a star because one was the minimum it should be zero because it wasted my time	0
very frustrating and disappointing experience the lectures were hard to follow on many levels the enunciation was unclear and subtitles were often ofthepoint plus they coveredup the code lines that were being discussed the lecturer often failed to explain logical constructs that were being used despite the fact that the course should have been understandable with no r cranbioconductor experience the method arguments were either not explained or very vaguely mentioned which means applying them to new situations was unnecessarily complicated no feedback at all was offered from course organisersreps to anyone even after complains in discussion forum about quiz questions no feedback for solving the questionscorrect answers even after the deadline quiz questions required methods and logical constructs that were not explainedusedmentioned in the lectures one quiz lacked background information of what data needed to be used the info was available in the previous version of the course some quiz questions were biologically inaccurate ie confusing genestranscriptsexons	0
this course was effective in testing what was learned and in testing simple useful expressions words and sentences however i would have liked to learn chinese characters along with the pinyin as in china reading the characters is just as important as speaking also i believe the quizzes were a bit too simple there should have been more multiple choice answers to chose from more questions in general and even some pronunciation practice	2
entertaining course and very easy to follow	3
very basic stuff	1
i learned a lot about bootstrap in this course	3
this is awesome thank you coursera and profs at wharton school d	4
straight and narrow	2
good for what it is but i was hoping for something more advanced on the algorithmprogramming side	3
the material isnt bad and it does provide some interesting prompts to think and write about but the curriculum is not at all creative it focuses on easily teachable and repeatable lessons that teach a certain standard way of doing things it tries to reduce creative writing down to a formula instead of acknowledging that many compelling and successful stories can have almost any imaginable form if perhaps many types of structures had been emphasized or structures had been pointed out as optional this would have been mitigated but the time period is so short that theres no time the result is a class that feels more like writing how to make a formulaic sellable book than anything with creative in the title	1
i liked the practice with python however some of the code was outdated and didnt work properly the course is abandoned no one reacts on the forum any morethe instructor occasional made mistakes or was repetitive sometimes i wondered if tucker was really knowledgeable about the domain that he tried to teach in this courseid only recommend this course if want to learn about capm sharpe ratio and event profiling	1
i love this course	4
the course should have been more thorough and should have been accompanies with good programming exercises as wellat some starting course there was also some cross talk among the instructors the module on image processing should be reviewed as after some point it becomes sort of boring	1
someone who doesnt pay doesnt really participate in this course	0
there is not enough instruction of using sas online	3
its ok i would love more practical examples	2
a good entry into database thinking homework is a tad on the high side for people who just want to learn on the side also not clear why diagrams cant be automated directly from the database programs eg access why would i draw an erd and then design a database separately  better just design the tables and the diagram directly then you have your erd from the program eg access or filemaker	3
tutarial was good for very begineer	3
useful information about nutrition i wouldve loved to learn more about that the part about homecooking and how to reduce the health risks when cutting an onion where too superficial and unnecessary for me	1
lots of theory but includes some useful models and formulas	2
in the beginning of the course i thought ill get a good experience as usual on coursera but i was wrong a lot of things  to be introduced in next courseconfusing data types  working with things i dont know about ityouve said that anyone with basics of programming could pass this course and after  months i couldntplease be sure about the prerequisites next time	0
a little too slow for my liking	2
very interesting easy to follow videos right level of detail on linear algebra and lots of algorithms techniques and tipsfor the last lessons however the practice is a bit black box where you have everthing initialized and you just plug in your functions id liked more details on how everything was set	3
great content	4
extremely useful tools and strategies for real everyday leadership	4
great course loved everything i learned	4
main issues i encountered in the course many videos end with a suggestion to refer to the suggested materials for more information which are these materials and where can they be found the slides could use some diagrams here and there as the constant text screens are monotonous and make understanding harder in some cases the course does not settle on a balance between breadth and depth of information some aspects are presented at a very high level yet using very specialised terminology and concepts for instance context switching when describing the disadvantages of microkernels or preemptively scheduled systems  i have a cs background and had no problem with these aspects but i am aware i am highly subjective its a case of chicken and egg where if you understand the low level concepts you probably dont need the course and if you dont understand them you also cant understand the high level concepts at the end of the week  videos describing the three oss it is said in order to know the details on how to write a program and run applications in riotcontikitinyos please come back to our lectures who have more detailed videoswhich lectures are these and where can they be found the only practical exercises in the course week  are only vaguely related to the courses targetsall this being said it is an ok introduction to the embedded os world if you bring your own cs and os background knowledge	1
great course well taught and very useful	4
a shame it is part of the cybersecurity specialization it is boring and full of obviouspsicology things like passwords need to be secure but easy to remember the instructor at least seems to have zero knowledge about software development everything we did in seven weeks could have been taught in one or two	0
condescending not backed up with evidence and preachy somewhere in there are some good ideas for making healthy food for kids but given im probably of similar politics to what theyre pushing and i found it obnoxious i think theyre alienating a lot of people must do better	1
 is a lot to pay for tutorials about how to install software this course takes only  minutes to complete it is also obsessed with command line interfaces theres a reason that they were left behind in the s it does cover gui software like rstudio which is ignored for the rest of the course how about something on the desktop github version httpsdesktopgithubcom so much easier to use	0
very useful and helpful courses good for anyone even without programming background	4
interesting course on the english legal system just keep in mind that the audio is not that great in some areas however i highly recommend this course	3
great content but not delivered in a very dynamic manner so hard to stay attentive	2
it was too easy and very basic not challenging enough but maybe i wasnt the right student for the class the lectures are too slow and repetitive too	1
low quality slides monotone lecturing style	1
a solid course for those who require a refresher on certain grammar rules but in my opinion the course should go deeper in the different parts of the english grammar for example what are gerunds or infinitives still a good course though i really enjoyed the teacher as well	2
beware if you are someone who is new to more advanced math or to any sort of coding this course will be very confusing totally unpractical and youll walk away not feeling like youve really learned how to use r in a real wayi was incredibly disappointed	0
the explanation of roles is clear so are other remarkt  piffalls  dos and donts but those are valid for all specialist functionscouple of remarks the target audience seems to be the data manager rather than any executive c c level of function hr dealing with building a data science team with regard to management and organizing i missed the academic level organisational design nor did it help in setting up data science where  how to start 	1
augmented reality technology is now being used in simulators as well no mention about this application was provided	3
much theorical with few examples could incorporate examples outside the health world as well	2
i love maya adam as a teacher	4
i really liked the videos with dan and norman great to hear from real people what we read on the books some times it feels unreal but when you see a real person telling you something is more credible	3
it is a poor propaganda for religious it even claims that creationism should be regarded as a viable alternative to evolution	0
great course it helped me to expland my knwoledge in query structure	4
should state up front that there is no auditing unable to continue this course without upgrading	0
great overview	4
it is a good brush up course but a lot of it was common sense	1
for me it was boring and too specific i had a great difficult in understanding iti quitted before ending	0
in getting feedback from my peer review which i am very open to feedback however i guess i did not appreciate being told what i should or shouldnt do in my classroom with my kids i appreciate suggestions for improvement but i felt that more critique was on my teaching style than my writing again i appreciate feedback but unless in my classroom with my kids and doing something i have done numerous times at the request of my own principal i did not thin it was fair also as a teacher there is never just one way of doing things there is always multiple ways and being told to do it one way there way was not appropriate at least for me so this course although very	0
not at all what i expeted	0
lacks of subtitles very disappointed	0
very good course with less emphasis in the videos and more on exercises and critical thinking the way i like and learn the best i particularly liked that the lecturer writes on a transparent vertical surface standing between him and the camera very convenient for those not so familiar with mathematics this might hurt a bit but the payoff is super positive	3
very well taught in such a manner that is so easy for understand even for people with nolaw background	3
it seemed to move way to quickly without a good explanation of how to use the script i learned a lot in html and css under this proff but not a lot from this course i continue to review it and look up other resources	1
somewhat basic and not very applicable	2
good course but outdated the sdgs were agreed upon in  and there are already ajor efforts ongoing to implement them the course only mentioned the draft sdgs which changed considerably later on therefore the course is useful for background information on sdgs but not to get uptodate with the sdg process	1
the class covered a good variety of subjects to learn there are some key areas of improvement you should build more examples in the lectures the lectures were short to start with but adding more examples and passages would have helped xylophone is perhaps the worst instrument to use to teach this course especially with the camera facing the front of the xylophone it was very hard to see what notes were being hit by the mallets especially when using chords and therefore it was very difficult to understand visually what gary was doing i suggest using a keyboard and having the camera shooting from the above of the keyboard look at how several people have done this on youtube this way you can see what notes are being hit held and you can see them from a pianists viewthe material was good but because of the two areas above the teaching was not as effective	1
the course is a bit too basic i expected to get deeper information about healthy eating than this course suggests thank you	2
it is a good course however i would have liked deeper knowledge in git	2
thanks for this course i never thought that java programming would be so easy and clear to understand	4
due to the course having been compiled from prof shillers regular lectures and short videos added later specifically for coursera the course in overall seems ragged and lacking an encompassing narrative chunks of lectures appear missing with things appearing on the blackboard between the video sequences and several previously we talked about x when x wasnt mentioned in the online course at alldisregarding that its still a useful and enlightening course	2
very practical concise lots of examples	4
i would have liked this course to be longer so that the information could have been spread out among more lectures rather than so much information condensed into one week it made the exams a little confusing	2
overall its good especially helpful for a novice like me however i did overcome some learning barriers in this class ppts are too theoretical eg there are quite a few ppts full of words and ppts like that would easily drive me distracted and sleepy hopefully itll be better 	3
too basic knowledge not enough information about targeted therapy everything is explained without going into any details	1
this course is not as well designed as the preceding courses in this certification the instructors lessons are poorly organized his activities offer little value and the quiz questions and answers are poorly written with regards to grammar and depth of knowledge the author also does a lot of selfpromotion with regards to his company his research studies and his bookthe only positive to this class is that it progresses quickly making the lack of quality more tolerable had this been the first course in this certification i would have dropped out and looked for a better program	1
i have learned a lot from this course	4
informative course for anyone not familiar with the ancient egyptians the quizzes have a low  threshold in order to pass but are not always easy	2
i feel that this course is not looked after teachers are not actively present there was an error on one quiz and another assignment was very poorly explained leading to many feeling like we lost marks due to not knowing exactly what was expected of us many of the lessons waste time gushing over whats coming next but quite often the lesson itself feels weak and vague at some points i struggled to understand the point the lessons were trying to make i learned a few interesting things but for the most part im extremely disappointed with this course	0
a thoroughly enjoyable and thoughtprovoking course thank you	4
the course was a bit disappointing we didnt cover enough advanced excel functionalities opting instead to focus on  statistical models binary classification and linear regression having a bsc in economics the linear regression tutorials and quizzes seemed infantile while the binary classification tutorials proved to be too vague when we actually had to apply this knowledge on the final project in retrospect i regret not starting to work on the final weeks material right from the start which resulted in having to switch session multiple times in order to finish the course even if i had done so though it wouldnt have made up for the vague instructions in the quizzes and assignment of the final week that made feel at a loss until i asked for help in the forums all in all this course need some serious reworking in terms of how the material is presented and how the assignments are phrased	1
a really hard class for anyone not graduated from collage	1
leve of difficulty was above my expectations moved too fast could have been more thorough in applying the content to examples similar to the quiz seemed to stick to the bare minimum of what would be required before moving to the quiz be transparent with future prospective students that this course absolutely requires knowledge of calculus probability and statistics	2
i actually did learn a lot from this course	4
it has been a great pleasure and satisfaction to have participated in this course	4
i was a little bit dissapointed with this course because in my opinion it is not structured well it is just an amount of questions we need to think about it has ended but i have the feeling i still have no good idea about what is world design for video games	1
apparently the instructor is wellinformed in the history of the bandnevertheless information is delivered in a huge portions sometimes cluttered and it s easy to lost in the narrativesound quality is bad the volume is jumping sometimes and there is a lot of noisemay i suggest that you provide a short arts of songs you are talking abouti understand there are copyright issues but still something should be done about itall in all i wish to enroll in the second improved release of this course	2
good its a worth your time	3
the professor is well spoken and the class started out very well but by the final section the hands on example were simply cutpaste with no explanation of what we were doing or how it worked its not the fault of the professor but this course and the big data specialization attempts to cover too much information graph analytics should be its own  course specialization but really to understand graph analytics one should be spending a great deal of time with the subject perhaps online courses are not the way to understand such a complex subject	2
very basic in terms of material covered would be nice as a free remedial class in prep for the main specialization homework assignments were confusing and did not appear to have been reviewed by the instructors before being sent to students main problem the free software students use was not the same version as that being used to develop the homework instructor support was not evident in the user forums below the quality of the free classes taken in the past	0
perfect course very good and talented teacher explains everything takes nothing for granted i would recommend to everyone who wants to learn front end web	4
this course relies heavily on selfreading and theoretical knowledge video interviews which are part of the curriculum are mostly not useful overall the course did not provide me with the value i was looking for	1
outdated and unsupported the code for the exercises was made for eclipse adt and google dropped support for eclipse a while ago the official ide for android development is android studio nowi could import the project for lab but im unable to compile the tests and the program with android studio i get a ton of errors my post in the forums about this is unanswered for  days now	0
machine learning is too simplified and spark part is not even explained also very little relation of all course with big data	1
easy to comprehend but far too basic to be helpful and i dont feel i received an understanding of financial statements because the course was too rudimentary	2
an excellent to understand basics of microeconomics	3
i absolutely loved this course it was enjoyable and i learned a lot more about music and art	4
a bit basic	1
i love this course it gave me confidence to restart my interest in photograph	4
i found the course informative but the quizzes to be a problem as there were too many multiple answers so was near impossible to complete the quizzes correctly	3
a daily demanding course which could have benefitted from more time spent in some areas  particular signals the video explaining a sample signal implementation was very rushed and provided too little detail on a lot of information that seems to be taken for granted	2
slow start to week  but the modern and the postmodern part  is a continuation to the modern and the postmodern part  so best to understand part  looking forward to week 	2
i loved the practical side of the course it opened up my mind on different possibilities and gave me the encouragement to explore and experience more	4
the topics from this course are very important and might be considered convoluted at times so it is nice to see that brian makes them actually easy to understand very comprehensive and has nice examples	3
the video materials were very poor they did not cover all the aspects and the explanations were very brief the course only contained a single project which although fun is not enough for learning a new language after completing this course i feel that i dont really know swift but i can use it after each week you have to complete a quiz they should replace these quizzes with project where you write real code i took this course for free but i wouldnt pay for it	1
great for those starting out getting their hands wet with a free copy of tableau	3
first week of  min video seriously we want to dive into the subject and the last two weeks should have more content felt like much more copy and paste without understanding why you did that understand this should be introduction to big data but the price you pay for the introduction is too expensive	1
very easy not worth the money it requests	1
no forum what are you thinking	0
it is not what i was expecting to learn from this course the course syllabus seems very good but the actual lectures are not good i would not recommend this course to any one i dont think we can call this as introduction of hrm because it doesnt give us any knowledge related with hrm the only new term to me is the highroad vs lowroad the rest is the common sense to me	0
i like the way that this courses brought to students	3
they have to put a note that this course is just for turkish students not for international 	0
im dropping out of a specialisation i paid for because the quality of the materials is really low and the presentation is very similar i dont want to discourage the presenters but this is not the level i expected	0
very insightful	3
very nice interface mobile friendly just for writing coding assignments i had to use laptop if app supported the same it would have been more convenient while course syllabus is direct and gives one idea of applying teaching for practical purpose which is good right and faculty is nice explains the concept in easy way	3
this was a good introductory course with some very informative video and instruction i only give it  stars because i felt it really lacked interactivity although quizzes were required throughout i felt too much of the class was simply sitting back and watching lectures	2
good introduction to the entire track	3
fundamentals of finance very useful for beginners of finance	4
classes were entertaining but sometimes a little messy	3
very bad course	0
this course is very good really enjoyed it helps develop the ability to think	4
much better than the data science with r concentration provided also by john hopkins this course has concrete examples and the lecturer doesnt treat his audience like the firstgrade kids i take this back the lecturer doesnt know what hes taking about and what he is gonna talk about for at least half of the time	0
super interesting particularly as got into the internet in during some of this era felt like time travel especially appreciated the interviews with the web security pioneers brings the topic to life thanks dr chuck	4
no teaching just a guy talking do the problem sets for practice if you need help pause the videos and try the code out yourselfseriously though a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it he doesnt work through code but talks around the concepts	0
unclear assignments lectures are brief and sometimes unclear spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning	0
as someone with little programming experience this course was extremely challenging and i dont think the information taught was enough to successfully complete the course i had to go to another online education source to teach myself r before i could do the coursera programming assignments	1
i like the content of the coursehowever there are some remarks i want to sharefor one of the asssignments i have to create an accout on soundcloud i never used it before and do not understand why i should leave somewhere my personal data if i do not plan to use this service in the future i assume it as direct manipulation and do not like it at all	2
i dont feel learning much after the class particularly i think the video should be better made to present the spreadsheet content more clearly and i think there should be more emphasis on important points during the lecture session	1
the course touches upon most important topics in data science but doesnt go deep into the topics covers most important important topics in data science on high level course works as a refresher to follow the course you should know the basics in statistics and modelling concepts like parsimonious model would be used with expectation that student already knows it	3
it was very well organised and presented there was good opportunity for repetition in the videos and good opportunity to study the main written expressions and grammar in the pdf files excellent	4
this course is very interesting have a basic aproach on accounting but develop the key drivers of financial accounting	4
the worst i dont recommend you to take any course from this institute it is just wasting time and money	0
not for beginners unless you are willing to invest a significant amount of time with outside sources beyond what is stated as needed to complete the course disappointing	0
very informative and examples from daily life is good too	4
he terribly prepared us for quizes and gave about  examples in the entire course i filled a notebook with about  pages of notes about  of which were useful for the quizes though content was good but i found myself looking things up because of his somewhat neive explanations of difficult concept	1
most of the course is providing useless statistics i didnt enjoy it and its a really basic course	1
i would like to thank you for this wonderful course i am a mechanical engineer i studied outside the us and this course with other courses are very useful and the way this course was presented is simple yet with so much information	4
a good introductory course which provides a general overview of the the us energy system the delivery is clear and succinctcould be expanded to cover the global energy system	3
hiim sorry to say that this course wasnt really useful i had the impression to see dozens of introduction videos about sustainables cities because in  weeks you have time to cover in details all the aspects of sustainable cities energy transport waste building sharing economy the condition is to focus each week to a topic it is too much based on powerpoint presentation and not at all on example concepts stay concepts we didnt visit one single town a connected building an innovative waste management system you quote  living labs lets go  pictures from the powerpoint are at least for half of them taken from pictures bank synthetic images not concrete desapointing always the same example malmo copenhagen what about the rest of the world  videos from wwh and iclei are clearly revolting is it some publicity for them  this is not the place for thatin contrast congratulations to yuliya voytenko for her speech about sharing economy it was clear precise focusedplease do your best to improve your courses you have the knowledge lets spread it	0
the name of this course is misleading to me and if its misunderstood by one you can assume there are other people affected as well  it would be more clear whats expecting you if the course would be called something similar to the last assignment name creating a datadriven websitethe responsive part that i was interested in was basically done with use bootstrap  thats pretty poor of course the course isnt responsible for this but an appropriate name would fix thatthroughout the course the quizzes were entertaining  but the quality of the questions is questionable sometimes the answer is obvious because the other answers are ridiculous sometimes you dont know what to click even though you just watched the video carefully reason for this is that there are questions being asked which werent even touched in the lessonits basically the same with the last assignment  you can watch and do all the lessons before youve got no idea how to start and what to do as theres simply no explanation of what affects what  which seems to be extremely important in javascript yes its often told in an overviewstyle explanation what a function is doing but something in depth that tells you how to write working javascript functions is lackingthe quality of the explanations also varied in their quality some things that were pretty easy to understand were explained over  very boring minutes other things that were far more complex and tricky were handled in half a minute this made watching the videos frustrating at times im not sure which kind of audience this course is supposed for but the style varies way too muchfurthermore its great that coursera is offering an ipadapp but id like to be able to use and do everything that the app is offering me and in the best case everything thats necessary for the course i cant even review classmates as theyre uploading rar or zipfiles which cant be accessed via ipad and also javascript is a problem for ipads unpacking such files and running them on your servers would be an option maybe	1
i think the intention behind including this course was probably well meaning i think it was a punishing course to get through for those of us who had no background in statistics scientific studies or programming while i was able to fail my way forward through it it was completely overwhelming and overly painful i really think the expectation should be set before students sign on to the specialization as was i wonder how many students gave up on the whole interaction specialization after this course prof wobbrock was great but i think there was a lot of vocabulary assumed to be known to us that just wasnt i felt like i had been dropped down on mars	0
this course it was great because i learn some tools to my career	4
the course is well structured and provides a good introduction however i expected a bit more from a course that costs  pounds than just a few clips on how to install and setup softwarecreate a github account etc this information is available for free online on the websites of the respective softwarei understand that such an introduction is needed for the course but then do not offer it as a separate  pound module instead include it for free with any other specialization you can buy	1
inspiring easy to absorb	2
ill say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization if you have the skills to complete this course then you dont need to take this course if you dont have the skills to complete this course you will not complete this course the course instruction is at  feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will not teach you the skills required to complete the assignments the aws final assignment is a very much throw you into the deep end with no real instruction well at least completely outdated instructions and will expect you to swim or more likely for most people to drowni recommend the machine learning course from bills colleagues at university of washington that is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments though still very challenging	0
i signed up for this course hoping for a good introduction to oo programming and java only to not be able to verify if i have even learned anything of course i can access the course material but the fact that cannot even manually check if my answers are correct with certainty makes all of this less efficient than simply learning it by myself	0
first i would like to say that with the exception of one exam i was able to take all the tests without watching the videos that shows that this is a poorly put together course secondly this course did not cover child nutrition it covered general nutrition there was nothing helpful in regards to meal planning with children although there was useful information in the lunch packing video although it claims the project at the end of the course is optional it will not let me complete the course without doing the project i find that extremely frustrating this course offered a lot of great information even if it was a weird combo of factualopinionated i was frustrated by the fact that this course is obviously geared towards the upper middle classrich instead of the the everyday bluecollar family i will do the project to complete the course but was very disappointed in my first course through coursera	1
good coverage of bootstrap but the other parts were very briefly touched upon nodejs bower etc	2
i liked the content of this course and for the most part i thought it was pretty decent i just felt that the lectures needed a bit more structure since there didnt seem to be a very good transition between topics the some of the quiz questions in this course were broken since they were missing details that we crucial to answering the questions missing weights or having wrong answers since the posted values didnt align with the answer	2
sorry to say that but this course has nothing related to programming i like drchuck courses especially  in this specialization but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots if you have any programming experience you dont need this course it doesnt pay off your time you spend for this sorry again but its my opinion	1
i expect the projects and peer graded to be a litle difficult	1
mostly just common sense and the peer review assignments are mindnumbing	1
i was slightly disappointed by the course too much information was given and not always in a clear way in particular sometimes the sessions were jumping from one discipline to another with not much explanation and this was confusing also the information provided was in huge amounts but not in details i expected to get more detailed information on childrens rights while sometimes the presentations were only very general overviews	2
time for an update	1
the first two assignments certainly tested knowledge of the subject however the last two assignmnets were lacking good course that does what it is supposed to do more feedback from test cases would be very helpful	2
the course capstone was very disappointing it has nothing to do with business and financial modeling it is nothing more than a very questionable portfolio construction exercise on optimized weights and parameters not only such a portfolio is pretty unrealistic but it has nothing to do with business modeling	0
kind of helpful to illustrate the essentials of the global capital markets including equity debts foreign exchange and forward future contracts etc hope you may enjoy	3
the course does not allow students to take part in quizzes before paying for itbut the quality of the course material is amazingly high and easy to follow	0
great course it goes through the simple to the complex stuff about how your brain works when you are learning it also teaches how to tackle procrastination and get rid of the anxiety during a testnot to say about the awesome teachers that we got learn how to learn	4
course was amazing it deals with how to correctly understand visual illusions through empirical data collection it does not delve into the anatomical aspects or the cellular aspects of vision some drawbacks would be the lack of explanation on how to model or collect the data which is probably too complicated to state in a online course anyway	3
last exercise is half the course and took many frustrating hours to install and for me never worked no support provided by instructors you are on your own	0
most of the homework assignments arent graded correctly out of the box and have errors also only specific solutions are selected otherwise its great material at a good pace	2
great course	3
this should not be a course in itself	0
good attempt	3
hard to follow for nonnative speakers especially week  there are a lot better courses on entrepreneurship on coursera especially the technion ones	1
an evaluation is always tied to the value it provides in relation to the paid priceon the plus side it provides an interesting historical perspective of search engines their evolution and the evolution of the algorithms and their purposes rebeka may talks slowly and clearly the transcripts also help in reviewing the contents of each lessonon the minus side it is very theoretical and with no practical application lots of terminology pops out of the blue without any prior explanation and would be difficult to understand for a total newbie just as a very simple example backlinks are mentioned several times what is a  backlink  i know what they are but not everybody does there should be real support material not merely  transcripts the peer review does not make any sense there should be a real test the peers do not have a higher knowledge level to make an evaluation of the alummni it is not possible to take the quizzes unless you  upgrade  presently this costs  conclusion it is an interesting course but at   provides no valueaudit the course instead uc davies and coursera should provide this course free of charge or with a voluntary donation	1
pretty good learn with c primer helps a lot	4
this was a fine overview however i was hoping to drill down into more detail on some of the roles and responsibilites data teams can have for example data architects stewards etc	2
good course stands well in the specialization it was a bit buggy throughout tho and the assignments could have focussed more on the control part	2
very interesting	3
youll need to pay to take the quizzes which is a bummer but over all a very interesting well done and thought provoking look into morality and how we define what is moral	3
the course seems to be a course in scrummerfall ie a mixture of scrum and waterfall after having briefly discussed the agile manifesto which emphasizes things like people over processes what is the first thing that they dive into processes where they say things like requirements combined with processes are the backbone of any successful software project i would disagree requirements and processes are important but people and communications are the backbone of any successful software projectim dropping this specialization and searching for another course that really follows agile methodologies	1
the video lectures were good the tests were almost a give away and the essays were an opportunity to practice what i learned from the lectures my only biggest disappointment is that the essays were evaluated by students like me i received evaluations that doesnt tell me much or evaluations that doesnt make sense if i only knew that this course was not an instructor supervised course i would have been willing to pay extra money just to get a professional to assess my essay and provide me with feedback at this point i am disappointed that i decided to just watch the videos but skip the peerreviewed essays and make the most of what i paid for	1
awesome experience	3
i like mr balch but to be honest i learned next to nothing maybe this is a good course for somebody who has no background in finance as for myself i felt that i was wasting time and money the book associated with this course was just like the course itself shallow and doesnt go in any depth to explain the matter fully and rigorously if you want to know what computational investing is you can take this class googling a bit will have roughly the same effect though if you want to learn how to actually do computational investing do not take this course  its just not serious enoughas the name of this course implies you probably expected to find part ii somewhere which was promised to be a course about using machine learning in investing  or  years after part i went live part ii is still missing and probably will never come outthe software used in this course qstk is buggy and has been so for  years its not maintained by anyone and the people taking this course had to find ways to overcome qstk bugs to be able to complete their assignmentsand lastly the exercises there are none all you get is a lame quiz for every week which basically asks to change some variables in the scripts provided i did some coding for week  but that was it no coding practice after that	1
certainly for selfteachers disciplined people who want to go the extra step really nice contextualizing not too difficult in terms of time or content but certainly stimulating forms a nice basis for continuous improvement and self reflection for those of use who were not trained to do so in a more formal setting	3
it was nice course  i learnt so many things not only technical but other things about myself also	4
not very motivating lectures too much talk but lacks the essential clarity	2
if people can mitigation a climate change the world will be solve the problems  i hope this course can make me clear about climate change in the world  whys climate change  whats the problems 	3
you didnt give me an honor code certificate	3
when they say basic they mean baaaassssiiiic good course to start with if youre not used to web development if you have developed web pages and web applications this course will be a breeze	3
good introduction qstk not an optimal tool and many of the things were a tad too general technical analysis as a whole is a bit sketchy subject but this course gives a good intro to it	2
i am thinking that the teacher can be a little bit dynamic and energetic	2
the course contents are unfortunately very poorly designed and this has been an ongoing trend in this overall specializationthe weekly lecture videos are at times quite unclear and leave more questions unanswered than they answer i and other learners have found glaring gaps in the course content again and again the examples that the lecture videos use do not nearly cover the variety of datasets being used by the learners in the course and the least that could have been done is to at least inform learners of what to expect if they were dealing with a different research question and using an alternate dataseti know the defense may be that the videos are meant to be introductory  gateway to a deeper understanding of that particular topic the course moderators  instructors did a terrible job in keeping up with answering key questions that were posted in the discussion board yet most of the times when i was still searching for answers looking up similar introductory videos in youtube were far more helpful and i didnt have to pay to watch themthe assignments are poorly worded because the instructions are not always very clear which in my opinion set up a lot of learners including myself for failure the lectures are often broader than what should be considered when finishing the weekly assignment it wasnt even clear at times of what was exactly being expected in the assignment the rubric that i had to use to mark my peers work meant their analysis had gaps because the criteria for assessment is not transparent at all during the submission of an assignment they are starkly different in terms of detailsall to say that i have been quite frustrated despite my best efforts to learn from these materials and much much more can be done to improve the actual content of the lecturesplease consider adding alternate resources as well where learners can go seek the right answers if the answer is not provided by the lecture materials this can help to cut back on countless precious hours for those who are juggling a fulltime job and retraining  career change like i am not to mention the countless other scenarios of other learners out therei am neither inattentive nor lazy and learning this content is very important to me if it wasnt clear through my comments here alreadyone last comment for those of you who are all very sceptical let me tell you that i know that i dont have to be a statistician to grade the course contents and i really hope the intructors are paying attention to these and similar comments from those enrolled in this specialization and the others who have completed the course	0
excellent introduce in machine learning with stunning teacher	4
this is a very good course i liked it very much	4
the course info was too simple while the explanation of why galaxy and what the idea behind it was great the content taught by the videos was more than basic all this i have learned by trial and error myself and i completely missed the info of why using this tool and not others about extra options we did not talk at alladditionally after all these easy lectures and quizzes we were left with the final assignment that was superhard the vidoes only prepared for  of the workflow asked for and for the rest one was left alone with a tool that was suboptimally introduced furthermore the galaxy instance was crashing regularly making the convenient batch tool impossible to usewhile i liked the idea of grading each other it was too much work as everybody got different answers because of too hard questions therefore i spent quite some time on grading which i did not expect	1
waste of time except for git and github nothing much is in it	0
course is very informative and practical	3
good structure but a basic courseits a good compilation of information about ios and androidi think that some generic informations should be also consider on this course no matter if its ios or androidsome videos explaining the features like gps siri multicore processor would be good	2
this course is very difficult to follow not because the topics are hard or too technical but mostly due to lecturers poor job in explaining and creating a narrative	0
very general ideas about diplomacy but nothing concrete	0
i am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding but there wasnt any in any case thanks dr chuck 	2
great course to start learning meteor js	3
i adore both this and part one of the course a	4
opened up everything for me never wrote before and now i write many times a day	4
very well done  stars so i know i have completed the lectures but not the work will change after completing assignments	2
the content for teaching how to create website is nothing the name should change to how to create a website with wordpress i found some videos on the internet help more than this course however some links and information are very useful	2
rd assignment is tooooo easy  i expect here complicated task with nontrivial work with modules but not this childs playsother assignments and lectures looks good but here is too many errors in subtitles  not critical but in every video i detect at least 	3
good intro coursefor cloudera vm installation to practice hadoop session be ready with at least an i pc with gb ram	3
no practical at least till the end of this course in this specialization	2
gives a really broad overview of ml concepts examples and assignments use a commercial dato product called graphlab create expect nothing else	2
thoughtfully designed course	4
great	4
its a damn awesome coursethe main thing about this course is i didnt lose intrest in course till lastas most of the times i start the course but never complete it before	3
extremely superficial the total content in this course would make a nice introduction segment to a full course	1
the teachers there do not do what they teach they rattle down their text as fast as they can speak and do not emphasize the content with movement or even change of expression i was disappointed	0
mainly work with applets	3
too simplistic if you already have some knowledge about a healthy lifestyle	1
the quiz is so frustrating	1
was not as good as previous courses in this specialisation	0
great course it provides you a lot of useful information and tools towards to take actions in saving the world of ourselves	4
sways between incorrect definitions and buzz words to word dense academic papers lacks clarity to the point of bringing the providers expertise in to question only those who understand a concept and have relevant experience have a hope of explaining it  calls in to question the motive of the course and coursera  this seems more like marketing or presales than it does education	0
poor very boring and dull presentation hardly anything is explained very clearly it would be far more profitable to simply study an appropriate textbook or online course notes	0
the course is quite interesting and fun i enjoy the moment i got the correct output 	4
a very good coursei was looking it sinc a long timethank you coursera	3
good one	3
very nice coursethank you	4
the lectures were very informative and clear i had no problem giving the quizzes with the lectures the project i had no clue where to begin there has to be extra lectures included to guide the project i hope they add some lectures as whatever lectures are currently available are	1
interesting review of historical voting mechanisms and their flaws easy to finish in one settingnot to offend the course instructor but uhm how can i say uhm every sentence starts stops and uhm is interjected with filler words uh um etc extremely annoying at x speed	2
problem with quiz week 	1
first of all i really enjoyed professor ittners presentations sadly his presentation was only  of the course professor ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content i had a good feeling that i could really understand the material he was teaching if i could give a rating for just professor ittner i would give a  star rating now this is why i am giving this course a  star rating but i do have to say going into the depths of accounting analytics is not easy you really need to have a good grasp of accounting otherwise you will get lost professor bushee did not make the first  weeks really easy to get through while i enjoyed his examples  case studies he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching and worst of all he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions make pointless statements or answer with pointless statementsanswers i really wish i had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this i would estimate that its around  but it could very well be higher there are so many different examples to pick form but ill just pick a few here i didnt read the iliad or odyssey some im not going to ask you to in reference why in regression there are greek letter used for coefficients its a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients a  second exchange where a pc generate student says that theyre stocked to run some regression followed by proffessor bushee informing us that were going to run some narly regressions professor bushee saying he doesnt know how to perform earning management analysis on mars but he certainly knows how to do it on earth and a joke why people dont like accountants these segments add absolutely zero value they lengthen the time of the course to make maters worse im sure proffessor bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together	0
very disappointed in this course it is more of an infomercial for american gut than an actual course additional knowledge gained was very little	1
the lecturer does not clearly explain the topics very well especially on the topics in probability and distribution his presentation in english is honestly quite hard to understand	1
i didnt think it was possible to dislike finance more after taking a course designed for nonfinancial professionals clearly i should have known more about finances before taking this class and perhaps i would have liked it more however i left the course feeling more frustrated than ever	0
quite basic  but good overview of general theory dont do this on its own its quite useless as a standalone module	2
very helpful and interesting	4
basic web course and very well detailed i could review basic concepts of html css and javascript to continue in the specialisation series	3
very general information with too much dependance on the textbook for the course you might as well just read the book	1
i have great learning on this even though i has some experiences on building marketing prediction model it has refreshed my memory and also i have learned new thing in this course too thanks prof for conducting this course	3
primarily focused on us politics and the us policy system discusses mostly the problems with the us system of governance and it therefore not really useful for international viewers	1
awesome programming exercises	4
its ok html is not code its a markup language when she cant explain sheo covers it up with attitude words or skips quickly	0
course work was entirely optional and only started at the end of week  the required level of involvement was too low to be helpful i dont learn well just watching lectures  i can get that much from youtube however i expect a bit more when paying  for a specialisationthe first module in the series was too basic but at least there was a lot of coding involved this second module didnt even have that	0
not practical for beginners probably useful if you already have extensive experience with other programming languages	2
instructor seems uninterested or bored sometimes he only reads the slides without adding anything else to the content others he goes quickly through a slide without any time to digest the information overall intro level concepts are ok but specifics about creation or handling of tools is left without deeper explanation	0
i enjoyed a lot of this course especially the parts about evolution and social intelligence very interesting however as a professional dog trainer and having studied through the karen pryor academy i was very disappointed to see brian hares misunderstanding of clicker training i would be happy to chat with him about the realities of clicker training and how an event marker works if hed be interested futhermore i bought the book and paid for a certificate but because i took over  days to complete the course despite the course being selfpaced with suggested deadlines to help you keep on track i did not get my certificate and was informed that to get it id have to pay again for the same product	2
i gained much from this course however the final assignment is quite difficult to complete for students with no access to data on companies and industries had that been readily available without an exorbitant fee to data providers i would have rated the course with  stars	2
awesome introductory course on algorithm	4
great course and a great instructor	3
strong accent	1
very little depth i dont recommend this if you dont already have background in statistics or r i really didnt learn anything i mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects	0
poor very poor course worse course structure instructor hasnt put any thoughts in how they should strucutre this coursecover no basics assumes lots of thing and term this course as beginner for java where actually there is no java taught	0
the accentpresentation  stuttering is too cloudy  not suitable for foreigners	1
not as clear as the previous courses	2
even do the research subject was very interesting this capstone was a total disappointmentthe capstone did not offer very much support and the final review was performed for peers without previous knowledge and experience receiving peers complaints due to the fact that many got bad gradingalso many peers complaint about the image of the specialization certificate for not being designed professionally and many felt that they petitions where overlook	2
coursera and this course sucks you are at the mercy of idiots doing your peer review	0
very helpful fundamental get cleared easily with world class pundit andrew and a guide like tom mosher  there are reason why this course is highly sought a small problem i face is that r programming is used industry wide prefer more than octave hence finding it difficult to participate in any race nevertheless with fundamentals from this course r is just another language moreover there are prebuilt packages and platform for machine available in the net what one needs is strong fundamentals	4
i understand that this is a project centered course however i do not feel like i walked away with a solid foundation of what goes into creating synthesizer sounds sure i learned that i can change parameters within a synthesis program and thereby get various sounds but thats about all i was expecting to gain fundamental understanding of the various parameters and what they really do and a more solid understanding of the process of creating custom patches rather then following an example and subsequently making minor adjustments so that it fits my style	1
disappointed with lecturesstructured data rather than real life examplesprofessor is speaking monotonously without passionno visualisation on the discussed topic	0
all lectures are presented very professionally and in form which is easy to understand steady progress easy to learn unfortunately practical part doesnt allow too much flexibility to play with the code to do extra work add some features be just little more creative i understand that it was graded by program and needs to have some limits but this can be solved by given hard criteria that needs to be met and peer assessment grading which will wider students horizon by checking others code to see others ideas this missing spark for creativity make me to give only  starts in whole it is great course worth any minute spendthank you vlad	3
the provided material is good but not good enough to be called a course it seems more like a talk not a course i suggest to add more materials or merge with other courses	0
great refreshment or intermediaryintro course too much focus on the us system at first and perhaps a disproportionate focus on schools of thought but extremely useful pragmatic and learner friendly	3
good and relatively easy course perfect to establish personal confidence	3
good if you want to fall asleep the content is probably interesting but they would have some use of advice from the entertaining industry	0
the material was very interesting but the lecturers were often very difficult to understand	1
after almost a year i am still waiting to receive my grade of  for c	0
he is awesome in reaching every aspect of classical music	2
this course took a lot of work to create i would have like more quizzes during the lectures and the assignments to have walk through the steps more the best course i have seen online is the machine learning course by andrew ng httpswwwcourseraorglearnmachinelearninghomewelcomei did really enjoy the course thank you	2
interesting	3
the course lacks coherence which comes as a big disappointment as it follows two excellent modules by greg northcraft	2
walks you step by step getting you setup and familiar with the core software	3
short lectures long intro ridiculous music very quickly decided to learn this elsewhere	0
a good course but not up to par with the first two the content was far more theoretical and left me looking for applicable information that said it was still a good course	2
great course for any student interested in how the internet come to be and the peopletechnology behind it	4
boring lecturer monotone passionless reading of even more boring powerpoint slides and images and absolutely no intelligent discussion going on in this course i have learned more from reading the book the epigenetics revolution  by nessa carey a book written for laypersons than i have from this course taught by university professors dont waste your time	0
this is a great course if you have literally no idea what the internet of things is and if you find using a smartphone challenging	1
some concepts are a little difficult for a non finance person however so far it seems very interesting and useful	3
thanks	4
good however the instructor videos could be better in content	3
i found the course pretty engaging i enjoy studying it and also feel encouraged to do some further study however the topics that are taught are not very holistic to me compared to some other basic psychology courses anyway its still a nice course to take 	3
 this course is a blueprint for budding doctors in their quest for their elixir of lifethe best  for me seminal part of the course was distinction between different field of informatics with examples hitherto everyone seems to be confused with public health informatics population health informatics population health management this course has glued the different pieces into a perfectly fitting jigsaw puzzlethe best informatics related course i have seen encompassing the whole breadth of healthcare transformation through health it	4
very helpful thank professor andrew	4
basically not much content the guest speaker uses unnecessarily weird examples in his talk	1
very poorly organised material and illustration	0
this course is not suitable for beginners at all everything basic is skipped highly not recommended	0
very interesting and helpful	4
very impressed with the course  though i must admit it is not for the weak hearted requires good knowledge matrix manipulation	4
pretty good i think	2
the entire course lacks a flow it looks like concepts that are taught are picked at random and stuffed into the course the quizzes really do not complement the material taught the instructor wants the students to focus on specific wordings of his lecture rather than the concepts in order to pass the quizzes	0
i learned a lot in this course about all the ways one can find info online about your productbusiness some of the guest lecture videos didnt hold my attention all that well but im glad we had their perspective	3
interesting although course content and test questions were very easy	2
the class needs to be more accessible especially for non statisticians i learned more from khan academy which got me through this class than the class itself	1
this capstone is unavailable most part of the year i paid in advance for the complete digital marketing specialisation which is a  year subscription thinking i can complete the course anytime i want that is how they advertise it i finished all the theory well within the  months into my enrolment when i came to the capstone project it was unavailable and for almost  months when i contacted courseraorg they had no clue when it is going to start i am a working professional and my schedule gets very busy when i am on projects and ever since then whenever the capstone is available my schedule has been very busy i have completed  assignments in capstone and  to go and the  year subscription is over courseraorg says i have to pay for it again to continue which i am never willing to there is no courtesy to a studentcustomer who has paid for the course i have paid in full but i dont have the digital marketing specialisation certificate this platform is more about money than education	0
the materials provided are awesome but the peer graded system does not work properly given that not everybody commits to giving feedback	3
a little bit easy i guess this course is for the beginners	2
i never knew excel had so much possibilities	4
good one dave	4
really good course on htmlcssjavascript enough resources and practices exercises	3
this course will be a good revision if you have known the models before taking it but if you are new to the models you may not really understand them this course tells you which models to use and how to implement but does not tell you the rationale behind maybe the theories are too difficultthe teaching staff are really helpful and answer every question you raise in the discussion forum	2
im slowly coming to the conclusion that this is a poorly made course for building a thorough understanding of how these different neural networks actually function and building a lower level understanding the lecturer often introduces concepts that are specific to these types of neural networks without explaining what they are for example when discussing convolutional nets he casually starts talking about an embedding layer and a mapping layer without really explaining what it is i found this video on youtube httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuaeyuemtm and realized that this gives me a significantly more concrete understanding of how convolutional neural networks actually function than these lectures	0
i think the coming classes will be great more than that  but its good	1
nothing interesting common information about nothing sorry	0
this course is a very basic introduction but i think it is an importa	3
i think this course is missing some key elements for a complete beginner i would suggest to expand on bootstrap and how to work with it for example what do i do with the bootstarp files i have downloaded where do they go how to find their classes etc	2
instructor is very goodhis explanation about contiki is simple supercourse structure is very goodbutin my opinion require little bit elaborated explanation about assignmentrather than everything is finethanks to coursera	3
this course definitely requires prerequisite knowledge of calculus and matrix math there is also very little in the way of practical application the matlab work is interesting but barely explained the assignments were nearly impossible without help from other students understanding which equations that were shown in the lecture not necessarily explained were useful in completing the assignments was not apparent and there was no help from the tasi dont think the assignments were irrelevant but without having a background in academic engineering the course needs to walk through similar exercises with explanations to increase understanding and ability to complete the coursewhile i dont think this course was well presented and i cant say i truly learned anything i am glad i was exposed to the material and i will continue with the specialization	1
not as good as the other courses i do wish another instructor could have done the videos i had a very hard time staying with this course due to my frustration with instructor style of communicating i felt like to much basic info about marketing especially traditional vs digital advertising most of us get that i dont know when ive struggled so hard to keep my attention and focus on the material this specialization starts with a bang and ends very boring and outdated feeling	1
it is a good course for beginners in python language	2
good course	4
i am an engineer and i use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking machine learning course by stanford which is fabulous i did not like this course for the following reasons bad course design structure so confusing and inappropriate sequence super fast without providing any intuition no fundamental explanation course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject	0
cool cool cool	4
unfortunately there is no involvement academic staff so there is no assistancesupport the course is put out there and students are left to their own devices the calibre of students is poor and informed discussions nonexistent a great pity because the content on occasion is interesting	1
this course is very nice just needs more details in the lectures to explain some difficult points in a simple way and the homeworks could be much comprehensive to help students understand the rational of each theory although this could require adding more weeks but up to  weeks is worth doing as this course is essentially taken by students with research goals like me i hope we can see some improvements in this course year	3
sorry to say that but this course has nothing related to programming i like drchuck courses especially  in this specialization but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots if you have any programming experience you dont need this course it doesnt pay off your time you spend for this sorry again but its my opinion	1
good for general knowledge about healthy di	2
i think the lecture is pretty basic and general compared with the other lectures in the marketing mix implementation course many examples were suggested but i think it would be better if there were more international brands rather than spanish brands there were many errors in subtitles i would appreciate if they were double checked before release	1
i liked it but i felt like they didnt get very in depth about a lot of the topics it was hard to take notes because there seemed to be a lot of skimming of subjects and jumping around	2
need to change the instructor and the way the course is being taught	0
an awesome course the teacher is good and the calendar is well organizedhowever as to me there are some points that have not been explained clearly and the some quizzes are just terriblehope to see the improvements	3
there must be something wrong to spend time on googlewiki much more than the course content	2
loved the professor do not like essay questions	2
concise would give it  starts if there were more simulations	3
very interesting to progess beyond a pure technical approachthen some modules are really to much verbose and may be much more effective with more examples	3
i love this course when i am starting to struggle in a class and cannot figure out what i am doing wrong i always come back to this course to review barbara oakley you are an amazing person and you encouraged me to give collage another try despite my learning disabilitiesthank you and thank you to everyone else who make this course possibletroy	4
classic style of teaching	4
interesting but very superficial i would say	2
very good course though a bit less challenging than i have expected a true capping of the previous courses	3
expecting more content like the actuall experience of creating wireframe step by step and finally complete wireframe	3
i hope mrs margaret tutorial will help me in managing my work future	3
very repetitive content provide only some abstract presentation of the technics used	1
good course for a free one thank you for all of your great work somehow the pace is too fast covering about  sections per week is by far too hard to read the book along with the class theres no practice exercise to strengthen what you learn the assignment is very hard and sometime dont directly implement the knowledge you learn in that week sometime the video sound is too quiet but you can read the transcript when it happened the book is better in my opinion	2
very good teachers simple but useful facts quizzes fun and easy	3
nice course covering basic doctrine of eu law i recommend it	3
excellent course for anyone who wants a clearer understanding of negotiations  great examples used lecturer is easily understood and the topics covered are very interesting	4
it is a important to all developing contries that the current facing froblems in all countries of the globalisation and population grouth	4
good introduction to embedded systems and operating systems discuss interesting topics and the architecture of os a little hard and challenging but it worth it	3
good introduction of what is to come but nothing too provocative or thought provoking	1
excellent course and professor goes with a steady pace	3
i find this to be very very basic advice on how to write a scientific paper i cant even see where the project is coming plus the strong accent of instructors makes it really hard to follow sometimes  even with the subtitles to make things even better accessing the quizzes is imposible unless you pay for the certificate i found the course disappointing	1
this course is not maintained its flat out exploitative to throw students at an aws assignment without updated instructions and with outdated versions of pig scripts etc theyre setting students up to hemorrhage money on aws and possibly not get anything out of it under no circumstances should you take this course or even this specialization so long as this assignment is gating it	0
nice coursehowever it will better to have the slides it is hard to review a specific concept with videos	3
this is a great course giving all the requirements to get started in machine learning	4
this was a great course and gave me a very good starting point for html css and js the only negative i found was that the js module seemed a bit rushed and the assignments at the end of last two modules didnt really test my understanding of js concepts very well they were too simple because the starter code had a lot of things already written out making them more barebones and having the student fill out most of the details would be a more handson and useful activity in my opinion	3
great course  thank you kevin hartman	4
i would have given this course no stars at all if that option were availablethe course is designed in contradiction of all the principles it preachesthere are no forums for the students there is no way you could contact the instructor the instructor keeps reading badly stammering like a firstgrader speaks monotonously and theres no interaction whatsoeverfurthermore there are mistakes in the quizzes and you have to choose blatantly wrong options if you want to get the  scorealthough the subject matter about virtual instruction is pretty interesting and the instructor made it sound like the most boring thing in the worldmany of the links are outdated or not working at all and often the documents she refers to are  or more years old bear in mind that virtual instruction is a fast developing field and the technology as well as the legal framework are changing very fast tooin a nutshell if this course were not a part of a specialization track i would not have paid for itunless you want to do the specialization i wouldnt recommend this course or any by the uc irvine because all of the lack forums and no channels for communication with the instructorsin one word bad	0
bad lecturers and instructions	0
nice introductional course to r i was only missing some illustrations that would enhance the understanding of the matter	3
i didnt understand very much of this course instructor relies heavily on the use of various charts they were seldom explained in a way i could understand instructor seemed to believe that underlining things in the charts served as an explanation after completing the entire course  listening to many of the lessons several times i cant tell you what we like to hear and why instructor speaks in a monotone with no emotion seems bored stiff seems like hes just talking but his mind is elsewhere quizzes frequently contained questions for material to be covered in a future lesson	0
i expected much more detailed and deeper knowledge from the course	1
the professor was completely inadequate many parts were unsuitable for this course he has eliminated the useful discussions among students without explanation	0
lack of examples sometimes it is not easy to understand what lesson is about	1
the professor did not interact with people i was wiling to see some discussions and contributions among people	0
good course ideal for the first half of a second course in computer science a little java experience is recommended buy youll probably be ok if you have program in a statically type programming language before because you can pick up java very quickly the lectures are very good i think that the teachers are excellent expositors but i feel that they could be more detailed the project is about representing earthquakes in a map and you are always increasing the complexity finally you need to add your own extension which i found an excellent opportunity to test your imagination and your capacity to create new thingsthe only cons of the course for me is the way assignments are evaluated i think it has to do with the fact that they are interactive you have to answers questions in a quiz related to the week content and the project but the are not very demanding therefore they do not reflect how much you really knowin general i recommend taking this course if you are in self study journey in computer science even more the specialization start to get more interesting and demanding in the follow up courses more complete and detailed	3
too much material that moved too fast wasnt opportunity for enough feedback and explanation i say this as someone who went to duke and has taken similar classes at duke	1
definitely a good course	4
perfect course most informative and interesting i did learn how to learn	4
i was attracted to this course because it offered the science behind buddhism and i am studying neuroscience i have abandoned it as it is yet an other exposition of buddhism neglible science neglible evidence  just stuff i already knew from nonscientific buddhist sources	1
i learned a lot still i wish the explanation were more geared toward beginners	2
bad course things mentioned by the instructors are naive according to my knowledge my knowledge about chinese philosophy come from a history of chinese philosophy youlan feng history of chinese philosophy szekwang lao that is not chinese philosophy at all	0
too mechanistic not much creative modules	0
the two or three minute videos were annoying i understand that this is what video marketing is about and ps not too many people truly watch the videos lessons should be  minutes each	0
sadly this course is not an introduction to swift programming as a beginner i found this course was not structured and i was confused about the correct steps to take in order to start programming in swift no doubt that these guys are knowledgable but they do not plan the course or teach in a linear fashion furthermore the sound and video quality is poor and i have decided to quit this course after the first week and a half	0
great course	4
it shows you some great functions in octave but im confused about all the θ₁ and θ₂ stuff	1
very good course	4
this is a game changer it blew me away to see how just a couple of hours a week for a month could change my approach to learning and teaching too so radically and improve it so much i am deeply indebted to mrs oakley and mr sejnowski for providing such important knowledge in such an easy going way	4
the ideas and concepts explained here are really important but are explainedwritten in a bit messy manner	2
i dont know why but its so frustrating that i have problem with this course i cant start every quiz in week 	0
hi the course is a nice introduction to the wind energythe exercises are well balanced and sometimes challengingi would to suggest a final exam where you have to use all the knowledge learnt along the  weeks and perform a preproject of wind turbine and install it in wind farm this way by doing your own design the concepts are seens as a whole	3
thats terrible i cant see any english subtitles added to this course besides tests are not relevant to the content taught in the video	0
there just wasnt much to this class its not bad information but it could have been done in one week	1
he teaches even worse then me this course has no practical example its just introductionfrom start to endwhen i enrolled in this course i was expecting that at the end of this course i will be able to develop an app or anything like that but know i think that i have just wasted my time	0
i had forgotten how much reading there is i didnt have a lot of time but i enjoyed the lectures a lot and it revisited my interest in history and ancient civilizations i think i learned more from this than the ancient civ class i took many years ago in college most enjoyable	3
really too basic for meaningful learning the instructor was not very engaging and by the end of the course just seemed hungry and ready to be done	1
the course starts with a short introduction on the topic of usability and user experience a good idea but not very well presentednext is an intro to bootstrap ok but not deep enough for a course called responsive web designthe last two weeks cover javascript or more precisely they cover a few javascript librariesto sum it up the course could really use a revision there are too many mistakes in the examples and sometimes the instructors look a bit unprepared and confused	0
actually i know a bit python and it seems that the course was not that meangingful to me but the teacher and assignment are really nice	2
as a person who actually studied physics and knows a little about data science i am literally baffled the way information presented and lectures speak really dont recommend this cource at all because week  materals is a imcomprehenisble mess full of incorrect explanation and vague definitions	0
this course was not nearly as valuable to me as the first course in the series it breezed through a bunch of different plot types without explaining in enough detail what they would be used for or when you should choose to use them at the same time it also didnt provide enough clear examples of how to do basic things in matplotlib which seems to me to be a very nonintuitive thing with poor documentation i found the first assignment to be very difficult	1
even if it is a really simple course i found it interesting and fun even the homework were really funny to do much better than the second onei just say that pricing is too high for a course that actually put  basic concept for each video	3
this course would be great if you are experienced in python or any other programming language the title  beginner specialization no prior experience required is very misleading and if you do not have any experience you will struggle a lot especially to complete week    assignmentsit makes you think and requires a lot of selfstudy which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills however assignments are way too challenging for those who are beginners or have little realworld experience i would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming experiencehaving said that teaching team is great  very knowledgeable and supportive	2
all the lecture were thorough and good	3
the assignments were not well supported by the lecture material which were much to shallow i guess an intro level course is going to be broad and shallow but if you are going to have assignments that require implementation then that should be better supported by the material and dont even get me started on the final	1
it is an interesting course as a first contact with epidemiology and public health	2
a much awaited end for a very compelling specialization nevertheless the work felt a little bit lonely since there was not any input from faculty staff which led to some unsatisfactory feeling after some peer reviewsother than that it was a great opportunity to make a very interesting research and analysis in the framework of what we have learn in the topics of microeconomics macroeconomics and data presentation	2
instructions were very unclear compared to the rest of the courses in the specialization	1
more theoretical analytical and intuition is not much developed good for getting familiar with switch mode converter circuits	2
a disorganized mess got no acknowledgement that i was turning in assignments my peerreview assignment for week  was done the first week was never peered reviewed or peerreviewed completed three weeks all assignments exactly as instructed god only knows if anything has been received or credited i hate myself for getting suckered into this awful thing bye coursera	0
very informative i like the pace but get the impression that the instructors never see our work while peer review is awesome professional review would be very helpful	3
some questions in the quiz are not helpful for learning more about the topic for example how does it help the learner to be able to answer what question the shirt of the presenter has seriously	1
sir is an amazing teacher and expresses his ideas very clearly	3
have completed  weeks and find the course very goodlot of effort to build the content very clear and detailed and explanation and if you repeat it yourself while going thru the lecture the concepts will be get much more clearerprogramming is all about practice but this could be a very good starting point	3
the conclusions in the course are not convincing or at least not presented in a convincing way i have many doubts about the argument given in the lectures and i myself can offer many counterexamples and counterarguments i just cannot believe in rajs theories when they are so weak and therefore this course will in no way increase my level of happiness	2
this is an advanced course and there are a lot of things that geoffrey hinton talks about casually which one has to read more about on ones own the knowledge and clarity of the instructor is beyond doubt top notch this course if quiet exhaustive and perhaps the best course on neural networks	4
the course is very interesting the jupiter notebook is very usefuli dont like that many examples are very usspecific some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside usaupdate im lowering my grade from  stars to  stars because of very confusing assignments often its not clear the requirement of the task it takes very long to understand also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures	2
really disappointing course content is shallow despite the impressive credentials of the professor quizzes are ridiculously easy	0
very useful course i really wanted to find such information thank you	4
its an excellent basic course for anyone keen on equines the best thing about it was interaction in assignments and peer marking	3
very informative and helpful to both students and professionals	4
very fun and great ways to understand various tools that can apply in our education sector	4
a very good course  trustworthy	3
the course need more improvement in the case of videos and always updates	1
i thought this was going to be a more comprehensive course about crowdsourcing and using social media to aid the design process maybe i missed something but it fell a little short of the mark for me	2
good assignments	3
it is really hard fun to make games and i am blessed to have this specialization course	4
whenever i read and try to understanding about statistic i feel its very difficult and confusing but with the simple method of this video to teach me about statistic now i feel that my love parameter about statistic is increased thank you very much	4
this was a good solid intro course got a good working understanding of the python program basics out of this he taught less about programming basics ie not a completely intro computing class than another python course i tried which is what i wanted probably wouldnt be the class to recommend if this is your first programming class worktime expectations were as listed	3
well presented	4
after finishing week  i have decided to stick with duke universitys medical neuroscience which is starting up again i also highly recommend understanding the brain the neurobiology of everyday life which i believe was taught by the university of chicago i found them to be far more engaging the viewer and the format to be much easier to follow i found it visually disturbing and also have to keep pausing to read the slide before it switchesits too bad because i was really looking forward to this course it also seemed she had trouble pronouncing many of the words and i do not want to learn how to pronounce many of them incorrectly also many of the slides did not have an english translation on them	0
very grateful to take this	4
this course had too much content in onerun and some of the topicassignments had too much confusing questions and answers which were hard to figure out made this course a bit a bad experience the same goes for the endassignment project where much functionality was required within a short time  and the course was delayed so many of the students could not fit it into their schedule	1
the professor spews the material like reading poetry the material is disorganized jumping from one topic to another and back the quizzes are just plain dumb containing questions like what article was written by authors x y z the homework is barely related to the material and one of them the one that made me abandon wasting further time with this class consists of wasting a huge amount of time days configuring parameters and running an application over and over again to tune themwaiting up to ten minutes on my i machine to make one pass over the data my impression is that this guy didnt spend any time to prepare this course and just used the materialhomework from a more advanced class that he did previously you will not learn almost anything by taking this class as none of the topics is explained well and is the opposite of self contained just a huge waste of time	0
its incredible to be able to take these courses at home i cant thank you enough for offering these course for free thank you	4
the instructor is not very good when compared to the others that are involved in this specialization	1
the great one	4
there are better free courses out there to learn basic inferential statistics khan academy is a great place to start and udacity has a great class that gives a good intuitive understanding the main reason to take this class is if you are trying to finish the entire data science program otherwise look elsewhere for an intro stats class the instructor clearly knows the material the class just does not do a good job of transfering that knowledge	0
interesting but very introductory dont expect to really learn something significant easy course accent is hard to understand	2
i wanted to ask but it is not possible there are not chat or discussióni think this course is interesting but i need to learn more english first and i realy realy want to know it how i can to know the profits payoffs by my company	3
i very much enjoyed this course however the tests at the end of each week were not always absolute answers in many cases several answers could be considered as corect depending on political views	3
this is a good course for learning about the reasons rules and methods of virtual instruction but i think some more interactivity and an increase in the number of in video quizzes would help i also think more screen shots and a greater number of screen changes would improve the experience	2
very easy to understand and its very helpful	3
the most weak part is automatical grading when structure and semantics are essential text inside tag is not guessing if exists space between elements isnt acceptable as well also its difficult to check when long code snippets should be pasted as plan text in short text field better to use file uploading with required snippet for me also not enough accent was on html  features with dedicated examples how use new tags and attributes	2
the professor is excellent i enjoyed this course solely because of professor wright if you have a positive outlook on buddhism but do not know the ins and outs of the religionpractice i do not recommend this course i have a totally different outlook on it now that i wish i didnt have it is interesting information but the essays are in depth and difficultand there is no chance to even purchase a certificate	2
short simplistic could be done in a week very much a beginners course for those who have not mindfully observed the game worlds in which they play the student may come away with a few new ideas and the greatest value is in having peers review the homework assignments worth the time if you quickly breeze through it	2
it consists mostly of video lectures there is a lack of coding exercises	1
a complete overview about the theoretical and new approaches considering diabetes in the world	4
very nice introduction in the private equity world i like that the differences are explained between the anglosaxon an european systems	2
waste of time and money	0
not happy about course    got cancelled	0
submit button wasnt working for assignment assignment was heavily weighted on mobile app which was the least pertinent part of the course for me generally seemed disorganized	0
 weeks long this is basically his class syllabus transferred to a mooc the first video was a ridiculous waste of my time the videography was totally unprofessional shaky camera this long walk and football kicking with a brain on the football field the audio is horrible use a mic i signed up for a neuro course not an advertisement of the campus this guy needed an instructional designer to help him condense and build this course into something digestible this is mooc not a college course i am horribly disappointed at the quality i needed an overview of the main components of neuro medical science	0
i generally think the course needs a lot of improvement as after week  the assignments and quizzes dont seem to relate to the course content we are at very different levels so a more gentle easing and explanation of ideas is necessary other than this apparent quantum leap from one stage to the next i have had to do a different course else where and i am getting the sort of good introduction into the r language its not practical to expect everyone to understand the ideas in  weeksprogramming is hard enough as it is	0
great course to understand the oil and gas industry	3
i can see a couple of problems in this course how to access and change elements in a data frame especially the use of loc and iloc is not explained very well and i believe there is an error in the slides the second thing is that i have found more powerful methods in pandas documentation for example assign or nlargest and nsmallest this is not really a problem if one of the hidden purposes is to push students to actively search the docs for what they would like to dowork load for the assignments is just fine in my opinion not too little not too muchoverall i am satisfied	3
not well presented at all great disappointment	0
this course just for a newbie	1
was quite good but getting less and less useful too abstract lacking detail examples too academic needs to be more practical	2
it definitively could be a whole lot better look and learn from udacitys nanodegree	2
not very challenging will be more better if there are case studies in the quiz and we answer questions applying the knowledge from the video lectures to the case studies	1
bad instructor	0
i am learning basic things of pythonits very help full and going cool u know i mean not boring subject is very logical and interestingthank you coursera	4
definitely not a course for a beginners very confusing the part with the javascript is a real horror for beginners and even challenging for some newly programmers	0
the course a materials are interesting and with significant value same comment on the teachers this would be perfect if the third partythe vm is working fine i cant say im happy about the course where the frustration is probably the right word describing my feeling right now wish me luck for this week i might pass might not 	1
way too much videos and too little handson learning felt like the course mostly taught you to remember stuff and not actually learning a skill though i broke the course early	0
this course is solely for teachers on how to tech art to elementary school pupils very basic most of the content is available on the momas website disappointing	1
funny easy  extremely useful	4
is this entire course going to be watching videos of powerpoint slideshows wrapped in a rather buggy website	1
all tribunals and courts in the hague are mentioned in this course but the iranunited states claims tribunal	3
i liked the course overall but assignments are so easy compared to the material given in lectures	3
i do not recommend this course if you want to be taught intuitively the slides are mostly just a list of bullet points with very few intuitive figures or charts normally figurescharts are easier to understand and remember even the simple ones you are just fed with lots of concepts throughout the course but in the end you are suddenly required to do some practical c programming in contiki an embedded os which you need to spend some time to figure out quite a number of practical issues just for a successful run	0
so many powerpoint slides its very boring course the tutor just read slides without deep explanations wikipedia much more interesting its just observing course theoretical 	0
great course the classes and teacher are very qualified the only flaw that i found was the tests specially the last one seems that the questions in portuguese werent translated correctly	3
so much useful information in this one course i have a working knowledge of basic seo practices	4
discussion forums for this course was not quite helpful	2
no one is here for review my work	2
not a bad intro i dont know if anyone would benefit taking this as a standalone or for an entire  weeks for that matter still it introduced some solid concepts for professionals and scholars alike	2
this course is very interesting with well thoughtout content that involves the student very actively from the first lesson the assignments are challenging but also very exciting i consider is a unique innovation in mooc courses the professor give excellent information interspersed with interesting case studies unfortunately there was no interaction in my iteration of the course or any apparent involvement whatsoever from any tas or mentors all questions remained unanswered except by other students and frustrated calls for help and advice were ignored the majority of the courses mark  is determined by fellow students using a rubric which leaves little true wiggle room between pass and fail marks the mystery cases on which we worked during the course were never resolved or explained in any way which would have been nice after the effort that went into them i would recommend the content of the course for fun but if anyone is looking for an accurate assessment of material learned try another course	1
hope recommend some more reading	2
not sure how this course is usefull	1
overall a good crash course and introduction to r its a lot to learn in  weeks and some of the assignments were challenging which i liked i think the course is worth taking but i do wish the material and assignments were packaged better  more aligned just be prepared to spend a lot of time online reading researching and learning some concepts on your own dont expect to learn everything from the lectures and materials to be successful in this course	2
the first three courses in this duke series were superbly well done i have taken numerous courses from harvard and johns hopkins and none of them compare in quality of execution of the first three duke courses in this seriesand then there was bayesian statistics much of the instruction in this course was truly awful the quality of the slides and video and so on was still excellent but the teaching was horrible vast amounts of totally unexplained jargon and very extensive equations were thrown at the students with the apparent assumption that the course was a review for postdoctoral statistics students when material is beyond the scope of what perspective students can reasonably be expected to understand faculty members should be honest enough to just say so rather than pretending to teach the subject matteri appreciate very much what the duke faculty achieved in the first three courses but the treatment of bayesian statistics that i have just suffered through was shameful	0
dr chuck is very good at teaching the concepts and makes the lectures interesting	4
great course loved the interaction between peers and they marking your work was irritating at first but shows you the mistake we all make thinking that others should buy into your idea but it gives you a slight glimpse into how the community might view it from their side	4
detailed information about the course has been provided in this thanks	4
very disappointed with the information provided i went through the second week completing all assignments and quizzes but did not learn anything new most of the information provided is common knowledge anymore i was also a little put off by the frequent self promotions by the instructor in reference to his treatment center organizations and book i am withdrawing from the class	0
being in the medical field its very useful course for me to understand ehr and other healthcare information	4
the teachers doesnt seem to enjoy beeing there the all seem like the faster we do this the sooner it will be finished	0
dear mr landersmany thanks for your efforts and help to improve our email writing styles	3
awesome course fascinating information and stunning imagery	4
excellent well structured thanks alot	4
basically this course was an excellent promotion of pwc as a consultant a well crafted introduction of buzzwords with very little substance unlike the following courses on excel and presentations	0
too few students	2
unlike the very first course for beginners there is a little bit more content here so i put  stars however i still found the pace was too slow with too much distraction funny videos teacher drinking and making mistakes hummm  it is ok to be relaxed as long as the course delivers content in proportion to what has been paid  i strongly believe this specialisation cycle should actually take one or maximum two courses not  with the capstone i am planning to move forward with python and to keep reading the booklet which is good i like the introduction about the http xml json and sql databases but sorry dr chuck i will not complete this specialisation it is overpriced for what it is 	1
as a social media user and new to marketing in this area this course offered a great get started overview and actionable steps to start working on a plan to reach my high value market i would recommend this course particularly the paid version highly its worth the investment so far	4
a very big difficulty for me french people who uses to speak english everyday for may work is that  teachers dont do any effort to speak slower and to articulate as with all other courses ive attended in english its impossible to read a transcription even in english while reading slidesslides are not sufficient by themselves ie without commentary beside the workaround ive used is to print french translation or english transcription and read it trying to guess which part suited with which slide for a nonfree course its not really professional 	1
great material and opportunity to expand your math skills	4
there are better courses than this for example yale game theoryyoutube explanation is not good	1
lets try and draw a very basic simple apple i had to stop watching this course there sorry but this is less than fundamentals im trying a new course on graphic design now	1
platitudes and generalizations the interviews with real people are the only redeeming factor i wasnt impressed	1
i think that the simply reading slides doesnt help people understand the idea is to make this courses as accessible as possible	0
very clear and organized i will certainly make use of what i learned when writing programs or designing software	3
best course thanks drchuck	4
course is too simple should be more extensive	2
a great course for beginners but there was too much detail for submitting assignments	3
very well organised lessons were clear and homework were interesting	3
this course was a good refresher of mathematical and statistical concepts i found the mathematical and statistical concepts applied to modelling interesting i never knew that what i learned in high school in the past can actually be used to come up with models to solve business problems some videos were a bit long though	2
as a java programmer with some  years industry experience i quickly got lost on this course it might not be the course  it could be me it might be that i am too long in the tooth as an oo programmer that i cannot cope with the transition to functional programmingi found the video lectures initially well structured and stepped nicely in to increasing complexity without losing me but eventually i fell completely behind and by the time i was performing the exercise  submission i was in deep water there are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which i did not likeas a real world programmer i have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory and i struggle to understand how performing this exercise prepares me for realworld scala programming either i just do not see the point of creating code that can add and subtract numbers without using number types i could write a wrapper for int in java in  minutes doing this abstract scala exercise would take me all day and i still do not understand the code nor the point of doing it whatever happened to maintainability principles i have now lost all interest in completing the course because by week  i might as well be doing a course in advanced arabic i cannot continue this course now because i cannot complete the exercises i am disheartened and not sure whether this is a reflection of scala or the course or both i would be reticent to take a job with scala	0
toughest of all  very tough	2
a very weak course gives very little knowledge of grammar doesnt really explain quite a lot of things if you are a first year primary school student this course might be helpful otherwise a complete waste of time	0
great course but there was too little content double it  or double the coursework make us do more work also tell people to use parfor to speed up the computationsotherwise great course	2
the professors know what they are doing but not good at making the concepts plain to the students who dont have the strong background most of the times i would just ask myself why they did this and that but later they dont provide enough explanations	1
doesnt have to be that complicated with command prompt actions from the beginning of the course that make the motivation drop very fast	0
interesting course gives a good initial notion of how the eu workstwo written peergraded assignments are cool its very interesting to read peers submissions from all over the world i got ones from spain china and usa major drawback the slides are mostly bright pictures it would be nice to make the slides more informative and available for download	3
its a short but good course good instructions and delivery good introduction to big data and ml on gcp would have liked more assignments as a formal requirement to complete the course the codelabs are disconnected from the course glad to know other courses in the specialization are under development	3
overall this course is tough for me in my opinion the course title is not suitable which is introduction the word introduction generally means something basic and fundamental however the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hardfurthermore the assignment instructions are not clear enough ie what steps need to be followed to complete each question so it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum i know in each week forum there is one discussion specifically for assignment ie assignment x tips which is good but i think the forum is not a good place since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out not in an easy to follow ordermoreover i do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures i mean it is too many new things in the assignment although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves in general the assignments should at least reflect the lectureslastly in my humble opinion this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages though the title is introduction	1
way too much way too fast not sure how i would make it better but i felt like i was learning from googling more than from the course	1
the course is wellstructured and useful thank you	4
took this as part of a java specialization but would not have taken it otherwise	2
this course is to much about graphlab and not enough about the mechanics of machine learning	1
just wish to have some concept check before taking the quiz	2
i am really disappointed with the content of this course if what youre looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat maybe this course is for you if however you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies toddlers and young children or youd like to know how their needs change over time this course is not for you i was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to cheweat difficult things ex whole apples i wanted to know at what ageweight you switch to  milk i wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time i wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddlers diet and what if any extra vitamins should be added i wanted tips on weaning if youre still nursing a toddler i guess i just wanted morein addition the quizzes are so easy as to be silly actual quiz question and correct answer which is not a good way to approach grocery shopping if healthy choices are desired answer visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first come on did i need a stanford university course to tell me that onewhile the instructor is knowledgeable this course is geared toward someone with no knowledge not someone who wants to gain a deeper understanding the videos are painfully slow am i waiting for a doodle here and i could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos and the recipes good god i dont think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top if shed upped the game showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding say chia seeds different fruits flax etc and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast that would have been a useful topicim just hugely disappointed this course is best suited to perhaps a health department not to someone seeking college level information about a topic that matters to their childrens lives	0
thanks andrew ng	2
the course was interesting but i would have appreciated more academically rigorous assessments as the course is currently designed you either get  or 	1
great course with wide coverage really liked numerous real life examples primarily historical ones 	4
i am so glad to take this course and share stakeholders  as a strategy more than a theorythanks	3
the lectures are very wellorganized the topics are also cover in this field however the lectures are very dry and boring the main professor were reading the scripts on the monitor from my perspective with his knowledge in this field as being described on his personal web site he should be able to talk comfortably by looking at the topic on the slide then discuss about it in detail i would suggest to change the environment to be at the wide open space like coffee shop to make this course more attractive im sorry it is not what i expected	0
it is really good	4
while this was one of the better courses ive done on coursera the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin weve also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin again without any communication this was a good course but i would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation	0
this is a good course and you get an overview of a lot of interesting topics however as you advance further in the course some of the math begins to lose consistency while some of it just gets skipped	2
for me this is too artificial	1
not for new programmers the lecture material is also not logically organized and does not correspond to the assignments	0
it gave me some new insights in how to work smarter	3
the class and the content is very good but the way that the professor teachs is kind of boring for me	2
waste of time	0
it was a bit confusing to understand the topics and try to learn them by heart	2
theres a lot of detailed information here but its surface level at best i dont feel i have a better understanding of how smartphones workalthough i am now more familiar with the tech components of a few smartphone models and the timeline of iosandroid os development i am not able to connect this information outside of base facts im not even sure how the smartphone components fit together or what they actually doit would be a really interesting course if there were more examples such as how smartphone components work together or a deeper comparison between the ios and android systems is used when discussing the development timeline of each model instead of pure cognitive knowledge being read from a slidemaybe these concepts are explored further in the other courses for this certificate but as a stand alone introduction to smartphone technologies the information is poorly imparted	1
this course covers basic and advance knowledge about cameras and photography that is what a new photographer needs in his starting days	3
perfect bases knowledge for wind energy covering all parts of wind energy industry and science	4
very few amount of exercise and very small gain of knowledge from capstone	1
excellent presentation and planification and very useful book from the teacher	4
thank you	4
positive very interesting and informative lectures and subject matternegative fellow students who have no knowledge of the subject other than what they themselves are learning are required to submit case studies for peer review by other students who have no more knowledge of the subject than they do these case studies are heavily weighted and if the person is reviewed negatively for whatever reason they must resubmit it never knowing why they were given low scores or what the correct answer should have been no instructor assistance is given huge turnoff for me and many of my fellow students i want to withdraw drop this class and take another with more clearly drawn parameters	0
i did all four courses  the whole specialization each course in itself was aright and i learned new things however the course certificate is meaningless it neither states the content nor the effort for example the hours instead it even says noncredit course this is despite the fact that the course equates  pdus and counts towards the uci project management certificate programm as it was described in the faq i feel betrayed how can i apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere	0
very good material gave me a better understanding of not only project management but also how to join into a project and having the final goal and the larger picture in mind	3
this was a really boring course not for the contet bu the teacher i fell bored every video because the theacher was really slow in everything tha she was showing it is realy dificult to get focussed in the real topics when the teacher spend a lot of time explaining things at the end wont be evaluated as an example i am not english native speaker but a had to put the playback speed to x in order to not get bored in all videos it was really dificult to follow the teacher at the normal velocity  i just got sleep every video and as a record i really like this topic so it is the tacher i took the first course and it was a good experience but this one is owfull	0
very good introduction in machine learning	4
dont get me wrong this is a good course the teacher obviously knows his stuff and delivers the information in a good way it gives you what you need to know but i expected more a wider grasp on things additional readings quizs related articles links and so on maybe not mandatory but in addition to what already is there	2
great course	4
instructor voice is too low and intro music is too highvideo quality is badcourse content is for very beginners people beginners to programming not only to swiftsorry to say it but this course is really bad does not deserve to be in this specialization	0
its a decent course not as thorough as analytics edge or machine learning by andrew ng	2
some of the videos werent as clear as the previous courses videos i suggest less gimmicks and more focus on learning the history i will admit there were times i was lost on the quizzes because the videos werent clear enough	2
varied and wellexplained that held my interest throughout my only criticism is the english in some of the written quizzes especially in the final exam needs reviewing by native speaker as some of the answers are ambiguous when they do not properly explain the context of the situation	3
very informative	4
nice for a beginner	3
excellent course very well organized	4
excellent course for a beginner in this subject	4
good course but i have a strong feeling that would be nice to have more focus on the practice some lecture not really much with the results of assignments good course anyway pavel	2
the instructor keeps repeating the same information throughout all the lectures it is not as impactful as i thought it would be the last straw was her saying thatthat was an article	0
this is a joke	0
ok but obvious for someone who has worked with data science	2
i am very happy to be able to refresh learning more of this skill as i will not know when things can happen i would like to be able to do something if it does even when there are particular help groups to sweep on the field so to speaklearning the skills gives me the confidence that i can make a difference however small it may bethanks a lot for boosting my knowledge	3
repetitive content with other moma courses seeing thru pictures duh not gonna pay  for this 	0
thoroughly enjoyed learning more about ancient rome the lectures are a great overview of the history of rome with great insight from the archaeology im an architect and i really appreciated the connection between architecture and the culture of rome i didnt realize how much of a archaeology rockstar dr soren was until i watched the bbc documentary thanks to the leaders of the course and lana	3
good one  expected more exercise or assignment 	3
excellent highly valuable life changing presented in an enjoyable fresh way 	3
this course gives introduction of plenty of artworks from moma but it will be more interesting if it shows more details and explanations about the artwork itself or the background of the time and the society	1
great introduction to python	4
they just throw all the material at you without giving you enough explanations or exercises this situation gets worse in the last two weeks and you can hardly breathe it is like okay now we have learned that  lets talk about calculus	2
its not difficult maybe im major in history so i find this course very interesting	4
nice insigh to the brain and how it works the course have inspired me to study a lot more different aspects about the brain and as a result about myself	4
the course is very much focused in the method of dcf but there is a lack of information regarding how to apply it to startups in practice	1
the graphics and language used in this course are easy to understand even new terms are well defined through context clues and visual cues i have already learned and applied so many of the things ive learned and im even helping my fiancé get through his graduate classes more effectively this semester	4
theory is too much	2
the course offers just a simple running of interesting and useful code but doesnt put the student in the situation of thinking and creating ideas and code	1
i hope the instructions were cleary and not too vague that it was open to many interpretation an example would have helped and the rubricscriteria for grading should have been shown beforehand so students would be guided what points they would consider when making their piece	1
personally did not like the pace of the course the course can be a bit more interesting with reallife case studies	1
huge waste of time they will give you very little information and what is expected for you to be able to do with that information is astronomical you will never learn any of the details of how computing works how functions work the mechanism behind these computations or anything to give you an example you will first watch a horribly made video on boolean logic alter going to youtube to get a better explanation of and or  and not youll see an example done with if else and elif then be asked to do homework problems using and or not this huge gap between the information given and the information you are expected to know to solve the problems they give you is too large i found differential equations easier than this	0
very interesting course although lacks course notes the final test week  had a few questions which werent covered in the lesson	2
this a well paced class which does a good job of breaking down the fundamentals of project management cost accounting	2
i think it is a very basic course or for people who have very little previous knowledge the concepts are not very clear it may not be appropriate for a person who already has college education	1
some of the discussion of c programming was a little incoherent and occasionally wrong but not in ways that would affect what you learn about arduino programming but otherwise the course was a blast and it got me very interested in taking more iot classes professor harriss enthusiasm for the material comes through very clearly i definitely recommend it	4
while the course is very interesting i found the peer review process unsatisfying i did not enjoy grading others without knowing if i was right grading a fellow student on their accuracy when i dont know if they are actually wrong is something i never want to do again after completing the course i had hoped to learn if any of my assignments were actually correct i am disappointed in the outcome	0
this course doesnt offer much of a learning curve i would rather suggest taking data visualization using tableau by duke university	0
interesting and well presented information i wished the course had been more interactive and had spent more time on the chemistry of nutrition also the lectures and quizzes could have been longer	2
boring voice a lot of overcomplicated terms where you can describe your idea in a much more simple way in result i feel that lector read this material not to teach people but just to read it disgusting	0
it is a very interesting course i was quite takenthe teacher is good in her solos and quite good while in the group i dindt really like the massive use of the terms kind of often used to explain concepts and for this reason i still have to finish iti will quickly cause i m looking forward to learning something else	2
while a lot of useful ground was covered it was a constant struggle simply getting my environment to work properly  the entire specialisation needs to do a better job of getting users on a level playing field with better environment setup	1
nicely done only thing is its very american a lot of the recipes and tips are too elementary would have loved some more ideas on what to cook how to cook etc	4
felt somewhat light on substance	1
hi i am an it specialist  years experience i undertook the course so i could learn about ibm bluemix and iot development and extend my skillsunderstanding of the environment however i have very little good to say about this course offering i had numerous issues with what was offeredthe videos were generally ok but some had poor audio there was minimal video compared to any other course i have done and more detail and discussion in videos would have been more helpfulsome of the video material is out of date already as i suspect bluemix layout has changed  this made navigation a bit confusingthe downloadable pi image has changed since the course was prepared and the newer image has different code as standard i ended up having to muddlethrough manually loading packages and dependencies etc to get things to worki lost many hours trying to debug and rework assignment code just to get it to work for the grader tool this was further complicated by not having good debug output from the grader to work with naturally some of the grader fails were my own fault but the majority of issues i ran in to could have been avoided by better worded assignments andor more detail about requirementslastly it was taking sometimes days to get any response to requests for guidance on the forums  discussions in fact i think the majority of useful assistance came from other students who had run in to the same issues when you have a course that is such a short time frame you really need to be providing assistance in a timely manneri could not in any good faith recommend anyone take this course in the future  which is a little saddening i do thank the lecturers for their efforts thus far and sincerely hope they can either improve or drop this course offering in the future	0
i think that i would like to be more concrete on topics the teacher explain very well but then there is not that amount of concrete examples so the classes gets very theorical	2
i would like to express my gratitude to prof muppala for this incredible coursethere are indeed many great resources for learning any of the technologies and tools used in this course and specialization but what is unique about this specialization is that it gives us not only solid foundations needed to use these tools but just as importantly a clear context as to where a certain tool or its segment is used sure enough having in mind the broader context it is much easier to understand all of the segments individuallyi would also like to thank krešimir and all the other mentors that helped make this course a pleasant experiencei cant wait for the next course on angular js to start	4
simple to understand	2
this class started out very rocky and the videos had errors the quizzes had problems and the assignments had a poor grading system hopefully these will be corrected in future offerings	2
never thought i would enjoy programming as i just believed my brain didnt work that way but how wrong was i i am simply amazed at how well the instructor subtly but quickly builds on previous slides to increase your understanding so that after six weeks you thoroughly grasp the very basic fundamentals	4
very helpful course thank you very much	4
good course but very highleve	2
good for beginners i am not sure if anyone who has designed even a small game in unity will be interested in this course i was quite bored and had to go through all the videos just to complete the assignment which cannot be completed if you dont go through all the videos which i think is the drawback for this course but again its for beginners as for me i am looking forward to interesting and indepth topics to learn about the specialization will hold no value if it doesnt pose any challenge to its pursuers	2
too brief to learn	1
there are ideas we are all familiar with in this course good ones for a new teacher who may be oblivious but there is little concrete information about what those ideas look like in a class setting for example there might be a discussion of leadership or respect but no ideas about what those look like its a lot of teacher talk with no substance	0
the instructors may be knowledgeable but they had no knack for teaching	0
amazing and very entertaining introduction to machine learning it has interesting labs and the theory is explained clearly	4
bad logicclass content poorly related to the exams no exercise for practice when any clearly unrelevant the first  weeks it is hard to impossible to succeed through the exam run all videos set first then consider digging into practicei took a book and learned more form it than this video	0
its a difficult course with some hard topics on neurophysiology for people with no background on biology on the other hand its a great challenge for everyone interested on brain decision making	2
it is a poor course because is not properly designed for internationals language is mainly french in slides and subtitle is not that helpfulinstead of spending time outside to read the notes it was better to prepare helpful slides for students to understand better what you are talking about	0
the course was well designed i liked the structure of the course due to my procrastination problem i enroll for the coursera courses now and then but middle of the session i drop out from each of the course this is the first in coursera that retained my interest to finish the course i loved the concept of pomodoro chunking techniques that have been taught in this course im looking forward to apply these techniques not only in my professional career but also in my lifelong learning process happy learning everyone	4
its a good practical lecture but i think it have lots of room to improve the material itself can be covered in  weeks lecture	1
very interesting course great videos and instructors t	4
assignments are very easy and there arent easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos	2
very nice introductory course broad explanation of traditional logic gates and synthesis tools graded exercises and practice exercises are chosen perfectly to grasp the topic	3
good course got chance to read some interesting stories while reviewing peers discovered what i was doing wrong while writing stories	3
i only did week one of the course and quit for the following reasonspresentation of the content is too fast and provides little information among lots of noise most of whats said is generic keywords assembled in sentences that dont make much sense or implies common sense evidences barely illustrated with vague figures and no sources to support them it makes everything hard to follow for beginners and unconvincing for more advanced studentson top of that i feel offended by the mysogynist examples and the underlying contradictory assumptions that designers outside of agile are basically incompetent while saying at the same time that they will just use methods they already know anyway	0
really loving this course lots of new information to apply to my life and work	4
awful course the lectures in no way prepare you for the final assignment which is supposed to take two hours the course consists of really boring videos of the instructor using galaxy and in no way teaches you anything about using galaxy or how it works the lectures and quizzes are a joke you can pass the quizzes just by watching the videos i got to the final assignment and had no clue what to do if you i know nothing about bioinformatics or ngs which is why i took and paid for this stupid course so i spent weeks on the final assignment and i still could not finish or pass the course whoever allows this course to still exist and waste peoples time and take their money should be ashamed of themselves read the discussion forums and youll see what im talking abut do not take this course	0
amazing absolutely invaluable thanks dr chuck	4
great course it was insightful yet everything was polished and on point the knowledge and the tools are really useful for someone who is a beginner and interested in financial analysis	3
could benefit from harder assignments or more	2
good informative and precise thank you prof doug thomas	3
hated the course and the content i truly regret investing my money on this course	0
i was terribly disappointed in this course mr onuf spends the majority of these lectures implying what jefferson thinks without discussing much in the way of actual history further the course seems more of a commercial for the university of virginia than anything else overall a waste of time	0
great breadth of detail i learned a lot	4
teachers poorly prepared explanations ambiguous it seems that they didnt pay attention to examples and sound of the coursei love jack wu written tutorials way better than videos	0
this is a great course for beginners in programmingi strongly recommend taking this course	4
does a good job of covering the basics in my case im looking for more of a refresher rather than learning the concepts for the first time	3
unfortunately no tutorsinstructors present to supervise the course which made inconsistencies between course material slides videos and solutions calculated for assignments horribly annoying to deal with especially for someone like me new to the topic further the solver addin needed for the week  assignment is not consistent across different excel versions and libre calc which resulted in a whole lot of guesswork to pass this assignment im sorry to say the course never came close to my expectations despite the very interesting topic would not recommend	1
excellent course very easy to follow and puts up some good challenges and george is very knowledgable	4
very easy to understand perfect for beginners	4
not as much practical as the other python courses provided in this series the coding assignment is quite easy since the code has been already written the only thing you have to do is run it	2
this course need some odifications because of cloudera version	2
a most excellent introduction to machine learning	4
not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuffwe do all the work the instructor does little or nonetoo much peer rating stuff which i despise and there seems to be no way to unenroll	0
this is a very good learning series for python beginners the course has been designed beautifully in a way to keep you interested throughout its span the quiz and the assignments are both simple and at the same time enough to provide a brief revision for the entire lecture	4
poorly designed no help whatsoever from the staff forum is totally worthless worst course i ever had on coursera	0
wonderfully insightful and relevant contents i could apply them to my company fully 	4
in general this was an easy interesting and enjoyable course video interviews and lectures by key researchers in this exciting field were a highlight its an introductory course so not deep but funa couple of things significantly detracted from the course for meone was a feeling of unqualified evangelism i think the microbiome is indeed a hugely important field but the level of hype here and lack of any critical perspective was offputting this is particularly disturbing for products like probiotics which have become a huge industry with little solid evidence to support them or to choose between them also they devote a lot of time to selling the american gut project which is a good cause but i would rather they had spent that time teaching me something useful i resent being duped into watching ads when ive signed up to be educatedthe other thing that bothered me was the course required us to divulge a lot of personal information to other students in pointless timeconsuming projects i didnt learn anything from these projects and found them annoying	2
thanks for teaching python in easy way i have learnt a lot for this course keep learning	4
auditing is pretty useless with how this class is updated i cant get peer reviews so my assignments get zero feedback coursera didnt used to be like thisasked about how to be more involved in class discussions and peer reviews a couple days ago and havent received feedback	0
not so practical	2
good as a start	2
good introduction to python it gets you into the mindset of programming and combining syntax to do something useful the videos could be more to the point and better quality though	3
as a beginner to the subject i feel like i know even less if that was possible after just the first few weeks i plan to start again sometime in the future and see if i can figure things out in this course after i learn about buddhism somewhere else first	0
too abstract with too much general information	2
the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate on the proposed timeframe it was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers  a lack of understanding of how coursera works its clear they did not care to adapt to a  week course and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over  weeks to get done further to the course timeframe the assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions which is very strange in a course for coaching not the mention video quality that is scary i could not watch the videos and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions	0
the intro video just really put me off sorry	0
very very high altitude introduction presented in a seemingly confused way with a lot of product placement	1
the female presenters speed of speech is so slow its almost hard to concentrate onthe questions where answers need to be filled in are so stupid that you can fill in any random letters or punctuations and itll count as passlike the comics	0
the course is great but i am very disappointed that after spend  hours watching the videos and practicing i can only submit my answer if i upgrade this should be said before i enrolled in this course	0
not a course that helps you solve wicked problems which do not have solutions that will come suddenly one fine day and ones that require more thought effort and brainstorming	0
ive had to guess a lot of things video explanations were not up to the level of the assignments i dont look for easier assignments but broader explanationsthe last week assignment on crowdsourcing its cool but for example mechanical turk take hrs to validate you before you could start so if you start the assignment on friday youll barely make it and if you had time until saturdaybecause you work you are doomed	1
why is this review never stored	3
no use for me no music examples because copyrights did not allow so the course is pretty boringsorry not for me	0
i can not unenroll this course its very terrible	0
good instruction but it was a bit too basic  many of these concepts are common sense to most people in college or beyond	2
this course needs much more evidences and examples to support the valuable information	1
please show the quiz answers for verification purpose since we have to buy the course to submit answers	2
a great course to start it bridges between design thinking and agile i found that very valuable especially for product owners who need to understand what prescrum activities are requiredhelpful in their role ie it doesnt make sense to define what you want before you know what you needsome of the videos have a bit of lengths if youre already familiar with the topic but that might be part of the didactics for beginnersthe quizzes sometimes seem to be a bit awkward  ie maybe they arent very obvious for nonnative speakers while they are for native speakers its often littel details or rather the tone of the sentence that seems to make it the right answerthe access to templates etc is great although they are available in the internet anyway if you know where to lookthe skits remind me the tv distance learning for english in the ies in germany i find the funny but not as usefull as they could be but i like the idea	3
although it is a very informative class and chrissy is a good teacher i am finding this class to be extremely troublesome unless one possesses the means to purchase a great deal of equipment and product to work within pro tools it should be noted that pro tools first the free version i downloaded is a detriment to learning in this course and will effect your grade negatively i am also dismayed by the lack of community participation in the forums on other berklee  coursera classes this hasnt been nearly as much of a problem	1
short and sweet the course is quite short but covers the true essentials of conflict resolution in a professional environment the only reason why i did not give five stars the concept of active listening although mentioned all over the course is not really well explained	3
great professors thank you so much	4
this was a really good training thank you	3
fantastic course im so happy i took this class	3
its not an intro class but you can practice a lot if you know something	2
quizes are getting better with every course lectures are good i like the idea of assignments  to show your work and to see works of others only one thing id like to get review not only from other students buy from at least one professional its nice to get opinion from masses but id like to know professional opinion and directions where i could move to be better photographer	3
a course graded only by your peers  whats the point  well the peers that graded my answers are not qualified to grade my work useless wast of time grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr	0
excellent project implement your learning and see the results very well planned as the last exercise	4
thank you so much for this course it was very helpful	4
interisting course to get a first idea about wind energy	3
i did not find the course very good i came into the class with only real basic knowledge of python and i was hoping to be able to pick up more as part of this class while i might have picked up more it was only because i used resources outside the coursethe video instructions in programming in python left quite a few gaps to figure out by reading documentation the videos themselves were divided into two sections  first a theoretical or classroom like section and a second a labprogramming section going over some coding in python the classroom type lectures were pretty reasonably good but the labprogramming were pretty terriblethey instructor really break down the syntax of the code and just left the student to figure it out this made being able to take this code and to adapt it to other uses very difficulti would not recommend this as a course to help learn python	0
the speaker was very difficult to follow with dialogue flow random pauses and stumbling over words the rate of the speakers speech was also very fast the material was very useful and informative otherwise	2
i did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week i feel that you could have offered a more detailed description  doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers	2
eh not great to be honest	2
i loved the approach of the course and the peer review activities i think that for such a theme it was fantastic to have multiple experts give their opinions and ideas about the subject at hand i am looking forward for more courses like this	4
introductory course mostly around installation and setup for the other courses in specializations	1
the course if wellorganized and the instructors do a very good job however three weeks of slides and theory and then only the last two weeks of seeing code hardly makes the course projectcentered in my mind also requiring learners to upgrade to run an autograder on a quiz is ridiculous	1
a nice introduction	4
it has a good level but there is room for improvement keep on the good work thanks	2
the course is a very quick run through of basic statistics and not very intuitive for people without much statisticsmaths background the swirl exercises is a very good practical learning tutorial that supplements the course but overall it still lacks on the conceptual aspect personally i have to occasionally refer to other basic statistics materials to be able to follow the flow and understand the lecturesfor the course project there is a huge discrepancy in what the project expect the students to perform and the peer grading criteria as a basic statistic course the correctness of the estimation calculation assumptions is integral in any analysis but the grading criteria mostly neglect all this aspect hopefully the course admin can rectify this aspect of the course	2
poorly executed constant differences in data tiresome to watch two supposedly very intelligent instructors amuse themselves by saying bro and dude the use og graphlab is unnecessary and adds a layer of complication which adds no future value to your toolkit probably a lot of better executed machine learning courses out there	1
very essential	1
this module took me on an interesting journey with lots of twists and turns while i love challenges and learning otherwise i wouldnt have taken this course id like to suggest the following mentor to assist students review of codes i found lots of glitches one quiz rather than two cut back on timeframe id like to give more stars but am being generous with  stars	2
very shallow	1
great overview with some implementations of what will be covered through the specialization	4
the lecturers have poor vocabulary and pronunciation and the videos are very repetitive they r repeating the same thing in all the videos	0
the touch on a lot of topics but do not provide nearly enough information to make it worth staying through the course	1
the marking scheme for essays is filth  i was not even informed what the passing mark is before i received my grade all the instructions for assignments are absurdly unclear also the  professor  s english is terrible	0
he has a clear outline but his definitions are not clear and are very vague his thought process is unorganized	1
an excellent introduction to this fascinating new approach to history and everything else	4
hi i took this course as a refresher and found it very helpfulit is well structured and easy to follow clearly communicated through a rich set of exmaples i recommend it for those with an interest in the subject matterfor myself i look forward to starting the advanced module	3
the actual educational value of this course is quite high the score i can offer it in good faith is dragged down by the additional assignments like write you own quiz question and the expectation to review the quiz questions thought up by other students such things in a scientific course are unnecessary and may actually be counterproductive because of the reliance upon other students and their grasp of the material if they are to remain part of this course they really should be treated as supplementary and not required to complete the course it really detracts from the experience for those of us who come here to learn and not to socialize	2
interesting material well presented	3
really good course with challenging assignments however the grader has some issues for every assignment i had to spend more time trying to figure out how to make the grader accept my answers than actually solving the problems	3
the only interesting part was dplyr the rest was too confusing with lots of lists and no explanations	1
this course presented some valuable insight into what the public are urged to believe on this controversial epidemic	2
absolutely not apropriate for very beginners lacks explanation of why through all the videos simply giving you information to remember if you do this this will happen such a structure of explanations doesnt give freedom in the future to do something different as you dont get a general understanding of what you doadditionally all course is tought in mac some commands are different for windows and they were not even mentioned in the videos i did not sign up for this course to be forced to spend hours in google trying to find how to do something that supposed to be explained in the lessonoverall the course absolutely lacks attention to windows users and is not appropriate for absolute beginners	1
the best course i took so far the presenter is great thanks	4
this course is great instructor is good however the material of this course is not well organized even the swirl practice is not put in the correct week not in the same pace as the lectures the quiz and project are far much easier than lecture content	2
by far to expansive for what you get anyway thanks for the hint about swirl	0
the material was interesting but it lacked in sufficient practice resources for the mathematical portions also instructor support  feedback to student questions was lacking i found this course adequate if it was free but not worth  for the amount of resources i was given to practice what we learned this is highlighted by the fact that the weekly quizzes didnt show you the solution when you missed a question so you were left guessing instructors dont respond to student discussion questions if the videos didnt address that specific question type	1
after  of the work completed i have to admit that this course is not good the instructor is not actually the professor himself and they do lots of mistakes in the videos you do not learn anything that helpful and perhaps the actual swift documentation is way more clearer than this course is	0
i liked the assignments and the creative ideas discussed in the class however i wish there had been more practical stepbystep instruction in approaching design work game artists of more diverse styles and some discussion of game character design as a career	2
great great teacher i am so inspired by her	4
exciting course 	4
bad videos reading material should be summarised	0
it gives some good birds eye view of the topic but i would like to see more indepth and technical material	2
the subject matter is good but the course does not adequately explain behavioral finance concepts most of the course consists of slide decks to read there is a dearth of video content i expected better quality from a course provided through duke university	1
was expecting soo much more from the entire courses not a single practical part soo much talk and writesorry would not share the course with friends  is too much for what i have just learned	0
the tests are difficult	0
thank you	4
thanks	2
there was interesting information in the class but the peer review questions were not well developed to stimulate thought and new ideas many of the answers i read were just repetitions of what was learned in class i think the objectives and expectations could have been more clearly communicated and the statement themselves better thought out i also did not find the peer review process to be that productive as a grading tool the parameters for grading were extremely simple and the feed back was quite subjective from students that did not understand the assignmentswhile i learned some useful information i wont continue with this course	2
it is somehow just an extension on r programming course with many unnecessary details that will be forgotten in a few days after the course	1
this is more of an introduction to statistics lesson than one in excel not what i had signed up for	0
this course is awesome and useful for someone who are intermediate and beginner in imp 	3
simple but good class	4
highly recommdended for those who want to build an endtoend view of project finance despite being a beginner from an engineering background the course structure is engaging and smooth to follow on the concepts invovled in project finance	4
i signed up to learn how to write good code but i dont feel like i learned much i passed the exam by writing an html document that was syntactically and semantically correct but i dont know why it was more correct than what ive been doing on my own and cannot be sure ill will write better code in the future as a result i did learn a lot about the internet in general though i feel like i would have learned more and paid less money taking a course somewhere else or buying a book	1
very concise and to the point just the type of introduction to pe that i was looking for	4
this course is amazing very helpful and interesting	4
first noticeable thing is that the instructor doesnt convey competence very well he lacks the practical examples to explain the principles more efficiently the result for me was that although he chose not to go deep the principles werent as clear memorable or relevant as i think they could have beeni did learn a few useful things of course but it was a disappointment in general	1
this course failed greatly to balance the workload by week the third week which i think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier another proof of week  issue the related swirl exercises start in week  of them and finish in week  more exercises i think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learnerstudent to do more searchexercises on the subject	1
the probability section could use more practical examples i found it difficult to follow	2
not that interesting	2
much of the assignment was out of date the content was not related to big portion of the assignment there was no way of getting clarification over the outdated assignment content	0
i was not impressed and not impressed with this automatically centered text box either there was far too much very technical detail that no one save those working for hedge fund developers would ever use the volume of analysis they suggest is overwhelming and impossible for the average investor and when all is said and done worthless the market moves on news rumors scandal etc think enron worldcom texaco et al none of the concepts presented in this course would have prevented you from investing in those companies when they were beginning or in their primeim about to become a registered investment advisor i took this course looking for ideas to improve my recommendations no go this was terriblein addition the presentation was presented by automatons i think they rarely looked at us they read flatly from the prompter a good text to speech program could easily have replaced the teachers	0
superficial and not well presented	0
amazing class the best class that i have ever seen	4
this course is rather superficial it sadly did not provide practical tips that go beyond common sense	1
the selection of topics is great however the course is too abstract i think some of the materials deserve to be discussed more comprehensively	2
interesting information but too many long lectures that were very repetitive	1
this is the best course of this specialization dr nguyen describes and teaches the contents of machine learning with clarity and digested knowledgei would suggest to add more indepth contents to each of the machine learning category especially clustering classification and association at least as optional contents in case the number of weeks allocated for course are restricted	4
dr boyd is very engaging and his graphics are helpful to guide you along i also love the variety of guest speakers that appear in his class	3
excellent intro course with  semichallenging and fun projects	3
i understand peer review is a bit difficult but being quiz only made this course a bit too easy colleen is a great teacher though and i like her unique teaching style and viewpoint	2
it is a nice introduction but the material is barely worth a one week orientation lesson i have completed it in about  hours with watching all the videos taking detailed notes and completing the quizzes for   why should we pay for a specialization preview we can read info about the separate courses on our own i am really looking forward the next courses in the specialization since i really need a good course in statistics and this seems to be one but the first course should be eliminated the installation of r and github account videos should be added to the next course as an introduction	1
too easy not enough practical skills or tools teaching	2
excelent lots of information and really interesting interviews plus aric rindfleisch is extremely clear in the lectures congratulations	4
its a good course with quite a bit for a newbie to learn would have appreciated more indepth examples in the lectures though as i often found a gap in the lectures and the questions asked in the quiz even otherwise good stuff	2
basic introduction	3
course teaches python pandas in a very practical way and im sure now having learnt it ill use the skill but this course wasnt taught well weekly assignments asked questions about skills that had not been taught yet the course coordinators didnt respond or help in the forums the topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion all the above basically means that passing the weekly assignments takes longer than you may assume had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignments would less frustrating and time consumingbasically the course is good but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitored by staff	1
excellent course highly recommendedthe mathematical notations are sometimes confusing	3
solid course with a good introduction to unity	3
i do really disappointed because when professor starts the third  th week he was only throwing the information without enough explanation so i had to read more about the topics to pass the quiz 	1
theres no point in auditing the course since you dont get access to the answers	0
the structure of the lectures is not really effective	0
shame that it was not possible to progress with this course without using graphlab which the creator of this course himself created please see the course as just a training sales promotion for his ml application	0
a great course to advance programming skills in r assignments are sometimes challenging but thats also what makes it interesting and even more fun if you mastered the challenges and reached your goal i highly recommend it	4
this course is a foundation for every course it reduces your study time and makes it easier to learn difficult subjects i enjoyed every part of the course	4
it was really frustrating that the autograder and assignment instructions didnt match this course has been around too long for that big of a mistake the lectures were the redeeming factor they were interesting and presented the subject matter in a concise way	2
thanks	3
really poor course rather than starting from the basics this course picks random information to work with week  was information anybody with a computer knows week  was really good week  and  were completely useless rather than starting from the basics they jump into picture manipulation and encoding dont take this class if you want to learn about coding	0
really interesting course i enjoy the lectures because they are well explained and full of important material i recommended to anyone that have some knowledge or basic knowledge about infrastructure	4
lacking in content the oop portion of the final project was poorly constructed the instructions were unclear and the exercise seemed futile we took a data set and further complicated it by abstracting into various object classes i think a better example could be used since there are already plenty of ways to do the things our objects were tasked with it seemed like a futile exercise i think a different type of real world object should be used perhaps one that is not easily stored in a data frame	1
at first the questions were wrong but i contacted with the professor and he corrected them	2
awful just awful there are dozens of students trying to install pentaho and failing only reason i managed is that i have prior experience with the software there are no tas no help nothing the quiz is a scam designed to force you to shell out even more money of the socalledoptional textbook and the assignments are extremely vague and orders of magnitude beyond the laughable  minutes the instructor suggested they should take my submissions for week  total over  pages  and i work a full time job avoid this class do not reward terrible courses with your cash	0
useful introductioin	3
although the course structure and information is great the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement current structure doesnt make it possible for the learner to determine the speed all the parts are equally important you have to carefully go through hours of instructionseach week and the assignment builds on what you have done before but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations this causes a lot of confusionpeer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work after submitting my work i discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment	2
very painful training the contents reviewed in the material will not make you capable to solve the weekly assignments you will have to learn what you need on your own to me the only value added of this course is that i will receive a proof that i know how to define basic functions in r	0
instructor doesnt seem to be passionate about giving the lecture	0
this course is too much doggy please do not use coursera for advertising your friendscompanies or at least learn how to do it a little more professionally to look really relevant this psychiatric lady also seems to be sexits looking at differences between pictures with a girl and pictures with a boy is really abominable and shows an intentional discrimination and racism it is really shameful	0
the course is really interesting but it need a content review several  roughly   of the links for external contents especially when they are from newspapers are brokenthat considered it was a fascinating journey	2
ill say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization if you have the skills to complete this course then you dont need to take this course if you dont have the skills to complete this course you will not complete this course the course instruction is at  feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will not teach you the skills required to complete the assignmentsi recommend the machine learning course from bills colleagues at university of washington that is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments though still very challenging	1
boring	0
inroduced useful tools to deal with decision making	3
i think the homework exercises are a very good idea butsince the course is very fast paced more exercises are needed	3
very good course and prof specialy guest prof now really i have a tools to write story for children and teenagermy dream i hope that i will succeed in my new experiencethanks for all	3
worst course on coursera	0
videos rather slow and dont keep you focus voice of the professor is rather low key and slow hard to pay attention at times even though there are examples it should be more interactive with other videos rather than links of text	2
simple and easy way to learn english	2
this course needs too much cc knowledge and the test are far too code oriented you have to give textual answers without having enough help for memory calculation	0
first  weeks give very reasonable overview of the subject  topics of linear  polynomial  multivariate regression are covered quite wellweek  is a bit sloppy and adhoc comparing to first  weeks  glms are given poorly	3
hifirst of all i just want to write i have a background in mechanical engineering and i know the working principles of solar cells quite well i just wanted to check out this coursei started this course but i find that it is very difficult to concentrate i tried pinpointing exactly what the problem was and i came up with followingthere is too much talking and not enough going on visually i know you have a person in front of a white screen and a few visual effects such as floating words and diagrams it is just not working for me i have a hard time remembering what you said i can pause and go back again which is always nice but the info still doesnt stick this especially true for the lca part which i dont even think is a difficult concept to graspi think the best courses i have seen online is not particularly rehearsed and it is usually just a guy with a pen running you through some examples to illustrate the working principles afterwards they do an everyday life example i find that these courses always help me a loti am sorry about the  stars but i hope you see it as a room for improvement it is probably a first time for you guys to use an online platform as a media so it will take a couple of iterations to get it righti did like when you illustrated isc and voc in terms and abbreviations more stuff like that possibly also with an electrical diagram etc and som flow analogyif i can propose anything it would be to organize it a bit more like michigan universitys python learning series i think it is quite good and the assignments are also challenging but you learn a lotanyway thanks a lot for the course i hope you will find a way that works	1
i am very happy as i was perusing the course despite the hard time i got while completing it i earned a lot of skills from the course and am lucky that it helped in what i am doing currently because it touched many areas where i needed to apply a course outside now that you did it online it has saved me alot the videos i downloaded for revision purposes thank you so much for that	3
this class information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course the teachers while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon im not sure if they are primarily researchers who arent used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them as someone who was taking this class without that advantage i was quickly lost among all the jargon to the point where i just had to stop im hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background	1
great course covers the basic algorithms and techniques thoroughly great for someone who is just starting in the field of algorithms	4
its a great course but the assignments are kind of annoying	3
it was okay for an introduction to the methods but i would have liked to learn about them in more details ie the course was too short	2
this was a very good course for a down and dirty review of wacc npv irr eva etc the instructor covers the material well and i found that the reading material was a very good compliment to the lectures and helped embed the material for use in the assignments i recommend this course for those looking for a review or an introduction to corporate finance	3
i have mixed feelings about this course on one hand scope is ambitious and getting to attend a course by g hinton is a luxury on the other hand some topics are addressed confusingly eg hopfield nets or without going into much detail but i think the worst of this course and i wish coursera would take care of that is some quizzes being completely broken missing or incorrect data forcing you to go to forums to get the correct questionthere are big gaps of data and no course biography to follow or complete the missing gaps lecture resources when available is just papers on the topic also the course would benefit from better programming exercises as it stands it is just download a program complete a couple of methods fill in the gaps on a quiz	2
verbose wandering instructor takes too long to do too little no value add over a textbook	0
very helpful for newbie to the machine learning	4
great course great assignments great teacher	4
it is not an easy course without some knowledge of matrix calculation and intermediate math but its quite worth to learn whats the machine learning is	4
not a simple class	2
this is a great code for learning python it doesnt matter if you are a totally beginner or an experienced programmer i recommend it	4
im sorry to say this is a poor course the audio is bad the sound editing is bad the videos are mainly static slides that sometimes arent even showing what the audio is talking about there are no worked examples or annotated slides as an example theres no discussion of the difference between wordpressorg and wordpresscom the only time that is mentioned is when they touch on plugins where they say you cant use them if you started with wordpresscom the additional lectures by guest website designers were the most interesting part but they were supposed to be after the final project i just gave up after less than an hour and went and played with wordpress myself created a website in  days but with no help from this course	0
it covers theoretical part of what big data is and basic info about hadoop quality of presentation slides is below average most of them are not readable  many fonts many colors some with complicated pictures some with no information at all part with map reduce is just slightly touched not explained in details without examples practical tasks from hadoop are very easy and they show nothing just how to navigate over hadoop file system	1
subject matter is excellent but i feel that the course material had too many trick question for a beginner also the lectures would have been more absorbing if they were not just slides with a wall of already inputted code ie a live recording of the coding would have been more informative like what is done in most other courses	2
the lectures were insightful and concise a few topics were a bit too technical like the one on thermo chemical conversion may be more time could have been dedicated to governance issues and strategic planning for swm	3
i went in this course with high expectations after i watched all of the videos for the first week and saw the hilarious homework i quickly checked what this is aboutless than  hours of videos not to mention paying you will be better off with extra credits	0
great course and teacher	4
very education but short id love to see more thank you for the recipes in week 	3
its globally a nice course although you have to keep in mind that it is more like an introduction to the topic rather than a real full course i was quite frustrated from time to time that some important and difficult points are not really justified or explained in details but just given as assumption or obvious concept if you are familiar with that concept you will be fine but probably wont learn that much while if you are not you will be probably lost i mean for a free course this is already a pretty nice job and i think it is worth to take this course i would be for sure ready to pay something to get a longer and more detailed course on this topic	2
this course seems weirdly balanced between assuming one knows very little about statistics while also assuming one is intimately familiar with statistics notation and terminology it would probably be better if the data science track had an optional intro to statistics class that can take more time to let students familiarize themselves with the terminology and then a separate ins and outs of probability testing in r for those already familiar this course seems to try and bite off more than it can chew by attempting to be both at the same timestill the lectures are interesting and the material is important to learn  cover	1
this is a great introduction in machine learning it covers many aspect with a very logical progression in difficulty and easy to follow require some algebra knowledge but there is some introduction in the course	3
the course content is thorough and meticulous one of the best course ive pursued	3
the contents of ppts are just read out in the video lectures its as good as providing only the ppts	0
i had really high expectations from the course i believe but it wasnt upto the mark all it went through was some basic though i would have expected to go in details esp for aperture shutter and dofi am not sure if that i going to be covered in next unit but having gone though the basics in st unit that was expectation in nd unit	1
please be advised that this course is not structured as a rigorous close reading but a general invitation into some central sentiments of the book of zhuangzi perhaps not the kind of course you are looking for in replacement of a serious collegelevel class that surveys the book	0
stepbystep clear explanations	4
very interesting but not practical	2
useful and easily understandable course i am glad i finished it	4
i think this would be a very good introduction to anyone starting to learn to program in a new language  having experience in other languages meant that i was able to skip most of the lectures and complete the quizzesassignment with a python cheat sheet hopefully still a useful background for learning more indepth python featureslectures were interesting and wellstructured	3
basic stuffgood choice of subjectsa little too short	2
the course is essentially just a review of formulas with very little intuition explained to the beginner it was necessary to use a collection of outside material from other courses and readings to learn the concepts this course needs to be completely redone with a focus on developing a students intuition for the material and then support this intuition with basic examples that build as the course progresses a fundamental demonstration of how to use r to work through regression models starting from square one should be added so that this becomes a selfcontained course as it currently stands it is a collection of poorly integrated slides and concepts that serve to confuse the student more than educate other classes teach this material infinitely better	0
the course provides a good description of the different types of machine learning algorithms yet it doesnt include how to apply these in real assignments and includes very little the combinations of different disciplines like computer vision nlp and data science this makes it very difficult to parse the content and think about how to create applied applications	2
positive readings and references allow for an additional study of related course conceptsnegative course is excessively short  both in number of modules and also in resources per module quizzes are excessively easy this course is basically a small part of a previous course in international marketing in asia i think a new set of courses should have been presented and not this some of the concepts are excessively focused in asia also the lg interview videos seem excessivelly of free publicity it should be avoidedoverall  in my opinion to be relevant in the online you have to upscale your game yonsei presents very short courses as it can be seen in the specialization emerging technologies hope you can change your approach in the future or i dont think your courses will have traction please review your next courses in the specialization not to be parts of your previous course but to have new materials i dont think is very credible to slice a course and offering it in  parts and call it a specialzationi wish you luck	1
im torn about this course the instructors approach and enthusiasm are great and the content seems fine but with no direct access to the instructor interactions come from discussion forums and peer reviewed assignments the discussion forums were lifeless with virtually no staff participation throughout the week course there was one discussion thread with staff participation legitimate questions from students about content errors or technical problems went unacknowledged peer review is an understandable part of this course but it has limited utility as the only feedback mechanism in a course populated by beginnersthis course is still quite new i believe it can and will be much better if the pool of students grows and there is more staff participation its still a worthwhile course as is but a tougher sell than earlier courses in this sequence	2
too basic and too focused on farmers market thinking	0
although the course covers interesting subject areas i feel like the various topics should have been explored to a greater depth i understand that someone with lesser background in the relevant areas might not agree with me but overall i felt slightly underwhelmed by the coursealso the skeleton of code provided for the assignments had minor errors and the instructions for assignments were sometimes ambiguous or even incorrect as compared to what was actually required of the code but these minor issues will most likely get resolved in subsequent offerings of the course	2
the class isnt over but im suffering through it not enjoying it like i did the dino uof a classes problems the presenter is horrible hes singsongy trying to be interesting cant you get the dino guy or me ill do it for free painful also  you need more graphics charging along with mr boring and a map of alaska behind him as concept after concept  difficult ones for folks who arent like me with lots of background  is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing yes i noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the sun at an angle around the sun graphic but who cares its something and yes i know its free and i know you have budgets but  universities cant rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship the content is probably better than my perception  and im perceiving high  because i need an aspirin after  minutes of mr please get a professional presenter or at least competent i create online education that is nothing better than powerpoint and a talking head lack of budget but at least the head doesnt make people want to drown themselves in a melting glacier	1
i had much more expectations from this course but this was just a brief overview of contentnot covering all topics of what actual international business should berather than just wasting time like this they should have been crisp and short but actually this professor was good at giving examples	1
inconsistent course content presenters hop between topics complete lack of definitions absense of content structure moreover the presentation style is very boring one thing is for sure  avoid attending finance at university of geneva by all costs	0
i found this course interesting but in this you need to explain more clearly	3
this craft of plot classtaught by mr skyhorsecovers the abdce method the  point checklist etc stories written in this class must have dialogue at least ten points of rising action and must begin with an action sequence no this is not an organic story writing method this class teaches students how to use formulaic writing to artificially engineer stories efficiently and effectively i was very disappointed with this class i enjoy reading literary fiction especially stories in the new yorker so it is no surprise that i was appalled by mr skyhorses strong focus on and praise of the harry potter book series if you plan on writing formulaic genre fiction then perhaps this class is for you even though i disliked the class i must admit it was well taught hence the  star review	3
the instructors overly explain simple concepts and talk about programming inbetween makes the course confusing then you get lost and quiz you on stuff that was not properly explaiuned	0
discussed some stuff ive wondered about for several decades thanks so much	4
very highlever i would have enjoyed more technique to understand art	2
as a softwareengineer and freelancer in the technical software domain for me this course actually had all the meat so far while the first courses in the specialization felt like they didnt take that much effort to pass	4
make the other ones free	0
the pronunciation of the lector was more than awful his english is quite unsuitable for video lectures it was just a torture listening to him	1
the lectures were somehow chaotic	2
perfect really interesting i think this course is changing my way of studying and thinking very motivating moreover i dont have a very good level of english but even without italian subtitles all the videos were very clear thank you	4
perfect teacher teaching and very useful information highly recommended	4
did not learn that much through that course	2
great teaching very usefull	4
some of the contents just seem overly complex especially the videos if they would do a few problems similar to those in the quizzes it would be much more better	2
very basic stuff assignments can be done only in the paid version but as its so basic and everything is peer graded for me the course isnt worth the money compared to other paid language learning classes online or inperson	1
very good and informative lectures but the quizzes were not well designed	3
wonderful coursei took it just to satisfy my curiosity i really enjoyed listening to the lectures and doing the quizzes many thanks to the professor for taking the time to make iti would be happy to see a more advanced version	4
great first part with clear and vivid explanations later in the course a little too many referrals to the book	3
poorly designed and explained you do not really gain much knowledge from this coursei would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course there are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices	0
this course and material does not articulate the google cloud platform offerings maybe google does not want to compete with microsoft azure and aws alike if google itself has approved this google cloud platform trainings on coursera then vola i am out i am way better off supporting aws and azure at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited	0
in my opinion this course is really useful for the people that have an extreme interest with astronomy and also the curious people want to exlore the masive universe and im one of these people in addition im really happy when i found out this website while i was surfing my newfeed thank to this program its really lightful for a lot of questions always be held in my mind but know i have lighted up a lot	4
i find the information provided here to be very spoton clear and transparent innovative and interesting yet i would have loved it if it were the professor of the course the one who checked and graded our assignments as there would be less chances that ged be biast anyways i understand the whole idea and the fact that one cannot check all the assignments submitted in here as there are maybe thousands of them in conclusion i found it very interesting and challenging therefore i am about to begin course no  from this digital marketing specialisation course thanks and cheers	3
it started really well with the deduction and induction  however in the later part of the series the explanation and examples were very light and process of creating new models could have been detailed more	1
good course sometimes too easy but go to start	3
great course loving the energy so far	4
this courses is a great course to start learning and mastering r one drawbacks there are so many open source that contain the solutions to the assignments and people who want a certificate can easily get it without understand everything but if you think a while what can they do with that certificate	4
pretty weak teaching  maybe you can place objects in this order or maybe in this order no any clear logics	2
great introduction to the world of raspberry pi and how to star your iot projects	4
i really enjoyed this course	3
great course  it was very helpful 	4
good course	2
needs to be updated also correct some errors	2
while i am aware that this is an overview of the other courses in the specialization i felt that the quizzes and programming exercises didnt really get into the actual topic for example the recommender systems quiz and programming assignment have nothing about factorization except a single superficial question the material is clear and the overview is nice but the practical part let me down	2
i mean its replicated in the next classes and it has silly questions in the practice quizzes its not worth it just kill this	1
the course appears unfinished and very disorganized the lectures are monotonous and boring	0
unfortunately its very poor material and lecturer is not expirienced yet enough 	1
some profs are very good some are terrible the terrible ones need to improve their teaching skills and even language skills as a native chinese speaker i find some of the lectures very boringgood lectures are clear concise and right to the pointgood teachers make the learning experience effortless and fun poor teachers make it like a torture	1
very good course you can review calculus	3
this was great for em a person whos just in need of learning new things this is great besides theres no limit of certifications that you can have but i still dont think these videos cover everything covered in a professional university	3
very good course to start in the world of web development i loved the part where you talk to the customer and note the requirements that will have the site first time i see a course is taken	4
csev is the best	4
very good theoretical explaination but more practical exercises would have been welcome	3
not very applicable for the real world recursion over lists can be a nice mind exercise but please dont use it in real world there are way too many stack overflows unneeded context switches and cryptic code already dont add to it	1
excellent but a little bit intense and highrequired course like it	4
very basic tricky quiz questions there seems to be multiple right answers	1
very well structured i would recommend it to everyone who are interested in web development	4
it was a good course the quizzes should be corrected since some questions are ambiguous	2
i do not like the different language i do not read fast enough to keep up and understand what is bing said i think we should have a language button to translate to english or any other language that takes cources from corsera	0
the course is excellent the platform has some aspects not so good  some parts still dont show up as done so the progress line is always wrong also the platform is not structured for a course consisting of a number of courses in series leaving the dates etc wrong chapter  and  should ideally show up as completed as theey are repeated in every module which is fine but the platform should take care of those members who have done these in a previous module	3
a really great course	3
if youre currently working in a leadership role this course provides some thoughtful exercises and content you can apply to your day job good content nothing earthshattering but a good presentation of the issues	3
quite advanced in contrast to the rest of this specialization	2
there were some real technical problems in this course the video sound wouldnt match up in places and the brief questions inserted into the video would come prior to us learning the content to answer the question in addition the quiz answers would not match up to what was learned in the video for example one quiz asked what type of question would tell me about a time be and in the video it literally said it was a behavioral question but that was marked wrong in the quiz there were also several instances where the percentages taught to us were marked wrong in the quiz this was not as high of a quality learning experience as the first course in the specialization so i was quite disappointed i do hope someone will go through this course and fix the inconsistencies and technical errors thank you	1
great course as a first approach to game dev im taking the full specialization and so far im having a lot of fun totally recommended	4
course contents are very short and to the point i thought weeks on gaussian model learning and robot mapping were neat but the other two weeks on kalman filter and particle localization were little disappointing they could have discussed both these topics properly by investing more time couple of assignments are tough and there will be very little help to complete it but nevertheless it will keep you interested in the course	2
a tough score which i have mixed feelings about as there was good stuff in here too the course material is interesting and moves at a robust pace and i do think they have made an effort despite the fact that much of it appears lifted from one phd students dissertation realistically i would not recommend this course if you dont have a stem bachelors degree and you will likely find it painful if you have been away from your degree more than three years none of this is bad although the material would have benefitted by being spread out by perhaps two more weeks as realistically people who have been in the workplace a long time may need more time and have less time per week with family commitments unfortunately there are a number of areas that need work  inconsistencies and errors in the material certain unexplained suffixes in equations and worse changes in the suffixes without indication that they changed or what they are i dont feel that this was particularly widespread but it did result in some loss of confidence in the course and time being wasted interpreting  tests throughout the course that often provide the relatively limited feedback of correct well done or worse im sorry to say the relatively useless feedback sorry that is not correct without any explanation of why it was correct or more importantly what an incorrect answer should have been and why i can understand that this will hopefully drive students should do more research but if they hit a wall realistically theyre going to keep iterating on the answers until you pass and learn nothing because of the time pressure to complete by the end of the week i wonder if there is a better mechanism that can be used here  ta support  the lack of ta support coupled with some concern about a history of errors led the students to believe that there was an error in week  for  days students went back and forth debating which one of the two equations that were supposedly doing the same thing but with missing terms were correct not once did a ta wake up and step in in the end one of the students flagged the video as inappropriate to wake the upenn organization up the ta then stepped in and said i paraphrase oh we just dropped those terms because theyre not so important but we didnt mention that if you are not going to adequately support the students the material had better be bulletproof and show some linear thinking  the last exam keep in mind if you do this course you had better be comfortable with calculus linear algebra vector mathmechanics and it would be helpful to have a head start in matlab that said the last question in the last exam was an order of magnitude more challenging than everything else set and almost felt like a shake out question i passed the course and had a good understanding of the material but i suspect that the folks that did made it through that last question in multiple random fashions the material itself is relatively academic and the trajectory topic was definitely so unfortunately the one example jerk trajectory provided appears to have left a lot of students feeling very unsupported based on feedback i saw and would probably benefit from having an example more fully worked through as for the final exam it would be highly desirable for upenn to provide insight into how they would have solved the last part of the last question as my concern is that there is a whole contingent of people who did this course who didnt come away with as good a grounding on trajectories as they may believe they have	1
too much technical i would have preferred high level generic concepts also the exercises were quite tricky for a beginner	0
professor needs to emphasize on basics before going advance	0
it could be a bit more challenging than just running scripts	1
very informative	4
excellent course with excellent content the professor had excellent clarity on the subject and her explanations were very clear	4
good quick overview could have more actual r examples in lectures	2
excellentread the book with the lecturesinspirational thought provoking informative challengingenjoy jeremy k	4
the videos are too short without enough information about the topics you have to read a lot actually this course doesnt look like as others courseras courses and i dont recommend it	0
this course is extremely hard to follow not because of the content but because of the delivery presentation visuals word choice speed all very poor im in week  and every video has been just as difficult to followquizzes are hard to understand and ask you about things that werent of any actual value to the course andor werent even covered also because multiple answers are required for each question you are basically answering a  part question that is only worth  point get one part wrong and you miss the whole  point	0
great course	4
enjoyed every bit of it definitely a flow maker enjoying and flaunting my verified certificate 	4
fun making some apps and presentations in the context of data science	4
this introductory course was helpful in helping me to learn how to write emails in a professional setting tips were very practical	4
wonderful course and equally wonderful instructor i really like how scott builds up from a very simple model and by explaining the intuition behind how we got the math explains the maths	4
excelentevery well explained im a molecular biologist seeking for some programming skills and understanding of the basics of the everydays tools ive found some caveats in the coding problems from stepik but i understand thats difficult to give complete and exact explanations to everyone and every programming language that someone can use besides that everythings perfect and recommended	4
excellent lectures good tests too many peer evaluations	0
i like the course it is very informative and all those skills are simple and easy and these things can be able to cope up by those who are in need of help	3
instead of these classes spiritual classes will be good 	0
more interactive and dynamic videos would be bett	2
very good course if you are looking for a overview of tools in data science specialization	4
unnecessary course for this kind of specialization	1
too long too academic not practical	1
unfortunately this project is not fully aligned with all the previous program which is a shame ideally the project was more related to quantitative data or have compulsory module npl it was certainly a very important learning but very stressful to have to grasp npl and do the project in a short timelearning npl in short time in a diy way without any help it was very negative and stressful	1
first two weeks of the course were ok but after that it became something like javascript claptrap oriented to playing with images i wanted to know how to make webpages i didnt get that information from this course	1
this course gives a really good guide on how to define data science questions correctly and how to work with sharp goals during the hole data analysis funnel from the definition of the data science question to the communication of its results	4
thank you this is course good	3
great course very insightful	4
that course is quite good to get the fundamental knowledge about power electronics	2
not meant for a complete beginner ive spoken to a dozen people who have taken this course and if you dont have some programming skills youll struggle im not suggesting its not doable for the complete beginner but the time commitment may be prohibitive	1
a list of research papers to read further thats it the course is too short to cover the subject so it covers nothing in the endthe programming assignment have no help whatsoever its do it any language the  programming assignment doesnt have much to do with the course we dont even talk about the algo to use to do it it looks like coursera has asked the professor to add a programming assignment to the course and he had  minutes to choose what it could beit shouldnt be advertised in coursera as it isah forgot to mention that no one replies to the forumsactually no one uses themi think the subject is very interesting but this course gives a really bad advertising to coursera the university and the professorit needs more work before its deployed on the platformi am going to try another coursera course in the same kind of subject i hope it wont be the same	0
didnt learn anything in this one	0
a clear and systematic study of project management basics	4
very nice introduction to the topic i wish it had more meat and more exercises to develop the skills presented during the class	1
prosgreat explanations by the instructor easy to understand course with real world examplesconspacing was too slowtoo simple and easy for the  weeks of coursework in my opinion several harder concepts could be covered in the time that the course ran problems were also very simple and not very challenging	2
the course is fantastic even though you have never heard about programming the professor is awesome and really clear in his explanations it seems to me like a real time lecture whatever is my question he answers it on the very next minute 	4
the new platform sucksthe people who just want to learn for free and not purchase a certificate are barred from attempting the quizzes unlike the old platform not being able to take the quizzes completely ruins the learning experience	0
sample to learnvery good	4
good overview of agile practicesif youre doing the specialization they say you can take courses    in any order technically thats true but my recommendation is to do them in orderthey refer to course  in course  and the difficulty of assignments decreases if you do them in opposite order like i did	3
i would not recommend this course the content is very relevant to the subject matter however the lectures are much longer than they need to be and filled with unnecessary commentary the instructor often verbally discusses the statistical formula with a few bullets on a slide with the focus on himself the delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walkthrough of the equation at hand	1
will be better again if we can have a return from the pedagogic team on the differents achievement donemerry christmas and hny	4
it wasnt exactly what id expected but was still a good course	2
good course well structured just needs some technical improvements in order to be able to review wrong  right answers in quizzesnice to have a second more advanced course in this topicjoaquín	3
great course	4
excellent course really enjoyed learning the planning stages of a new project	4
not so helpful this generation already is familiar with everything taught here withdrawing the honor code certification is so unethical not going to take any courses from coursera from now on	0
not professional at all	0
initially i was excited about this course but i lost interest due to two things first while the beginning segments about how we know the presocratics was great the presentation of the early milesians was shallow and did not deepen my understanding of their world and thought then the section on parmenides made me lose faith in the teacher  she presented his main ideas in such a way as to obscure his vision which is of what we now call a multiverse a world in which all things exist potentially the best part of the course was that it made me seek out other writers about parmenides	1
if you are a finace or business student this is not for you its a complete rerun of most of the basics that re taught with some practical real life examples good for a person who is new to the subject of business or finance	2
nlp is a total different thing and should be a course by itself i would prefer a a large scale machine learning capstone where we could make models and it would fit better to real life situation through all the courses i worked hard only to reach nlp capstone this doesnt feel right please fix it	0
the quality of the lecture is poor  slides are dense and full of bullet points which the professor literally just reads out on videos i did a google search and found almost all of the analytical charts he presented readily available on the internet what exactly is the point in the lecture then instead why dont you compress some valuable learning nuggets into half the course time instead of hearing you ready through your ocean of bullet points and needlessly underline in red the current bullet point your reading seriously this is one the poorest quality lectures ive ever donethe quality of peer assignments to grade are a joke classmates are simply copying bits and pieces of the lecture material to make up the market sizing memoi seriously doubt the learning value in this class and the quality of instruction	0
lifelike and easily accessible	4
a fantastic course that truly shows you the methods of effective study backed by scientific research	4
course contents are fineunfortunately the absence of a course board where students can discuss and eventually receive help from the teacher has an bad influence on the course overall rating	2
prof raj teaches the course well	3
i was surprised that we dont suppose to learn about writing scripts because the best way to learn is to write the script it wasnt easy for me as not a native speaker but i finished it i recommend this course jan is the best mentor thank you very much	4
if you do not already know java or at least have some experience with it i would not recommend this class they say all you need to have is very basic computer knowledge sending emails opening a browser but the lectures are taught using acronyms and terms that are not at the beginner level even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners levelthey also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics they discuss them a bit but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts youve learned fit together there is no real consistency throughout the course it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding for a true beginner without any other form of practice before handthe assignments are also a bit of a mess all you are really doing is filling in the blank they give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work but since everything else is written you can not run the code as you write it to check your work it will fail because the code is looking for things you havent written yet you must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works i find this to be a very poor teaching method you should be able to check your work as you go or experiment with different ways of writing things instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect	0
good introduction for people who have no prior programming background	2
this feels more a like a sales pitch for copyblogger than an actual course kinda feels like a waste of my time i didnt learn anything new	0
vey usefull course nice professor	4
i found the course quite useful it was my first but not last step to join the machine learning world courses scope makes me feel now im familiar with lots of concepts of ml research space it was also easily understandable and also not hard to deal with even for some specific lessons that required a bit attentionoverall im happy to take this course as my first step to machine learning and i advise it to everyone who wants to improve himselfherself or start a new career path on ml	4
this course is not very beginner friendly	1
very interesting and handy im spaniard so most of the things are basic for me such as the use of onion and garlic in meals and the use of street market for shopping vegetables but the recipes were fantastic and since im a mother of a yearold child i will put on practice soon thank you	3
too	0
great class learned a lot	4
not very dynamic	0
loving it so far  great lecturers with engaging teaching styles	4
coursera changed the rules on access to graded quizzes in the middle of this specialization the last course in the specialization allowed free access to graded quizzes and homeworkduring this course the free access to quizzes and assignments is no longer an optioneven more annoying is the fact that i also receive email reminding me to complete the quiz which would require me to upgrade to a paid enrollment to allow me to submit assignments to gradingthanks for nothing coursera	0
amazing course touching areas where i also often debated with myself	3
excellent course for first responders and those who just want to know how to react in an emergency	3
clear videoss structure is missing sometimes but great examples	3
its helpful course thanks a lot	4
amazing and very educational	3
very disappointed with how the transition from the old coursera platform to the new platform has been handled lots of instances of the see lecture x in the quizzes where the reference is now just wrong because the lectures got renumbered an almost complete lack of community tamentors and no explanations from anyone as to how the new platform worksperhaps the worst of all has been the almost complete lack of acknowledgement of any problems from the folks at jhu this feels like its just been dumped on the students without any real testing or any appropriate resources to sort out any problems	0
i am glad that this exist but notice many errors every chapter has at least one error wish the admin address these issues through the discussion forums	2
i wish i could rate this course higher but i didnt enjoy it and despite being  weeks into it im going to stop now the videos are hard to follow the examples are few and far in between some explanations eg exchange rates are really poorly explained im disappointed i dont feel like i learned much	1
had fun with ur studies thank youfor helping	3
good for understanding concepts and running code in sas but still needs more depth to the coursework	3
utterly disappointing i hoped for a factbased education on current scientific thinking in nutrition instead this course consists of a couple of peoples opinions on eating without cited evidence presented in a feelgood documentarylite format with good camerawork and cute children this is a high school public service announcement not a university course not what id expect from stanford or coursera	0
they taught nothing	0
the case study approach for explaining machine learning concepts is commendable this kind of approach will not only help in cementing the concepts but helps in making decisions when it comes to reallife applications	4
this course is not very beginner friendly	1
the course is an overview of the principles of management but ts a great introduction to the principles of management	3
it is an excellent course but it would be nice if he talk about complexity of these data structures over all this course is nice for complete beginner in the word of programming	3
loved the course basic explained very well assigments could be more challenging and built in pythonr	3
a very simple and easy to understand course very impactful if you take it seriously and try doing what the instructor explains the articles that were shared were very useful especially while creating a mission statement etc would recommend to those who want to be launch their new self	3
i love charles	4
its amazing course  i really enjoying it right now cause it has a lot of information and help me to realise what is the problem and it gives me tools to solve my problem and the common problem it that way  so thanks for learn how to learn team d	3
i loved doing the course and especially while doing each assignment of writing a story the short guiding videos were to the point and interviews with personalities was engaging thanks for the course	3
good introductory course on finance	3
good course that gets you going with unityd very simple to follow the handson lectures just repeat in your own editor the assignments are very easy this is the easiest course ive completed on coursera very basic coding involved and you dont need to write anything from scratch i will take the next course offered by michigan state university as well	3
this entire series has been fantastic im making a career change right now  going into ux design  and i really believe that i would not have been able to do so without this course given a week to redesign an app to get into a vocational schools career training program i was only able to do so thanks largely in part to the materials found in these lecturessuggestioncould it be made possible to unlock videos ahead of the weekly schedule for people like me who are mostly auditing the course it would be really helpful if one is under time pressure and needs access to material like how to do need finding to be able to jump ahead to that lecturethank you all for making this great course truly this age is nothing short of a new renaissance	4
in comparison to the first course this one lacks a lot of organization and debugging before sending it to the public	2
speak too fast and lack of interaction in the first  modules	2
it was a very good experience to take this course thank you	3
weekly quizzes would be great	2
well doneall about i have to know about mongodb but the assignment are too much time expensive for who have a job like me	3
the class recording could have been made simple lots of notations and would definitely be difficult for people without prior econometrics background	0
this is for people doing social work in third world countries trust me videos discussing open defecation and child marriage get old fast also the stuff about social norms is very confusing and hard to understand	0
very informative but the coding elements can be somewhat difficult mainly because theres not many specific examples provided it is still a very enlightening course ps you definitely need to at the very least be very familiar with differential equations to take this	2
i liked every course in this specialization except	2
good introduction it would be even better with a few more presentation on swift	2
this course is somewhat lacking depth the introduced tools are very basic and i would have expected more content for the prize	1
excellent course i love python i love can programming	4
it is not a bad course but it is very little informative there is some nice general discussions about data science by the teacher there is the explanation of the package knitr and little elseas part of the data science specialization it is nice as a standalone course i would definitely not recommend it	1
theres no way to get help in this course im stuck on one of the quizzes  probably just something easy that ive misread but theres no way to ask questions so theres no way for me to complete the quiz this is very frustrating	0
not well explained previous module was better structured	2
great lesson great course congrats 	4
extremely remedial not worth the time or cost on its own unfortunately its required for the specialization	1
one of the best courses i passed	4
very shallow content  broad but not deep not many assignments instead of the last one we hear what we heard before for the same price analytics edge at edx is far better choice for practical machine learning	1
a decent course perhaps not as interesting as the previous one but definitely very innovative and informative	2
feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful when designing character for video games is also important the skill you have or obtain while doing it and this doesnt place any emphasis into it so for the price the charge in the certificate it really feels like a money grabber rather than teaching anything useful at all other schools like gnomon workshop and dvds like eatd and many others out there which gives e more content for a fraction of the price they charging here it needs to be deeper and more robust if this course wants to stand out right now is not	0
the first week gave me a good insight into the data science process i now understand the situations in which data science can best be applied however i still do not fully understand the statistics aspect it would help me if the instructors would provide examples in detail of supervised vs unsupervised learning i seem to understand the theory behind it but i am not sure how valuable it will be for me	2
thanks for andrew ng that give me a clear slight about machine learning and through this course i gain a well achievement the knowledge taught by professor ng shows a wisdom way to me i think i will inspired much by the content of this course when i design a machine learning system or deep learning systemthank you for your concretely and clearly guidance that makes me insist to learning this course until endyou are the best teacher i have never met before the implicit way that you teach makes me want to be a better man likes you	4
it seems more like a weekend lesson than a well prepared course i mean it looks that it had little preparation and too much improvisation therefore it should be a free ar at least cheaper certificate due the quite poor planning and execution	1
this course is very special it has a formal math development but is clear with very nice exemples	4
explaining each and every steps was good i feel it would have been better if some visual elements in the course material which will us to understand faster than the current teaching practice	3
this course starting from week  in not for beginners at all if you are truly new to programming you would understand nothing from the java script part of the course a lot of people complain about the same issue during the course	0
clear instructions great teacher	4
too much reuse of old material assignments as well as lectures	0
thank you for this course it was interesting and helpful beforebut i failed i got bad mark and i dont know whyi have only one good comment but i have  bad marks and only  good i am a looser i guessso i hate this course this website this review system and this worldthank you again	0
good introduction to the fieldgood presenterspoor illustrations during coursethanks	2
a very lightweight intro to html css javascript jquery and a dash of boostrap the instructors barely introduce the topics and then point out that we dont need them we can just google or yahoo for the informationif you just need a shove to get you moving down a path this might be helpful or if you are brand new to html this would be a relatively painless way to check it out im just not sure there is enough hand holding over the difficult bits for someone brand new to coding the materials are pretty sparse and there is not much structureall four weeks are available at the onset of the class and the entire class can be completed in a weekend	1
this course was very nice its objectives were clear and it gave a good panorama of the writing experience the interviews with writers were interesting and some tips about editing and publishing were really valuable	3
they shouldnt compact  videos in one week	0
not even sure it worth one star all due respect	0
for prospective students who are looking to enter the biostatisticsepidemiology field in the future this course is designed as an in depth fundamentals of biostatistics where professor brain caffo dives deep into some of the key formulas origins of statistical formulas and theoretical aspects of statisticsgreat lecture with valuable information however due to the lack of engagement within the lectures it absolutely leave students who have no background of calculus or linear algebra in the dust with no reference to assist them in the course once or if a student has a solid foundation for the topics covered in this course this information is very insightful and understandableyou might ask yourself someone who doesnt have a prior knowledge of the material covered in the course if you should even take part in the course my answer would still be yes so long as you are willing take notes save the videos and return back to them at a later point once you build yourself up by studying calculus statistics andor linear algebra	2
too basic	1
no much staff in it	1
the lecture course is extremely helpful and insightful thanks to coursera for the series	4
nice understanding and structured course it has strongly deepened my knowledge on health outcomes of chemicals	4
no forum what are you thinking	0
this course is a better option to start with programming and that also with python	2
this covers techniques to harvest data from online sources a common first steps in many projects	4
good course	3
awesome course and the simplicity of demonstrating the concepts is quite good	3
this course is useless and perhaps even harmfulthe professors would have done much better if they had taught the class in their native chinese language and then got a really good translator to make subtitles in englishi tried turning off the sound and just watching the presentation while reading the subtitles but even this was so badly done in terms of language and presentation that although i desperately wanted to take a course in advanced neurobiology i felt that this course could actually destroy my love for the subject or teach me things that are incorrect because of language mistakesif you are not a native speaker of english then by all means steer even further clear as you will learn some very bad english habits and pronunciationim sure the profs english ability is fine for collaborating with other professionals who already know the material but teaching in english was a big mistakeagain i highly suggest they redo the entire thing in chinese and get really good translations and subtitles made and then i think it could be an awesome course now as is it would be truly foolish to take this course	0
the high video production values of this course fail to hide the abysmal lack of content with approximately  mins per week of video charging  for this course is a disgrace potential students should save their money and read the relevant wikipedia pages	0
the material was was too much for the estimated time given to spend on the course per week the assignments are very lengthy and the grading doesnt always conform to what would be intuitivesome gems used in the course material are also old versions there are entries in the db seed data that cause trouble leading to intensive debugging and modification of given files that require a much more experienced programmer to figure out	1
 for this course and they cant even bother to make sure that the quizzes are scored correctly two weeks back to back and one question each week has been counted wrong when answered correctly that paired with the fact that your only method to have an assignment graded is via peer review means that ill be suggesting peers save their money on this course its entirely possible that you could be stranded with no one to grade your work  courseras suggestion if this should occur is that you should beg on the forums  or transfer your work to a later session of the same course good content awful policies intended to allow the platform to be handsoff for coursera  thats unacceptable at this price	0
beware this course especially if you are new to this area despite what the coursespecialization says there are very few examples to clarify and illustrate the different topics of the course but whats worse is that the assignments are almost completely divorced from the instructional videos the assignments and especially the final project are much more complicated than anything presented in the instructional videos so there is no knowledge basis from which the student can operate to complete the assignmentsprojects satisfactorily or smoothlyi am extremely dissatisfied and wish i hadnt paid for this specialization beware	1
a good introduction to data science	2
lessons are very good but the assignments for the later weeks are way too hard for people with no math or programming experience	1
too easy even though i understand its the first course of the series but great professor	1
great course with assignments that really stretch your ability to think about a problem	4
i feel like the topic of technology is important but important enough for a full course i also feel more class management strategies for esl classroom would have been a more valuable topic	2
quality of the video and sound are bad a few minutes after starting a lesson sound goes off or picture holds and moves no more this made me stop the course	0
slow never to the point repetitive presentation and communication outdated this class is a text high schooler students nightmare almost to the point to be an homage to the boring economic class at the beginning of  ferris buellers day off httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuhicfdweqfa	1
muy light	1
lost in details professionalsbtw i hold a msc degree in computer engineering cannot get anything from this what is the point of writing frequencypl where there is a hist function in r if the instructor is trying to teach us how to program in any language then i can assure you the data science class is not the right place i recommend the instructor check essec business school for analytics subject to better comprehend the coursera and its goals	0
this course was a great course eye opener packed with a lot of information for each week one really must spend some quality time to learn everything that the course has to offer a great course from duke and dr david boyd loved every bit of it	4
very informative although its a little bit too theoritical	2
i was very disappointed in this course which held much promise too much of it has to do with the changing of colours i got bogged down by hex colour requirements and other ancillary requirements i did not want to learn such things i wanted to learn the methodologies of programming and how the statements in html css and javascript interact all of these areas were only touched on in very minor ways and with little learned i got more out of the books i borrowed from the library in the same timeframe	1
i found it very basic there were lots of repetition i was expecting something more indepth loved the graphics though	1
incorrect formulas very simplistic approach to subject matter	0
the structure of the class follows the regular academic model youll find in college lecture  lecture  lecture  assignment repeat i dont think this model is suitable for online delivery without discussion and the ability to interrupt and ask questions the lectures are at times a more frustrating than useful especially with courseras user interface which lacks quick rewind and is generally speaking rather poorly thought outfor many of the topics better videos exist online try safari or pluralsight as for the problems they were the main source of learning but were also at times a bit frustrating the splay trees starter code was rather sad to look at i find that hacker rank is probably better at delivering value if you can forego the warm fuzzy feeling you get from getting a verified certificate youll probably be better served by practicing on hacker rank than from doing the problems in this course	2
pretty cool course	2
the content is so good	4
content was fantastic however delivery was quite dull two talking heads and chapters from a helpful but rather dry book the best part was the assignment could be spruced up with some printable versions of the text screens or even better a workbook to use in figuring out how to use this at home	3
course itself is a  star pretty good the service from coursera a one star an assignment was submitted by the deadline but was never reviewed course closed and they say i have to enroll in the next course what a huge pain wont take coursera classes again for certificate	0
no forum  no email  no support whatsoever  very frustrating	0
the lectures are very good but the course administrators forgot to proof read the quizzes evidently some questions have been deleted and the result is complete nonsense the lectures are worth listening to and i did that with some interest but as a course the administrators have failed	0
started in middle of everything its course covers  to  factor samples in the final exam the minimum factors is  or moreyou not will learn r not really business insights but you learn some specific casesi think you will learn lots of betters course in this site	0
very good course thank you 	4
i was most excited about taking this class in fact its how i found the specialization as a whole and i did not get as much out of it as i was hoping for  i think that its geared to too wide of an audience so we didnt get as specific as i was anticipating i also felt that a lot of the time of the videos were taken up by telling us what not to do you dont want to be too far to this side but you dont want to be too far to the other side right i did get some good information out of this class but i found a disconnect between the lectures and the homework when we were assigned an elevator pitch as an assignment it might have been nice to have seen some examples of elevator pitcheswhat makes a good or a bad elevator pitch what kind of things would be a good idea to include concrete examples would have been super helpful submitting my homework and then seeing that other people did vastly different stuff made me question my own submission did we just take it in a different direction or did i or they misunderstand the assignment but since were all peer reviewing its a case of the blind leading the blind there this also happened with the swot documentwhich i dont think was even mentioned in the lectures at all indepth again it would have been helpful to have seen some concrete examples as ive never heard of that document before	1
love the course structure very simple teachers start with simple concepts and eventually solve real life problems which sound very complex otherwise	3
good overview but some of the content is just quickly mentioned and not put into practice give more room to use in examples create action tell stories some of the lecturers were just reading down the notes wer already see in front of us and were not finishing their sentences in an engaging way sometimes they made comments in a very low tone  some of the sounds are not good quality mono  just on one ear	2
very good for starting with this beautiful and powerful interface i really like it	3
very easy to follow and great explanations	3
excellent course professor yu bin is a fantastic teacher  i have learned so much on this course and cant wait to start the next course xiè xie	4
this course increased my thirst of learning in a new field	3
the course uses proprietary tools for machine learning and data manipulation making it effectively useless however the material on describing the machine learning algorithms were excellent	1
the instructors a fantastic comedic duo i had numerous laugh out loud moments while getting a much better handle on machine learning the instruction is clear and the homeworks are always interesting and well thought outi really only have one complaint graphlab graphlab is a fantastic piece of software that makes data science easy i was amazed at how much harder it was for me to complete the home works with scikit and pandas unfortunately its very unlikely that any future employer will be using graphlab its a great intro for noobs like me but its very expensive and can be replicated with open source packages as such i had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out on my own how to perform graph lab operations in the open source world avoiding this kind of slow frustrating stack exchange binging  tab opening nonsense is one of reasons i take moocs in the first place i hope a future version sets up the bones of what open source packages can be used to solve each problem setin summary i really enjoyed this class i was excited to work on it i learned things that made me more productive at work i felt the joy of learning i was disappointed by the insistence on graphlab but if making the sales case for it is what motivated carlos and emily to put the class together its worth the frustration im extremely grateful to both of them for putting this together	3
the best place to learn machine learning the programming exercises were really good and the lectures were very easy and enjoyable	4
course was helpful in giving a structure to think deeply about a difficult nebulous topic as is influence appreciated all the tips and tactics	3
i am running firefox v on ubuntu linux v i was unable to watch any of the lecture videos due to the page reloading every    seconds i tried moving to a different video with the same results i dont know if this is uc davisspecific or whether coursera has changed significantly since the last time i took a class but this course is totally unusablei would have left this review with coursera rather than as a course review but coursera doesnt make contact information easy to locate	0
this was an enjoyable course taught by someone who is obviously not only a superb pianist and musician but also completely in love with beethovens piano music the reason for my star rather than star rating was that i felt the teaching would have benefited from a few visual aids as well as demonstrations at the keyboard as mr biss appeared equally enthusiastic about the music of haydn perhaps we might look forward to exploring haydns piano sonatas in the future	3
good preliminary overview of these aspects of life career and business	3
clear and usefulmore real study cases would have been a plusas the analyses of failures investmentspfi mechanisms and impacts are not integrated thats is missing	3
was good intro to the course	4
a lot of formulas and theory which if attempted by the casual investor would quickly overwhelm him and reduce him to a babbling idiot with no investmentsone useful tip use a  drop in consumer confidence to warn you of an impending recession and sell everything back into equity when the consumer confidence level gets back to its trigger point	1
very interesting subject matter however sadly brought in a boring way resulting in my quitting the course	1
in all its a good course to know some basics but the data and some of the informations are out of date it seems most datas are from late  early  things have changed	2
i found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didnt always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wantedfor a nonspecialist statistics is almost always a struggle intently making it more difficult by trying to use trick questions and application in the quizzes and exam beyond what was covered in the course makes it really really difficult for those of us who are naturals at mathi worked really hard in the course and finally made it thought all  weeks of the course but after one try at the final exam i said to myself enough is enough i hate being a quitter but i was not learning statistics and causing myself many headaches and feelings of inferiority and selfdoubt because i just couldnt match the quiz and exam questions to the material covered in the coursemaybe other people are much smarter than i am but this source was a soul and time killer for me	0
smile on the face of professor is missing otherwise  stars	0
outdated material nightmare to submit assignments badly needs to be updated	0
detailed but slower	3
readings were not necessary for the course and quizzes were extremely difficult seeming to be worded in an attempt to stump students and many questions were not from the course lessons videos very dry and boring	1
while the subject matter was extremely relevant i didnt think this course was taught well much of the lecture and exercise focused on providing direction than actually teaching i felt as though i was just copying and pasting sample code at times it was as though the professor was rushing to introduce new modules rather than discussing how and why certain concepts should be used in most cases i could have learned the ionic modules just as well by reading the documentation and looking at sample code which is often what this course felt like id have much rather seen the concepts explained in more detail than rushing to add new modules without any contextthe quizzes are not challenging the professor always puts the correct answer as the first choice and the exercises just provide cutpaste code snippets without any reasoning or explanation i would have preferred to have the exercises conducted by providing a high level goal and then a solution to check against rather than the put this code here approach thats used the assignment grading is either far too obvious whether a required module was injected or not or completely arbitrary generally the assignments lacked nuance and complexity as well i didnt feel like i really learned any of the concepts behind this material after going through the course	1
the course was hard to follow and understand	1
this course is badly structured with proposed tasks not being well oriented and videos where teachers are constantly doubting and making mistakes not really happy with it	0
very basic introduction to data science seasoned programmer or other it professionals are likely to find this course really weak	1
good general guidance richard sellers was the most useful interesting how even established in a career can be considered a generalist	2
i actually enjoyed this class very much but it doesnt go very deep in the topic the questions to the quiz are very easy to answer to in my opinion this class is great for a general public but it is not an university level course	2
i personally found the course very useful it provides a good overview of some of the most widely used bioinformatic tools nowadays without being too demanding that labs are particularly good and you are able to explore at your own pace but with the necessary guidance i have a background in molecular and cell biology so i found it very easy to follow	4
this course is an overview of string quartet music it provides some nice resources to get to know certain composers or quartets better it helped guide me to some nice music the instructors are knowledgeable and do a good job imparting some of their insight into the lectures the level of detail is about right for my time and attention span	3
a  page reading could have make it not enough material to be consider a course	0
interesting course could have added a bit more on how to write basic scripts or more ways of social media analytics	3
wow that was a waste of my timeso many broken elements mistakes etc last minute rush job putting this course together	0
useful and powerful	4
the course was very nice and useful and the explanations were very goodthe biggest problem of this course was that it required to be purchased in order to unlock the quizzes and the assignments i dont know who decided to do this the organizers of this course or coursera but i dont think it was a good ideai was not interested and i am sure i am not the only one in receiving a certificate i just wanted to learn and to test the acquired knowledgei realize that it is impossible to improve this project without any money but you can obtain the needed money from other sources donations sponsorships without affecting those who want to learn event that the access to the video was not restricted thus many knowledge can still be acquired by those who want the assignments have their important role in the learning processi saw that i am not the only one who mentioned in the feedbacks the purchasing problem for this course i hope that these feedbacks will be taken into account and the things will be changed for the next editions of this courseto sum up the information from this course and the manner of providing this deserves  stars because of the purchasing issue i am giving only one star	0
a great continuation further detail introduce python programming skills when and how to apply	4
the material is extremely fragmented and it seems like that the instructor is just throwing information at you without caring if you are absorbing any of it at all i got a headache and lost my motivation to learn the subject	0
really basic course the second lecturer is disappointing	1
really bad explanation no code explain they left you on your own its supposed to teach you not to left you undestand nothing they just teach components but the real thing the progaming is undeground no one knows that kinda weird 	0
totally enjoyed the course and learnt a lot	3
an ambitious sweep across the nlp landscape requires at least intermediate knowledge of python especially the programming assignments are barely doable without advanced debugging skills exercises often refer to material not covered in the course up to that point	1
it is too basic	0
such a boring class	0
this course is understanding water and sanitation through the lens of economics lacked water and sanitation element through infectious disease biological lens i guess that is why its water supply and sanitation policy	2
so basic tableau explanations	2
meh it was just okay	2
the mathematics in this course are at a high level similar to statistical inference  and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field there is little guidance presented on the methods required it is recommended that students source out plenty of support material intro to statistical inference and similar	1
nice course to get started	4
good course	4
i was unhappy with this it was clear that this course was pulled together from a superset of other material and that it was not checked for consistency or completeness the students were tested on their ability to write down a specific phrase from a video rather than on application of the principles learned from utilization of the graph database tools broccoli  reallyfurther the lack of response to questions posted in the forum indicates a lack of engagement from instructors and  or facilitators	0
sadly i found the presentation poor not at all fluent and underprepared  sometimes what was said was different from what was written which was correct potentially causing confusion also some results were given without justifying them for instance the concept of simplest number was stated but not proper	0
cool	4
a total waste of time  not challenging at all in any aspect it was quite funny that many word problems were identical with only some parameters changing  buckeyes please try harder next time 	0
the material is very unclear	0
too much synthetic on very important parts too much focused on graphlab	2
i found this a very informative course on the recent developments and the basics of the ev field	4
is this a real course for a data scientist just installing shit and a peer reviewing for that screenshot and forking all repos very bad not worth to be with rest course in specialization	0
interesting concept and great insight into the workings of a research project yet limited in scope effectively the long term effects cannot be proven on evidence and the practical feasability of the ideal seems to be rather limited i would love to eat more deer though	2
nice course but the peer assignment is awful	1
its a good way to start in code but its just for a program well still being a good course funny and you can learn a lot  thanks	3
the course content applies to r the teachers focused on the programming language rather than the application of the existing graphs to explore data	2
not as detailed or practical as i hoped for	1
this course is a must for anyone who wants to learn two thumbs up	4
i would not take this class as a stand alone course but am excited about what it may be setting up for the classes to follow the instruction in this course was pretty basic and not difficult in the least	3
great course one sugestão i have is to teaching how to use fileresourceurlresource directoryresource pixel imageresource etc without using the eduduke because in the real word we dont use this library i know this library can facilitate the coding but when the students use another ide they will not can do the same coding as they used on course	3
awesome and i really enjoy this course	4
some quiz have some bad wording which make it hard to understand	3
it has helped me to view business in a new way	3
very informative but very dry presentations	1
great learning experience	4
its very good	4
great course to refresh my knowledge and update some concepts	3
the course lacks deep theoretical understanding of the concepts	2
lovely love the ideas and great mentors	3
this course lacks projects to implement the skills we learn	1
slow down introduce more r before asking to create projects in r only because i know other programming language was i able to finish week  also very strong group of mentors god bless you mentorsdisconnect between course objectives and programming assignments  labs reading book you learn one thing watching lectures another and then unrelated labs which then culminate in something totally different during week 	2
this course should have been very good lots of detail but the material is not presented very clearly the assignments are also not setup so that it is easy to fix your work it either passes or you get minimal feedback	1
so much useful information thanks	4
excellent introduction to rpi	4
actually the course should be titled as introduction into macroeconomics i think the course is fine but i wont call it really advanced one the structure and topic list is okay but the depth is not enough to threat the course as advanced	2
makes it very confusing i was looking to make a business websites	0
you should rename it to s style history of comunication from bell to nowdays with useless facts about iti watched almost all first block but then i understood that i learnt nothing than i tried the iot block but it still wordy and superficial use more media to show your main ideas take a class of public speaking and stop shaking a remote all the time you dont even use it	0
this is a very basic course and should state that in the description	1
the last homework si quite a difficult spike way too complicated for beginners	0
a great course it took me out of my comfort zone of design ideas	4
we are getting basic ideas but going through all the information structuring the ideas too quickly with no examples  limited examples which is what will teach us the most then we get to the quiz with questions where we have to apply real life examples to the structured learning and its very difficult instead too much time spent on videos of role playing  just spend time giving proper examples we can learn from instead of blasting through them furthermore the professor is difficult to understand a lot of the timethe visuals are the best part of the course	1
there is absolutely no supervision on this course my essay has been sitting in a student review cue for two months now  so no completion of course and the program has the audacity to mark me as late submission i have reviewed  papers requirement of  and am shown as being deficient it is as if i dropped into a voidi paid a decent amount of money to attend this course and very disappointed that it is simply run on auto pilot with no place to go for resolution questions or helpi would not recommend taking this course and would better advise you to find something in another online teaching program or course within coursera that has at least a modicum of personal interaction	1
first of all the instructor is very responsible keep updating information on the forum and course material the course is a decent level of basic plotting technique review should be in more detail compared with the first course of this specialization this second course is much less challenging require less effort to accomplish the first course is the one attract me of this specialization the second one somehow is a bit disappointing especially compared with plotting skill of r in another data science specialization which is even an elementary level course this course cannot be labeled as intermediate levelanother problem with this course is the peer review the grading policy should be changed to punish irresponsible reviewers no useful feedback got what kind of responsible one provide feedback in two words where require to answer three questions week  assignment to review	2
if you have some basic knowledge about food and nutrition then this course is not the right for you its very basic and sometimes trivial but the lecturer and course itself was really nice	2
terrible course i the lecturer seems to be all over the place briefly touching on several aspects of finance in a superficial way without much coherence with respect to each weeks theme ii the lecturer speaks in a very confusing way without formulating clear sentences and often divagating from the main topic with minor details that are neither necessarily relevant nor properly explained iii the few formulas that the lecturer presents are treated as if they have fallen from the sky en bloc without explaining bit by bit how they are obtained iv the main points of each lecture are not stressed sufficiently enough leaving one to wonder what the takehome messages are at the end of each lecturei give the course one star due to the appreciated emphasis that the lecturer places on unorthodox economic approaches such as behavioural economics and on the important issue of finance democratisation	0
simply awesome great teacher y	4
good course	4
this course is a disappointment after the previous two courses in the specialisation it tries to cover too many topics as a result it provides a shallow introduction to many topics rather than deep coverage of any one topic i do not feel i have learnt anything of substancemany of the assignment questions are poorly written to name one example assignment  question  has at least three correct answers but the grader accepts only one of them i wasted hours trying to work out why it was marking my answer wrongthe lectures by the tas are delivered in a robotic tone if youll pardon the pun they are reading off an autocue and it shows	1
poor quality videos make the course less appealing and make it seems to be unprofessional	0
i am a developer and know how to create advanced websites this course has less use for me as in my day job i create sophisticated websites	1
well doneit was my first mooc in chinese content was interesting and example were useful i liked the exemples with the dow jonesas i tried to follow using python  i had difficulties with gui compatibility and some evolution in scipy	3
it does not touch hash table or stack just the common data type in python	0
very good course material however graphlab is no longer free to use for commercial purpose	1
this course took me  weeks longer than anticipated and im not sure it was the difficulty of the material a lot of this information is review for me so i am confused why it took so much time to complete there were new topics and i did enjoy working through the homework questions	3
although i have passion with film the quizzes seems to have lots of technical problems i dropped out right on the first module	0
i have adored this course the content and mr wrights approach his enthusiasm and knowledge of classical music shine throughout the course he has made classical music far more approachable for those less in tunethank you for the wonderful course mr wright	4
basically a couple of guys have an unorganized discussion about swift little to no organization with poor coordination between lectures and quizzes appears that there is no ta or course staff monitoring discussion boards i am glad i didnt pay for the class disappointed though because i really wanted to learn swift	0
lectures are very monotonoussounding it would be better to make them sound more conversational with pauses questions etc granted it cannot be interactive since its not a live classroom but it can be made to somewhat sound like an interactive sessionsome slides are too verbal it would be better to have multiple small demos in a module for different slidestopics instead of just monotonically reading out the slides and then having one demo at the endtoo many lab issues no one responded or addressed them in a class with such a short span  week its very important that everything works and any questionsconcerns are immediately addressedresolvedplease consider making the lab instructions available for download say as pdf files this will be helpful for any later reference	1
totally unimpressed video lectures are terrible explanations are at best incomplete usually confusing sometimes incoherent instructor never gives an overview of the architecturedata flowstructure of active record or action pack instead describes the syntax of a handful of functions as a result you only get the most superficial understanding of the material the graded assignments are just a regurgitation of the lectures and so dont require you to take a deeper dive into the material in fact in many cases the answers to the graded assignments are listed in the assignment immediately following the question	0
a bit old version of meteor but a good course for basicssaddly this old version and the way we done gonna be deprecated soon	2
nice for practice and for some resources	4
needs more depth instructors should reference more external readings since the lectures are brief	2
the course is logical in its structure informative innovative and presented in an attractive way	4
nice and easy course i think the slides need some improvement especially for those who just study from them without explanation from the instructorthanks	3
useful only to new professionals i learned nothing new	1
is excellent however i hoped to learn more	3
the content of the course looked promising but then i took a first look the instructor is reading formulas from a slide this is missing the whole point of a online class there is no motivation for the formulars no context why they are important and from a learning point of view the course is very hard to follow no real advantage compared to reading a book on that matteri just took the economics of money and banking course which is one of the best courses i ever attended personally in class or online there are other great courses on coursera and for easy introduction to some of the concepts khan university courses are unmatched in accessabilitytoo bad that this course doesnt match up to the above examples the topics would deserve that they are presented in a way that they can be understood by a wide audience	0
just like the first one really nice layout of the course and good explanations throughout the course book	3
the pedagogy in this course is truly horrible it is severely lacking concrete relevant real world examples  in the beginning of each lecture would be super  motivating each technique this is kind of a dealbreaker furthermore the material is really dry and theoretical lacking pragmatic problem solving imo way too much time and energy is wasted on history namedropping and dry mathematical backrounds andrew ng of stanford university with his course machine learning is a great example of how it can and should be donesuffice to say it would be much more smoth fun and efficient to start with  current real world relevant problems motivating the technique then  a clear description of the technique  with concrete examples mapping the theory to practice this last part is super important and is what is lacking the most in the course one more thing the quizes and questions makes alot of silent and weird assumptions often not even clearly relating to the lecture materials there are also technical bugs and missing images in the quizes suffice to say this is a real dealbreaker	0
it is good one	4
the book really gave more details about the individual chapters hence it was easy to do the assignments and quizzes without watching the videosi recommend that specializations should follow this trend so students who find it difficult to access internet can use the book as a guidemore examples are needed to understand the concepts especially tuples and dictionary	2
felt very much like an exercise in writingbynumbers assignment instructions were too vague and the passfail grading system meant lots of classmates were upset that their work was not appreciated or understood so many people on the course do not have english as a first language that the marking is often erratic great that nonnative speakers are trying to write in english enriching the canon but in those circumstances a passfail system seems misguided	1
not worth it for the bucksinstructor has tried his best to make no sense of the subjecti would be happy for a refund	0
if you already know everything about the topic and just forgot some little things or you are very strong in calculus this may be a nice refresher otherwise not very useful really dense and little explanation i liked the youtube mit course on probability it includes bayesian statistics much more since it has good explanation of the concepts	1
great for beginners the basics are well explained	3
i had really high hopes for this course i am not a programmer though in college i learned c c and used matlab a fair amount i wanted to learn r because it is a free software versus paying a licencing fee to use spss which i have done in the past i had already completed the first week of the course and the first week in this course i went through the slides and i didnt really feel like i learned any actual programming so then to expect to answer questions where you had to program seemed a bit out of left field as a comparison it felt like they had an hour worth of slides talking about different trees and how to differentiate them then asked you to drive a tanki then took the time go through two swirl assignments which i hoped was going to fill in the many gaps left by the slides they were definitely more helpful than the slide show but i still felt like they would teach you how to add then ask you to multiplyso in general my recommendation would be not to take the course unless you have a fairly solid understand of programming otherwise you will do what i did and just wasted 	0
very formal and difficult to follow not for beginners not recommended for pros	1
very basic introduction to financial markets	2
very easy	1
the content was redundant at times at other the dots that were trying to be connected were to wide apart on the spectrum	1
it is very important to learn algorithms as it is truly said it is heart of computer programming  i am very happy and thanks for offering such a course to coursera and have just started hope will learn something so that it will help 	4
i found the course content to be too simple hence uninteresting	0
the first course i was really dissappointed with it came of as very subjective unscientific and i could not take it seriously coursera usually has more credible courses	1
excellent course with a lot of information served in the context and furthermore in the most understandable waythanks for it	4
this course is very explanatory and it has many practical life scenarios which we are not exposed in college here in india thank you very much for this course	4
well taught but not what i thought it would be	0
beautiful course four star and not five because the course its short and some topics need to be deepened	3
knowledge provided here was just a common sense	1
honestly i only finished week  i was sorely disappointed that the quizzes were locked i wasnt aware that if you audit the course you were not allowed to complete the quizzes as other courses offer this option from what i gather from week  the course topics seems really good i think it would be great if you consider letting persons who audit take the quizzes otherwise whats the use  i mean i could always go on youtube and watch videos on the same topics the difference with coursera courses is that you get the opportunity to test the knowledge gained by doing quizzes and assignment i hope you will consider allowing everyone to take the quiz my issue above is the reason why i gave the course a  out of 	0
i get really frustrated when the tutor doesnt explain lots of conceptsymbols in the materials	0
perfect for a complete beginner in the field well explained wellpaced and interesting with practical assignments learned a lot from this course thank you professor ian harris	4
its a very good lecture	4
complete waste of time i could learn the interview skls anywhere	0
low voice	3
there are many parts of the lectures that are very quiet and even with my speakers turned to max i struggled to hear while other parts were clear the course is interesting but i doubt that anyone would pay to attend this course	1
i like this course a lot professor tamy chapman is very good she explains everything in a way that makes it feel easy to understand but i would like that the teacher was the one to review our homework submissions	3
while the information is certainly good and i enjoyed listening to david hill it is too basic for me i was looking for something that wasnt an introductory course but i took it thinking the peer reviews would be worth it i had a difficult time downloading peer writing to review and i never got any feedback on my assignment i also went to the forums for discussion but there wasnt anyone adding new information it seems like a ghost class without any real live students since it is not interactive in any way i am just spinning my wheels not worth the effort	2
the worst professor in this specialization the subject really interesting and i have been studying for a while in my masters and phd in engineering so i could understand the bulk of the course this is a very important subject in data analysis and these poor explained classes could make lot of people give up the specialization statistics involves much of mathematics and calculus which make it a natural challenge for most of the people please improve these classes in order not to disappoint the student who want to become data scientists	0
excellent course  very clearly taught with good examples and programming exercises this makes a huge difference  i really engaged with and enjoyed the course i would highly recommend it	4
unclear and poorly thought out	0
its good for undergraduates and people returning to academia say before starting a masters course its a very short simple introduction i kind of wish it had more examples of language to use in academic writing contrasting good and bad examplessome of the quiz questions and final exam questions need some proofreading the videos from about week  to  have poor sound quality but still understandable	2
very good overview of the key technologies	4
i believe that exaggerated the amount of minutes per video and lack of theory but it was still a good course	2
the material was way to dry could not get interested in this class	0
more code and figure would be good for understanding	3
this course was not overly interesting it felt more like listening to someone wanting to paint everything with a socialist brush i had better things to do this has not been a class where i learned much its structure of super short videos mins with easy tests was neither challenging nor useful to confirm the value of the content in fact a number of tests quiz you on material not yet covered usually in the next unit not the best class there is	1
its a short and nice course that gives you a basic insight of how basic management technique and budgeting can help you a lot in managing financial risks and also gives you some practical knowledge of some popular financial instruments 	3
it was great i loved the fact i could watch the videos and follow the steps at my own pace the content was really good objective clear and the texts were both supportive of the subject presented and open to other approaches i recommend it to everyone interested in deepen herhis relations with the theme	4
dry and boring as hell	1
test review	3
it could provide deeper concepts with more examples	3
having almost completed this course i can say that this course provides a basic over view of the concepts of ml quality and content are lacking the professors breeze thru the concepts in few short videos no further guidance is available you are on your ownwhile the quizzes test the concepts learned no live help is available again you are on your own some course materials should be provided other than basic fancy power point slides the lectures dont do justice to the material content and quizzes some reference materials or write ups would be greatly helpful teaching assistants or moderators should be made available for each course to help out with any conceptual or programmatic questions students are left to collaborate amongst themselves and figure out a solution for a paid course i expect some real professional helpmany a times i had to turn to google to help me out if i was stuck at a problem or didnt understand a concept if googling was the only option then i do not see a value in this coursei doubt if i will continue the other courses in this specializationthanks	2
very good course i learned a considerable amount from it	3
a little bit too conceptual and very basic hadoop hands on and hdfs should be much more intensive however good material well presented and explained	2
it gets on my nerve from rd work onwards	2
worst course i took on coursera so far it was my first course i actually paid for and it turned out to be the least useful one the small number of exercises and videos does not justify the high price of the course it might have been ok if they had included the ios parts also but charging  eur for the first part alone is grossly overpriced	0
this course provides a good understanding of the dt steps with concrete application examples however it requires additional readings to be able to apply this learning	2
i again found many of the lectures to be difficult to follow along there seems to be lots of different styles of videos in the way that the person was superimposed on the slides in fact it was often impossible to read the text in the slide due to the size of the presenters head which obscured the text honestly this data science course is getting worse as the months progress you really should think of updating the content of the course if you want to continue to charge money for it  stars as i did actually learn something despite the quality of the material and its delivery	1
so first of all the material for this course in the bookdown document are very good  well structured with good sources my concern is that the coursera course does not go a lot beyond basically just referring to the document and adding quizzes  graded assignment in the last week the assignment however is nice and challenging and requires people to understand the materialsalso the course covers other great packages than ggplot eg plotly and leaflet and methods for handling spatial data i think it would be very nice if the students were challenged in these topics as well and evaluate them in a better way than just a quiz programming assignment for instancei liked the course though and i believe it can be prepared even better	2
the professor could have been a bit more serious he acted as if he was a kindergarden teacher seriously do you really need to imitate with your hand how a fish swims i dont think soalso the pronounciation of the latin words was horrible  then again all native english speakers have problems with it so dont take this remark personally	3
the videos should be completely reconsidered instructors pointing at virtual points on screen does not help at all the course creators tried to squeeze in many concepts in  weeks more examples should be provided in lectures not just abstract math eg lectures on projective transformation	1
i think the quizzes couldve been higher quality many of the images used in the quizzes were very confusing also i think more character recognition instead of focus on pin yin wouldve been more beneficial	2
there was  concept taught in the first lesson that of density then it was loads of videos of other people drawing characters not actually going through a design process and then a few assignments designing a few characters  i was hoping to learn more about some of the principles of character design wasnt blown away by this course wont be taking any more of these	1
this course is help for the communication	3
the course introduces the student to the production of a game using unity but it lacks on programming focus	2
is very useful and interesting but it has high level	1
very interesting explanations are clear and easy to understand	3
the backbone of the course was useful but i thought the lectures were lacking depth the quizzes were way too easy you didnt even need to follow the course to be able to pass itthe extra articles and links were one of the highlights	1
the course is very easy to understand and implement	3
very interesting as lay person interested in topic	2
brief and accurate course it provides useful information for writing professional emails its a pity that the free version does not include assignments and peers review	2
great course requires much selfinitiative because not all useful methods for the assignments are covered in the videos sometimes assignment questions are not described very clearlyall in all i enjoyed the course very much 	3
it has good content but there were missing classes to give more advices or clear any question students have when grading peer review homeworks there were plenty of mistakes that would have been avoided if there were more video lectures or forums with teachers	2
love this course the lectures were outstanding i took one star off for the programming assignments there is much wasted time required no test framework is given that allows developing code outside of the grader and trying to debug code by submitting to the grader is difficult and time consuming	3
investing class with ideas i hadnt considered prior to taking the course	3
very disappointing course far too much repetition a lot of opinion based on scant evidence it would have been much better as a  minute video without all the fluff and unsubstantiated inferences i would not recommend this course	0
i felt this course could have been added as sections to other courses one separate course for this topic is a waste of money	0
this is a tougher class than advertised i essentially had to clear my entire weeks plans to complete the first weeks assignment which was by far the toughest there needs to be more testing on a variety of incoming skill sets the lectures can also benefit from a recalibration because the lecturer speaks way too fast for newbies and speaks fastest when explaining the most complex concepts this makes it tough to learn	1
it is a course with lots of information but the delivery is a little weak it is a presentation with an instructor in the corner but he or she mostly just reads the presentation aloud there needs to be much more interaction much more animation and passion and the use of real people in a real environment i can tell you that my mind wondered constantly because of the lack of passion and interest in the subject being conveyed by the presenter as well as the monotonous delivery again the content is valuable and solid but that in and of itself does not make for a good course	2
it is on a very basic level as far as the neuroscience and level of material and for that reason it was not super useful to me	2
very helpful	3
a broad and inspiring course	3
it was a great course it helped me a lot reviewing my english grammar i appreciate for everything and i will recommend this course to everyone who wants to write better the english language thanks	3
this course was well organized and highlighted the most influential environmental law cases in the us it would be great if the course could be updated to reflect the recent copparis agreement	3
while the lectures were good this course had annoying issues such as invideo questions asking us to refer to previously shown material which isnt easy given the coursera interface a few assignment questions were also poorly formulated the course would have really benefited from pdf reference material for review and elaboration of topics presented in lectures at minimum a list of relevant equations would have helpedthe acoustics part of the content seemed somewhat sketchy and handwavy the assumptions and limitations behind the ruleofthumb equations and models presented werent given much weight so i wasnt able to get a good grasp of when they were relevant the electronics part was more reasonable but still suffered from some oversimplification for example the model of guitar pickups didnt include magnetic hysteresisall in all the course was worth taking but i think the material deserves more rigorall models are wrong but some of them are useful	2
interesting but a little bit too easy and shallowthe material was reused from other courses without making it all fit together well	2
this class was bizarre some of the content and lecturers was fantastic but some lecturers were quite dull and some lectures and quizzes were poorly written and misleading the class was also strangely designed and executed the amount of content per week varied significantly the vast majority of the content was in a very specific energy sector biofuels and other key sectors were almost entirely overlooked it also seems like the content is already a few years old it was more of a description of ucsds research than of the future of the energy	1
great	4
the format with a large variety of testimonials from experts in different niches of the healthcare sector was interesting however it lacked critical reflection and depth throughout the course with only a few exceptions i lacked the feeling i was learning something	1
very confusing subject which could have been better presented	0
this is just a poor sample of a course very few material low quality assignments and grading	1
this course is amazing	4
only in chinese not english subtitles	0
great course truly enjoy the intellectual challenge from the well designed quizgreat effort for the entire team keep up the good work the world need educators like you to make learning fun and challenging	4
leaves out so much of basic stuff i think this course is for th graders	1
great course easy to follow	3
very formative	4
well paced and well taught	3
good quick introduction very good easy to work through the exercise sets professor typing on he keyboard quite loud	2
good as overview but pretty shallow only some slides to read through no real exercises but constant reference to the standard project management book pretty fast clickthrough as start into project management	1
i was disappointed by the capstone i expected we would get some data set we would use to apply the analytics skills we learned instead we got an openended problem description with few if any input on yahoos operations the only data available was public data eg annual report executive interviews etc	1
i dont recommend this course at all this college doesnt spend much effort to structure this course  just putting short videos less than mins in total per a week and external references which someone else wrote the assignments are just open discussion among students and have ourselves evaluate with each other i havent learn anything from this course its just a waste of time and money coursera should inspect this course otherwise these skeptical courses can deteriorate the reputation of this mooc platform  i love the other coursesspecializations provided by other universities though	0
only the most basic of instructions for r which are bland and easily read in the documentation or other free resources there are very few best practices or real examples to use anything found within the quizzes and assignments do not match the lecture material and are contrived not worth the money	0
not for people who dont know r toolthis course needs an interesting approach to keep students wanting to study the teaching method was boring the professor was reading things from the screen  of the times he looked bored himself the topics covered in this course need more time for students to understand  weeks are insufficient	0
sorry folks but we are not learning much here	1
all video lectures feel like they are just read from a paper and it takes a lot of effort to follow and engage it is the th course im taking to get ma digital marketing specialisation and is far off the poorest the slides dont make much sense and a lot of times i have to research stuff again on other websites to actually get the point the quiz questions are sometimes not related to the topic it seems like the professor does not know enough about the subject to speak freely and engaging about the topics im quite disappointed about this course and can not recommend it i think the course should be worked over a great example of how to do it right is aric rindfleischs lecture which was engaging challenging and very well structured	0
for an introductory course you really need to move fast and stay focused as there is a large amount thrown at you in a very short time while this was all very good information i would much rather have  at least to spend more time and have more exercises with the code	2
its perhaps the most beautiful course made by really good people thanks to professor raj and coursera	4
i felt like this course was too repetitive basically all i learned were from readings and textbooks video lectures were repeats from those contents i did learn useful tools for web analytics but i wish the instructor put some of his original insights rather than presenting articles written from other people	1
really poor quality of the material	1
headed downhill lessons are starting to feel like not enough time was put into preperation or like this course was assigned as a project to some students so the professor could make a dollar like textbooks one of the instructors even said at one point they didnt have enough time what does that even mean in an online course you could be fixing it right now and improving the course this whole thing is being handled like a college course and that is crazy online courses can undergo continual improvement the college course paradigm is dying because we can do it better now fail	1
certainly not a beginners course you needed to have a good programming knowledge to make any sense of this course the final assignment asked you to do things you hadnt been taught as i hadnt done any programming for  years i certainly found this difficult fell behind and there isnt really anyone there to help almost asked for a refund but decided to try to continue im struggling to motivate myself into the second course i really hope its better than the first one	0
seemed like a ghost course issues reported with the swirl package duplicate questions in the final assessment where is the instructor 	1
great for enhancing your understanding of how nonprofits are governed id highly recommend this course for anyone involved with a nonprofit organization	4
the topic is interesting and the lectures itself were good the explanations of the algorithms and concepts was clear and easy to understand however the amount of material covered is very little i think there should either be more concepts thought or they should be covered in more depthquizzes the quizzes were very weak they didnt really tell you weather you understood the concept or not if one of the answers was wrong there was no information which one it was so you have no idea which lecture you should watch againassignments the assignments were very bad prepared in some assignments there were bugs in the provided code we werent supposed to edit the assignments itself are rather easy and can be completed quite quickly if there wasnt the grader from the grading you got no information what was wrong or which tests passed or failed most of the time it wasnt the case that the algorithm failed instead the output was not as expected by the grader although it was as described in the assignment but you never knew this part has to be improved a lotoverall i have to say that i expected much more from university of pennsylvania especially after taking the first part of the specialization which was of good quality	0
i love machine learning the course structure is awesome	3
great course very good insights about the new marketing reality	3
very good course for learning fundamentals of mechanic of materials	3
fairly well designed course and quizzes	4
terrible englishquite diffuse contentno reading texts	0
its brief but quite informative it organizes its content in a way thats both educative and entertaining at the same time love mayas style	4
good course materials and the assignment itself is pretty good but the grader is buggy not informative and wasted a lot of my time	1
the professor does not pronounce the words correctly his english grammar is bad the terms used are too difficult to understand and way of teaching is too complicated the ppts are full of errors and too direct there is no continuity i hardly learnt anything from this video	1
too hard to listen his english	0
i liked the content that was presented there was some really good advice like the importance of being disciplined in sticking to the algorithm you have designed unfortunately there was no detail at all about how to backtest where to get data for backtesting where to find research papers upon which to base an algorithm etc in other words everything was kept at a very abstract level and not enough detail was provided to actually do anything	1
this course is way too simple and too slow probably good for someone who has never done programming before	2
do this course more hardly	3
very good introduction in advanced r capabilities	4
this course is very easy to learn all its themes are so good explainedim sorry but i might to change the rate of this courseall went well until the course started reading the explanation of code  after that  i lost  and i could not continue  because it just came out of nowhere  coding  there wasnt a previous step that says  we will encode here  or are we going to do this somewhere  just appeared and disappeared as it appeared   we were very well  but i can not say much more 	1
its a shame that almost all courses are to be paid for nowadays for one i am not paying for it many will follow	0
an excellent approach for every new learner keep it upthanks	4
good start to the course though i feel more energy and enthusiasm by the instructors would uplift the course some content is not prevalent at present outdated	2
too expensive for the material it provides it is helpful and necessary but this course can be summarised in  lectures there is a very good lecture from an external speakerwhich was very good and funny at least i found it funny and i didnt realise that it was  mins long	2
programming exercises are really hard and you dont find much help	3
very easy to grasp and very useful	3
it is good course	1
the material is ok the video quality is regular and the instructors are childish i prefer the android specialization where the instructors are more mature and professional	2
helpful but the teacher is annoying and condesending	2
great course	3
the best choice to start with python	4
i strongly recommend this course to all those who are curios about modern middle east history or simply love arab culture to me this is a very indepth course which need to be accompanied by extra readings to have a more complete picture in mind im going to take the secon	4
would have liked an exercise between lessons would have liked clearer instructions for final assignment	2
very interesting course as the start of something that will get more and more interesting i am happy that i got this specialization and not only the course	3
pretty well	4
really interesting course and material and a very good instructor this would be a  stars course if it wasnt for the final project during lessons some concepts of statistics were taken as known which is okay however the final project required to utilize a combination of all new learned material on a whole different level of difficulty compared to the preceding quizzes i did not expect that jump in difficulty and enjoyed the course a lot but the final project just was a struggle	2
the professors presentation style is clear and straight to the point the course is structured very well great course so far	4
i failed to figure out how to translate the theory presented in the lectures into practice the only assignment a website audit i would have benefited from another application assignment that was a stepping stone to the fullblown audit information was interesting but not sure this is a good course for someone new to the nitty gritty of seo	1
this course seems to require a high level of foundation knowledge that i dont have i had to leave the course before completion because of that in fact most of the videos were too complex to understand without prior knowledge on the matter and the deadlines are quite tight to have time to research all the topicsi believe the course content is quite interesting but too complicated i would appreciate less text and abstract drawings on the slide maybe an intro with images maybe d of the human body to give a little bit of background on whats going to be discussed in the class	2
i found the course useful as an overview into the process of design thinking the content was delivered in an engaging manner and the examples and case studies were memorable	3
great course well designed and challenging programming assignments that stimulate learning	4
nd time trying this hard to understand subject short class	1
nice i am enjoying itexplained in simple language so it is easy to understand	3
the course contained some valuable information but the lack of projects even small ones didnt help much i would prefer a small projectassignment during the last week of the course	2
dr boyd was very engaging throughout the course his humble nature made for a very relaxing informal but highly educational learning experience a great first distant learning experience thank you kindly 	4
the content of the course is reasonable and gives an introduction to the uninitiated the peer review sysetm however relies on the experience and knowledge of others which is a flaw in how some of the coursera modules are evaluatedif you are looking to expand your technical knowledge opt for a course the has an automated test system such as the courses on data structures and algorithmsif you are just considering studying engineering this course and specialization will be a decent and simplistic introduction into the field	2
in my opinion the course is too basic many things looks like teaching years old children by serious professorsbut the material is given as natural as possible and milestones are clear and understandable	2
honestly i think the first two classes are very boring the fact that there is a  year old man sitting at a table is the antithesis of what this course should be to be honest	2
i found that the momentum build in the first course of the game design and development specialization was lost when going into principles of game design in my opinion the course became too focused on the theory where it could have combined the learnings of introduction to game development with the principles of game design in a  ish combinationhowever if your sole purpose is the theory of games and game design and you do attend the course in relation to the specialization then by all means its a decent course	2
pretty good lectures that touch on many aspects of fmri but doesnt really get into enough details to really learn about the difficulties with this methodology would be nice if they had some real data processing exercises to demonstrate someof the concepts	2
there is a lot of good information in here that is told poorly professor simply reads the slides to you for the most part foregoing practical examples in favor of sticking to abstract concepts and letting you figure out the details quizzes had errors in them that made passing them unnecessarily difficult the slides that you could download are sometimes cutoff leaving information out this is very indicative of the classes i had in college where the class was here are a bunch of whitepapersbooks read them and youll be an expert there is little in the way of helping you understand these complicated concepts and because they are complicated many argue that should absolve the professor from needing to find a way to teach them in an understandable way when other professors have been able to take complicated topics like this and distill it down to something that was both fun to learn and gave a solid foundation for going forward im sure professor hinton has contributed much to the field but i suspect his passion lies in playing with ideas and theories not in trying to teach the next generation about how to do so	1
it was very interesting but more hands on will be better	3
great course very organized and performeda more general point of view using non very complex examples and rich with applicationscongratulationsi suggest a second course using cfd and fem for examplebest regards and thanks very much for this opportunity	3
instruction manual for the mind with regards to learning	4
the course has been great and very vivid  wellchosen video materials	4
i liked this course but i think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging	3
the course was pretty good i certainly learned a lot but more hands on material would have been nice interactivethanks	4
great course	3
poor context no real examples the guy just reads what is written on the slides without further explanations	0
i really did want to take this course in a specialization mode however i sampled some of the course videos in the different courses making this specialization and decided against itin the course videos we see no teacher or lecturer just pictures of people and powerpoint slides with a flat voice in the background reading the slides in my opinion this does very little in making this topic interesting as it comes out flat and more work should have been put into making of this mooc considering one has to pay for the specialization there were also no discussion forums of any kind available more work should be put into the making of the lecture videos by the school to give it a realistic classroom experienceunfortunately i dropped out of the mooc because of the poor quality done by the school despite it being a topic of interest for me	0
the course overall has good content but some videos and case studies were dissapointing in terms of uniqueness of information you could have easily googled it tests could also be more challenging i would defitenely reccomend it to learners who are new to the industry for others it could be less informative	2
the theories and the cases give me deeply impression i think the course is very useful and grounded	3
i dont have the impression that much effort was invested in this class to present natural language processing as introductory as possible for beginners in this field ie someone who not necessarily has a background in computational linguistics	1
great course  very much informative	4
introduction is fine but was less interactive found instructor reading slides only throughout the lecture which was boring and less interesting like other coursera course i found it boring whatever text on slide i learnt but nothing interactive and practical just a slide reading very much theoretical disappointed	1
the medical device module is a bit too short and does not cover enough information in my opinion	3
i have learned a lot about the research performed related to animal welfare and i have new perspectives of what it is needed to be improved not based on my beliefs feelings or point of view but from the animals perspective and needs to have a better welfare i am so exited to be able to learn more about this topic and someday work somewhere i can apply it	4
good but many problems with platform and help center not easy to access	2
the course offered packaged essential social information in a way that wasnt overwhelming i enjoyed the pace of the course as well i would recommend this course for future students the content was beneficial for students i will teach in the future as well	3
good material but the lecture format was very dry and composed primarily of long videos	2
this was a wonderful class but due to my schedule i was unable to finish i would definitely like to take this again once i have more time	4
awesome course	4
too difficult practical exercises with the theorical background given i know that hackers skill should be used but it is too much assumption in the projects	1
its nice course but a little bit boring	2
excellent course learnt a lot and the professor was funny and engaging	4
took the mystery out of a few things that were new	2
i learned alot and i thank our teacher for motivating us not to give up and practise as much as we can 	4
very helpful course intense concepts covered and good examples to master them thanks	3
interesting course  final quiz is a little bit going deep into details	3
good course	3
its a second edition of this course i think that this edition is absolutely useless several old mans read subtitles from obsolete books under the camera no reallife examples no practice just obvious things and pure theory from dawn of dinosaurs  star for ostervalders business model canvas the real mark of this course is  stars where is the first edition of this course with original lectures of tom mierzwa i feel robbed for 	0
solid course overall only complaint is the programming assignments are a bit difficult to do based on what is taught in the lectures	2
it helps you build your essaywriting muscles gradually too much emphasis on plagiarism some flaws in the grading forms the level of the participants is quite mixed most feedback they give is useless good	1
r is a good to know tool but so many of these process are automated now you can do this quite easily in xls or spss in most cases	1
it is a good refresher course for practitioners and should be really helpful for beginners	3
if you call reading the powerpoint presentations a course then dont miss the chance and enroll here 	0
very disappointed at the lack of notes and course material i hope part  improves	0
a little light in terms of depth but very well structured and clearly presented	3
a very good course for getting a quick and effective introduction to one of the coolest daws around barra has explained everything nicely and in an easy to grasp manner go ahead if youre looking for digital music production even remotely	3
its awesome 	2
should go into more depth  esp with visual design	1
i felt overwhelmed by too much information all of a sudden in each lesson	2
too much external references	1
tough call on this the course itself is excellent  but the money grab you must pay attitude is horrible 	2
a few glitches in the assignment content but overall pretty good	3
basic introduction to python	3
it seems i have failed at week three without having to ask for the answers for three questions	1
this course is not for beginners i would not have asked my work to pay for the specialization if i knew it would take me  months to complete r programming i have a degree in economics magna cum laude so clearly im not dumb also i have nontrivial experience with stata when i read that this would be a suitable introduction for anyone i had no idea that what it would really take was a professional programmer which i am lucky to have as a partner to fill in the gapsextremely misleading	1
this course was really worth payingthank you for providing this course	4
this course is a good start if you already have a little experience with css as a neophyte i found that there was too much material for the amount of presentation time i needed many more examples and exercises i felt dejected each time the instructor said not to worry about getting it right and just experiment  thats easy to say if you arent being graded the fact is that the material is extensive and often complicated and its imperative for me as a student to be correct as fast as possible the result is that my grade a does not reflect my comprehension of the material i managed to commit the material presented to short term memory so that i could pass the course but as always happens when someone crams the information is gone from my head	2
repetitive and surprisingly dry course	2
video lectures are really bored bad presented and almost useless most if not all of the useful content is presented in sections called web tours which are collections of websites were one can find information about the specific topic of a lesson but many of the websites are bad organized difficult to readnavigate or simply outdated the course should be called web resources about iot i forced myself to keep going for two weeksmodules before i decided to buy a good book and take a more specific course like the one about realtime systems	1
 this course is not for beginners in r programming huge gap between lectures and assignments swirl lessons are cool but anyway they dont explain enough i understand that studying is not always a joy but lectures of this course are boring first slides come with brief comments of instructor and second it seems like the instructor speaks with no preparation as there are a lot of stammers tongue slips sort of kind of etc it annoys a lot	2
thank you for this course the rolling stones is not very famous band in my country russia	4
good slides i learned a lot of iot and ar specially iotunfortunately the professor only reads the slides i was expecting more from yonsei university	2
great course i loved it recommended	4
great content instructor very easy to follow and provides great examples	4
databases very difficult to work with and badly programmed	0
i think the course needs to be restructured in order to be more practical and in order to go more deeply into theoretical material most of the course is a little superficial most classes could be summarized for exemple in talking about selection procedures the only tool discussed more deeply is interview the was no discussion about personality psychological test or other tools most contents of amys classes are abstract stacy class however is more practical it is a nice course but it can go more deeply into theory and most classes could be summarized	2
data structure of python is quite easy while this course has explained it very detail	4
i found some of the topics repetitive and trivial already covered in previous courses of the specialization however there was good advice that still makes it a worthwhile course	2
really pleased to click in the fantastic course worth your time	4
a collection of links to other sites and short and highly generic videos	0
not in depth enough	1
there are some fatal problems in its oj system	2
very well presented unfortunately i think the order was a bit strange we focused on data analysis instead of basics of data generation in an introductory course i would have liked to see a bit more what different data looks like vectors rasters etcsome of us live and work in countries that dont have a lot of data im a south african and i work in malaysia california the karroo and borneo have different amounts of information available were not learning gis to analyse data because we dont have much data available were building the datawe spent too much time on riverswatersheds i get that hydrology is nicks field but some us will work with cities or population or roads planning farmlands  a bit of variety would be nicethe data should not be available off the coursera page  we should have to get it off the internet so we get familiar with public data resources the websites should have the broadest data  good regardless of what country youre in	2
good initial overview to the topic most code is actually provided to the student preventing deeper learning via trial  error however it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject dr severance is excellent  entertaining and clearly very knowledgable for any novice programmers looking to understand how python interacts with databases this is the best place to start	3
i dont think the course is setup for a beginner or a person who has never used rvery frustrated with needing to search the internet for help on everything that the course is supposed to be teaching me	1
great course for an introductory knowledge of the energy business	3
i was disappointed with the treatment of the main concepts they were cursorily dealt with examples from the real world and a more graphic explanation esp of the crystal defects would have helped otherwise all the main points were covered	1
while the last module of this course is very interesting and kept with the specialization the first  modules are a waste of time for the most part why would i want to learn about att for two weeks the amount of useful concepts introduced in the first  modules wont take more than  minutes if unnecessary things were removed	2
not impressed with the teaching styleseems that lectures were being read and not taught	0
they jump around too much and it is very hard to follow often i feel like i missed out on content	0
great course to learn the wonders of the universe by understanding a littler of how it works saludos desde venezuela	4
the course was interesting but i think coursera is not quite what it used to be the courses are more expensive this one was  you cant do it free in a practical way which on principle excludes people they are simply replays of old videos and people are not inspired to participate in the forums	2
its useless and lacking enthusiasm	0
enjoyed it very much	3
very helpful for healthcare informatics professional	3
good but nowhere near as indepth as some of the other courses found on coursera	2
relative low efficiency to learn	2
needs to be more concisenick seems very passionate and trying to reach a broad audience but overly explaining topics is creating lecture fatigue for me for instance every video starts with welcome back this is why people like this meat of the video this is what we just talked about see you next time i really just need the meat of the video part these videos are  minutes long each they are very short and therefore i do not need an introductioncloseout for each individual one the module overview and module recap videos are sufficient to serve that purposeoverall i learned the basics and will probably take the next gis course because i like the coursera framework but i think this particular course could be much more condensed	1
excellent i hope more people get interest on the topic	4
toooo easy	3
an excellent overview of dinosaurs and birds the closest some of us will ever get to a paleontology class outside of enrolling in a university	4
im not a conversational learner i like to learn via the puzzle method	0
the course can be summarized as ok here are some tools that can be used now read the documentation stack overflow and some papers that we give you links to each week there are just few videos what i expect from a course are baby steps and clear guidance about good practices of course you can learn it all from the internet  i am taking a course to get something i will not easily find elsewhere a good teacher who will guide me through optimal approaches	1
fairly good and amazing course	3
the course has many mistakes especially the quizzes solutions the staff was not very active answering forum questions in some way i felt disappointed taking this course because the quality is very poor in comparison to the other three courses of this specialization however i hope this review helps the staff to improve the quality of this course for future students considering that the teacher has a great methodology to explain the content	1
fantastic good work that the teacher can compact the course section to less than minute videos each week and it is clear easy to grasp    help a lot for my initial study mla format and work cited page are great too    thanks	3
i expected something else	0
this course is neither high level nor low level after having taking cloud computing concepts part i and  which were excellent i expected a continuation of the very deep level of technical material this course doesnt do this instead it is sort of much higher level except that the instructor fails to stay at the high level and will suddenly go deep  but without providing the detail so that someone to whom this is new will be totally lost given that i was expecting the technical depth of ccc parts  and  i already had much of the knowledge that was presented and could figure out what the instructor was trying to present but i felt bad for someone who wasnt already familiar with the material it is my opinion that the course needs to be taken offline and redonenote apparently i took a prior version of ccc parts  and  so my comments on those two courses may or may not apply anymore	1
this isnt a beginners course i dropped out in first week i took every note i could and reviewed again and again i really think the instructor is an intelligent man but im not quite sure he understands how to teach well im really disappointed that i didnt get to take anything away from this class	1
full of great ideas about teaching character i see that my approach to teaching has shifted and my students are benefiting	3
its more or less a repetition of what youve learned in all the courses tying four peerreviewed assignments together into a somewhat contrived project not bad but doesnt really add much value to the courses before	2
good course for beginnersalthough students with little coding experience will find this course a little slow	3
good job on the explaining cdn conceptsin the two first modules the lecturer just read from the slides	2
dr chuck is a great instructor breaks the concepts down with great examples	4
overall it was good however the content delivery could have been better	2
the course is great but i hope i can get to the final project i have a little bit experience in python so i skipped the first two courses of the specialisation project but i still want to try the th one which is locked to me now	3
lecture component not as concise or well edited as expected	2
good course	4
nice but lacking would like it to cover more content specially around handlebars	2
very very introductory this course explores the buddhist theory of suffering and liberation by comparing it to evolutionary psychological theoriesit is not a deep course on buddhism  it lacks any substantive discussion of differences between buddhist schools of the difficulty of reconstructing the historical buddha a problem as difficult as reconstructing the historical christ of the fact that buddhism as popularized in the west is actually quite different from any of the asian forms of buddhism etcalso evolutionary psychology is controversial in its own right  one criticism of it is that it creates justso stories about the origins of mental processes that are impossible to verify or falsify these objections are well known but are not confronted in the coursea scholarly much sounder and deeper course is the one on tibetan buddhism from university of virginia it suffers from truly appalling presentation the video lectures are some of the most boring i have ever watched but the diversity of angles from which buddhism is examined and the depth of content are really outstanding	0
too superficial	0
took a bit long before the course actually started but when it did it was a great course	3
this is the first coursera course that i have taken and i was extremely glad to have taken it robert wright is a wonderful lecturer  extremely intelligent engaging and also adds some fun to the contentthank you robert  i learnt a surprising amount in many unexpected areas i am glad to have encountered you and am already beginning to seek out other material that you have produced	4
i was led to believe that i would be learning the fundamentals of graphic design which to me means learning how to use photoshop indesign etc this is more about learning how to create art in general not exactly what im looking for	0
great course i had so much fun 	4
yet to start but am loving it already	3
uninspiring teacher repetitive material that could have been consolidated with month  altogetherdid most of my learning from the supplemental readings	0
a wonderful journey through the evolution of photography thoroughly organized and full of interesting and original inputs i would love moma to set up a second one	4
i found this course disappointing whilst the presenter margaret meloni was enthusiastic and pleasant to listen to the content was very sparse indeed a large part of the content each week was simply reading a presentation which you could get from a book i would expect an online course to be more interactive have more videos and more varied content i found the case studies where you had to imagine a real life situation and select a decision useful  there was one of these per week when i think there could have been more perhaps three a week the course would also have been improved by the use of peer assessment on the assignments this would have made them feel more worthwhile and that someone else was actually reading them	1
this course gives you a general overview over nutrition it is a good start for those who want to have an healthier diet personally i already knew most of the information provided and i am a bit further into the eating healthy process the course is well done anyway and worth a look	2
outstanding quality of the professors really pedagogically and atractive classes not a display of presentations this is eyetoeye kind of presence comprehensive but extremelly compacted information comprehensive bibliography that includes all the topic treated or barely mentioned its an enjoyable trip to the concept of magic and the social understanding of that word in the middle ages throught the eyes of catholic jewish and astroscientists of the period	4
this is should be your go to option if you are looking for brushing up  learning fundamentals of english grammar the course material is simple  to the point and accessible to a all regardless of the level of your english fluency levels however this course lacks a an active discussion forum and the peer graded assignments are designed in such a way that often it is impossible to discuss doubts or explore further nuances  other than that the course meets all that it sets out to achieve	3
the only reason to take this course is because the certification will look good on your resume dont expect to learn anything new if you are already in it or related field i passed the tests without going over the material there is a shortage of original content although their graphics and effects department did a good job and mostly they expect you to read outside resourcesaudit the course for free to get familiar with the content but only pay if you need the certification for professional reasons	0
for beginners its a  star course once explains a lot of really too basic information and the instructor is more like a buddy than a teacherintermediates will literally fall in sleep because of the excess of basic explanations and no intermediate or advanced explanation at allas an advanced this course disappointed not only because of lack of important information that not even in forums was answered but it depends too much of the good will of mentors assistentsone big fall in this course is thats only in video so no option to do it while in motion like in a bus or any other noisy placea bigger one is thats totally dependent of others students to give the grade so you stay hostage of others and the instructor or mentors do not care about itthe biggest fall is that you will always pass it once you can try some many times as you want so eventually you will pass so the grade is just formal not seriousthe good side of the course is that it seems to be very completed so you will learn all the contents you need to work with angularjs	2
as an introductory course the content was good but i wish the approach was more analytical and more hands on rather than history of recommender systems  what happened in the s i would have been happier if the course was able to throw light on the latest stuff in this field the latest mathematical techniques etc	2
我是个machinelearning的新手但是我听懂了大部分	4
loads of information and the pace was great for fitting into my busy schedule	3
interesting course but would have liked some additional video discussions from practitioners in the field	2
i was disappointed by this course i thought it was poorly organized and focused too much on trivia and not enough on motivating and contextualizing ancient egyptian civilization i was hoping to come away from this course with a richer understanding of ancient egypt the lectures were surprisingly dry	1
amazing course amazing instructor yaakov chaikin everyone who wants to improve their frontend skill should take this course it is intuive concice and very clear and the instructor is amazing and fun	4
boring	0
an intresting course lectures are small and very easy to comprehend the whole course has a great structure and help you learn and remember things	3
the videos were not always easy to understand because of the unclear pronouncing of the key speaker also although most of the tests were easy to complete the ones that you had to write the answer down instead of only choosing the correct answer were hard since if one word you wrote was wrong you lost the question	2
although again very interesting i found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses 	2
decent course not very satisfied with the assignments as they are suited for graphlab	2
all its about visual design i was expecting more deep on tableau usage	1
work with real industry data is so much fun	3
instructors or tas are not available in discussion forums and the course is focussed on promoting graph lab proprietary package of the course sponsor maybe you can have a look not beneficial if you are serious about learning ml	1
better than previous but still not good quility	2
excellent course but not fully covered	3
great course easy to understand	4
the peer review assignment part is reallyuseless	1
thank youwith all my respect to authors i skipped parham again and found a few errors for example statements like if bool  true and layout related errors in the starter app at the end of the course	2
excellent course but is not for beginnersexcellent professor too	3
if you arent familiar with cooking and nutrition this course is a good fit however if you have a bit of background in healthy eating you may not get as much out of this course	1
unbelievably difficult for understanding	2
its more focus on the functional programming rather scala programming language itself but nevertheless its fascinate to switch the mindset from one to another and think about the a totally different perspectives	3
its absolutely fantastic	4
more practical application would be helpful in solidifying knowledge concepts seem abstract outside of any programming practice additionally flow of lectures seems scattered at times concepts are introduced then not expounded upon this creates a distracted learning path that makes it difficult to follow the lessons from a beginner programmers view	0
great introduction for new leaner	3
information presented was too basic	1
the weakest of the series so far overlap with some of the other courses too much art therapy	0
this is the third or fourth time ive reviewed this course but it still keeps asking me to	3
all the information discussed were already present in the slides poor presentation throughout the course an however interesting connection between the internet of things and augmented reality	1
great learning course	3
im really sorry to give this rating but i have no choice the course was horrendously boring and so far removed from the interesting and interactive work that we had done in the previous sections of the specialisation this is such an unfortunate course to have as a requirement to complete the specialisation and especially the final hurdle to get into the capstone moreover it was the longest of all the courses thus the least interesting and also the longest  makes little senseas i said im sorry to give this rating but it needs to be said the teacher seems like a great guy and im sure hes killing it teaching statistics and r studio at uni but using r studio to such a standard just doesnt seem like the everyday work an hci designer would do a statistician or data specialist yes but a ui designerperhaps you could make the course higher level avoid the indepth r studio and make it  weeks like all of the other courses	0
i started the course with high hopes and i was beginning to enjoy the subject matter but it became very tough for me to continue because the sound in the videos was not very clear it became very difficult understanding what the instructors said either because the placement of the mic was not very good or the instructors were not speaking very clearly	1
the lecture gave industrial terms and key words which is good but it is mainly reading from the slides no elaboration or illustration	2
this course has been dumbed down so much that no moderately intelligent person should be subjected to it coursera really needs to rethink its approach to teaching i can only express my sympathy for those were seduced into actually paying for this course	0
this course is brilliant and the lecturer is a very good speaker	4
why is this course dangerousi took this course because first i liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle the second law of thermodynamics but as it turned out they dont have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means they always forget the second part of it it is just valide in a closed system i think everbody will agree that the earth for example isnt a closed systemin the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught but if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you one glance at the discussion forum shows they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students but critical questions with scientific papers who show different facts get ignored for weeks and months they are cherry picking they just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course opinion believe and dogma in this respect they are so dangerous that is the same principle how cults workmaybe their goal stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one but also here you have to be careful when they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of  in my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way for sure it is not helpful but again the truth doesnt fit in their world viewfurthermore they teach that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the universe balancing entropy this isnt just lack of understanding physics or history or flow mechanics it is just insanein summary this is not a history course but the teachings of a lying exaggerating cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics cosmology chemistry biology or even historyso please if you take this course be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions	0
i was very disaappointed by this course in fact a bit more so than by the unwritten course that has run concurrently with this one i was very put off by the professors simply opening his book and trying to remember what hed said there and then in front of his audience reduce it down to a videoed talk he needed to put some effort and thought into understanding his topic from the point of view of an audience that is inevitably very very different from the one he had in mind if any in particular as he was writing the book if he didnt have time for proper preparation he should have found another medium for flogging his publicationsby and large everyone who is from the us im not and who teaches about the us constitution emphasizes its uniqueness indeed they have a point it was the first and admirably the shortest modern written constitution however uniqueness isnt unique among nations all nations are somehow unique undertanding a nation including thir constitution has to involve looking at both humdrum normality as well as uniqueness i felt that the course would have been more substantial if it had been built on the obvious fact that the us revolutionaries were englishmen fighting for an englishmans rights and indeed what they created had both the worst and the best traits that englands historical jurisprudence offered social stare decisis has been a major stumblingblock not only for commonlaw countries but as well for countries that follow other sorts of jurisprudencethe course was embarrassingly bad	1
dry videos most classes are someone showing how they do something their way rather than guiding or teaching with the intent to have the student absorb and reapply principlesvery difficult for a student to absorb material from this video series	1
brian caffos lectures were rambling and confusing with excessive use of jargon without proper explanation his graphs were overwhelming with information and little effort was made to explain the graph otherwise the other lectures were very good concise and clear thank you	2
highly effective for who are involved in water resources management	4
this is so wonderful but i wish i would receive the printed copy of the certificate by post too	3
some good sections of the course but others are not explained well at all overall valuable material	3
very basic the hands on exercises are not very hands on and do not actually add much value	0
thanks so much professor kenneth pienta and your team you are so well prepared and the presentation is empowering one is able to follow the step by step flow of information and tips i enjoyed this course as a health educatorpromoter it helps me act as a good source of information thank you once again	4
frankly speaking it should be the most disappointing mooc i have ever enrolled so far the professors teaching is clear and comprehensible but the depth of the course content cannot meet the university level especially from a worldwide renowned school like wharton quiz is the most terrible part which seems like nobody could get it because of the ambiguous questions and paranoid answer area personally i like many other mates am really grateful to coursera for offering everyone this equal opportunity but courses with that kind of quality but staggering price will destroy the companys brand we all want coursera to go further and better but few people prefer monopoly businessman rather than prestigious professors and diligent intellectuals	0
it gives a very good overview of the fundamentals of graphic design also how to start thinking the graphical way	4
despite the arguments of this module are extremely interesting and very useful for robotics i think the way they are treated is very poorin my opinion lectures are so superficial that it is almost a waste of time to follow themlectures are completely useless and most of the time quizzes are note related with themin order to solve quizzes you have not only to recover prior knowledge that it is obvious but also to search for new arguments somwhere in the web in some other courses where contents are better treated and explained in that contest what are the quizzes what should quizzes have to test if no content is givenmoreover it often happen that without a clear support from the lectures questions are confused and ambiguous it is quite difficult to follow the teaching path and to enrich my knowledgei think it is a very bad way to make a course and often the pleasure to follow disappears leaving a sense of frustration and futilityi arrived at the end of the course just because im doing the specialization otherwise i would have left in the middle of the first weekim very disappointed	0
very elementary coursework quizzes were too simple while i expected some challenging questions thatll make you think please improve the assignment quality	0
a poor end to a poor coursera specializations	0
its a good start	2
material was good but it doesnt tell you to pay for the course until you take the quiz	0
worth completing as much for the demonstrated pedagogy as the covered material	4
the last assignment is a timewaster and really poorly designed not all adults are into coloring this is not elementary school and whats the point of coloring a picture of the arch for you frankly i cant be bothered to look up sources for the descriptions of roman soldiers attire and especially to figure what each number is pointing to it wasnt even always clear what the numbers on the template referred to and two of the numbers were missing in addition there were a lot of glitches with the grading software finally our questions were almost never answered otherwise i found this to be an interesting course and i learned quite a bit from it although it could have been condensed into three or four classes at the very most the video lectures were videotaped a bit strangely with professor fine often seeming to talk to an invisible person on the right or the left of the camera instead of at the viewer the videos i liked were mostly the office hours ones and the one with the interview with rabbi elliot cosgrove at park avenue synagogue i could have gotten a very good grade on this course but the last assignment ruined that no i will not be recommending this course or any others by this professor	1
very good start in the data science world	3
the course is misleading  the difficulty ramps up too quickly with the result that those who do not have a programming background will not be able to keep up it should be toned down and reworked or split into two courses cramming everything into  weeks makes everything too difficult	0
good intro for beginning students	4
really strange kind of childish	1
good course	2
this course was not a beginning level course as advertisedtest cases for assignments were neither document nor otherwise explained within the course materials quizzes during the lecture were often unrelated to the material just presented or were given before the relevant material was taughtthe course creators obviously put a lot of time and effort into this course so it is difficult for me to write such a critical review however they missed the mark with this one enough that i cant recommend the courseunfortunately i will not be completing this course only due to the fact that i have run out of time and patience to complete the last assignment	0
the course is very cheap however training material has poor quality	0
the material presented was of course useful but i never really felt like i understood how it all tied together or what the big picture was i think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpfulalso as a suggestion i feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture	2
it seemed to me like an ad or präsentation for this high school it had some interesting thoughts in it but not much information	1
very clear structured and interesting material easy to follow and understand	4
loved the course very professional instructor was very warm and explained complex topics simply very nice combination of videos demos and lecture my only comment is that the quizzes do not align perfectly with the lesson there are numerous examples of being quizzed on something that isnt taught until the next lesson	4
hated the course and the content i truly regret investing my money on this course	0
excellent course material apart from getting introduced to ml also picked up some working knowledge in octiave programming	4
a good introductory course but it would have been nice to see a bit more of the math behind the models i dont think the assessments were worth upgrading to the paid version of the course though they were basically memorization and regurgitation directly from the lecture videos with very little if any thinking required a bit disappointing from an institution like wharton	2
very bad demonstration	0
a good overview for budgeting and scheduling projects the course focuses on the basics but also does a good job of introducing more advanced methods for both financial and schedule management	3
felt a little rudimentary until the last week i hope the specialization picks up after this point	2
i was interested in this course but as it stands it is more like marketing hype than a proper course for one thing it tries to cover far too much material in  weeks within the limited scope of the beta test i started the node red stuff it looks easy but the lecturer didnt make it clear what it was for anywaya much more thorough introduction should have been given to everythingthe lectures on the rasberry pi were a joke in order to do the course within  weeks i would have had to order a rasberry pi before getting to these lectures a clear guide to course prerequisites and the rasberry pi and sensehat must be providedneither of the tutors seem very happy about their job this is a small point and not a show stopperoverall  dont issue this course without major revisions perhaps a new course team	1
wonderful class that helped to clarify the different political theories for me i would highly recommend t	4
to easy to sink tons of time into the final coursework	3
great course	4
ive just wasted  hours going through repetitions of what ill learn but not actually learning anything why is it called free if i cant submit answers to quizzes unless i upgrade firsti now have an adverse reaction towards that course that it doesnt really have much content to it and im not the least eager to upgrade thank you very much	0
i learned a lot	4
great job	3
good contents but a bit overcomplicated assignments	1
awesome lectures and courses materials i enjoyed it greatly many thanks to the instructor	4
seeking out supplemental material is not only helpful but necessary this course does not provide a foundation of knowledge for inferential statistics so much as present several equations and functions and describe how one might use them	0
huge gap from lectures and swirl to the assignments	0
not so much live examples full of theoriesthis has been thought in class it self	1
this course is very useful professor explain every concept and coding details very clearly so much thanks	4
to difficult to enjoy unfortunately	0
not really useful  i would like to email in a pdf of my comments covering this course and the second course in this series	0
totally not worth having the certificateseasy assignmentsgood for people who never programmed before	0
great course	4
sorry but of no real use except to people totally	1
this class is not challenging at all	1
this was the toughest of all the data science courses so far without the statistical inference book the practical exercises and the swirls it would have been very challenging to pass the course these were very valuable tools the videos that are available when i couldnt get a practical exercise right also helped me a loti majored in mathematical statistics  years ago but have never used it in my whole career but in my opinion this course explained the concepts much better than how it was done  years ago congratulations to everybody involvedi have learned so much and was really proud of myself when i passed this one	3
a great overview of the tm pipeline with some very valuable and actionable insights	4
i enjoyed this course it was more challenging than the first one in the sequence especially in the graphsearch portion the last  weeks are much more simple but it is still essential for any serious student of cs to learn about data structures especially common and practical ds such as heaps and hash tables	4
everything is great and im so excited to be here and learn from duke university	4
i am a bit disappointed the main concepts would require more explanation there are too many requests for essay writting and it sometimes feels an infomercial for the school	2
not enough students to give review grading and earn a grade	2
profoundly knowledgeable but very soft spoken professor  was difficult to maintain interest and energy especially in this remote learning mediumdecided to table this course for a while and revisit when my learning attitude is calmer and more inline with his communication style	1
the assignment grader is not good enough	3
i think the course was too superficial and didnt cover enough topics to be a standalone course it could be part of a greater course my feeling is that this wasnt worth  dollars and that such a small course was put together just to charge for one more module	2
 please the instructor speak loud and clear as english is not my first language please the instructor and mentor check qa and answer them timelytoo many information to understand in  weeks of courses ruby rails gem bundle rspec unit test black box test and foodfork heroku and only  weeks the instructor could not make these knowledge areas which i list in point  clear instructor said that we are not cover this point in this lecture in different lessons several times so skip over something until this course finished i suggest that add  more weeks to this course i like the assignments from this course these assignments job help me recall what learned in the courses	2
most of contents are already in the books like cracking the coding interview and similar ones if you have them you dont need to take this courseit can be good for students who have never had an interview	1
excellent ms colleen is a fantastic instructor	4
the course is ok but i found that there were some technical quirks that could be ironed out first example is to download the text files in the final assignment the command wget is invaluable how to leave safe mode if the name node is in safe mode virtualbox is default to  bitubuntu when the image is  bitcentosredhatin addition the course content is a bit little it says  weeks but i finish it in  days perhaps it is about quality and not quantity	2
course was very informative and helpful i learnt a lot about unity and its tools and concepts but there was very less scripting coding in the course	3
the pair review its really not the way to go if you dont have the horse power to check it yourself create automated tests to pass like other courses	1
much of the syntax is outdated in updated external libraries would have been helpful to include python  syntax for all programs slides were not translated to english so external sources were required to understand many of the slides	1
this is amazing course easy and informativethank you	3
a very thorough look at how technology can be incorporated into a blended learning or completely virtual learning environment	3
this course and material does not articulate the google cloud platform offerings maybe google does not want to compete with microsoft azure and aws alike if google itself has approved this google cloud platform trainings on coursera then vola i am out i am way better off supporting aws and azure at least they have tons of good trainings and stuff to keep folks in the field excited	0
have to say this course is not useful	0
it was very well done and very informational thanks again professors for your dedication and time to educate society	3
nicely taught by sir all basics are covered very nicely	4
this class is an extreme example of an introduction to a subject  very basic information i would guess that anyone who actually knows the term internet of things and was able to find this course already knows all of the content presented here for completeness and ensuring that everyone is on the same page i suppose it it required i took off one star for how basic yet drawnout the information is it could have been covered in a single week the other two stars came off because of how tedious the peerreview assignments are and how little they add to the understanding of the content it is not hard to understand so the assignment ends up just being busy work the two stars i gave were because the instructor seems knowledgable and the rest of the specialization looks promising	1
with my background i found this part of the course rather slow but i can see why its necessary for people with less of a software background	3
pretty exciting i found several improvements compared to course  jack or parham should take part in discussions i guess	3
very basic and trivial information that can be easily summarized in an article not need for a whole course	0
good way to get started with doing from just listening or reading	2
good course but need more assignments	3
too theorical and bold course	0
self explanatory good assignments very helpful	4
interesting content but not well presented faculty read the script and struggled with pronunciation fluency and generally engaging presentation combination of basic content on the one hand and highly specialised information  terminology without explanation on the other was not helpful to learning	1
very good basic course for everyone interested in the european union here you can learn about the past and the present state of affairs in the eu as well as get to know some future challenges the course is filled with lots of eurelated facts and statistics and presents the eu from different points of view i would say the course is quite a light one there are no peerreviewed assignments and quizzes are rather short and easy but it definitely gives food for thought be aware that the videos are in french but with english subtitles	3
the most boring course i have ever done in my life soporific course content interesting but professor is just reading slides with reading mistakes every  words i would not recommend this course at all	0
thanks for this great course it was very interesting and informative and i learned a lot about elearning	3
leading to much sources which is really good enough to seek for more info in law	2
personal difficulty in understanding accents my own lack of ability	0
the problem is that the only feedback a student gets is from other students i only received  feedback from the supposedly  each week for  weeks i gave  stars because the videos are very good and good concepts but i paid far more money than they now charge so i doubt i will finish the certificate because the final course relies only on student feedback which is nonexistent	2
relevant materials but lecture delivery is rather dry	2
i suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own instead of just read and run	3
clearly the target audience is a younger and newer poet i learned some new terms and enjoyed some new poetry overall it was just okay	1
good intro to the very basics emphasis on good standardsnot enough indepth analysis or practices maybe for the next upcoming series	2
video content barely summarizes the outline of each module the questions in the quiz are not though provoking peer discussion are rather superficial and do not cover half the content of the coursereadings are ok show good sources but there is no real discussion about them in the videos or in the quizzes	0
well it is a good course concepts are well taught i enjoyed it you should try the course	4
this course is sorely out of date and in need of a refresh using  statistics to describe the state of global terrorism today may be an interesting history lesson but only serves to show how much more dangerous previously safe regions are today	0
very disappointed with this final course little to no support discussion forum provides some level of help but you are basically on your ownvery challenging to come up to speed with natural language processing techniques if you have never taken any class about itmy recommendation to jhu and coursera is to add a separate course for nlp where you cover all the basics and then have the capstone	1
no real applicable knowledge gained	0
it is a awesome course and the teacher is very good he really knows what he is doing and he knows how to teach a class	4
i am only on week  of this course and so far i am thoroughly enjoying it the videos are informative and well put together very interesting to learn about the history of the internet and how it has evolved i currently work for an smaller isp in northern alberta and after stumbling into this job i ended up loving networking and computers this really helps with an introduction to some fundamental concepts of the internet thank you for providing this course	4
the assignments are highly dissociated from the course material also once the due date has passed sharing the best solution would help so as to give insights on what could have been done better	1
aric is an amazing professior who is passionate about digital marketing which is evident in the way he has structured the course his knowledge and understanding of this evolving concept and his ability to explain and teach the course in a	4
thank you so much for the course it is one of the best one i have hadthe material was explained thoroughly additional resources were extremely useful and the videos provided sufficient examples also the teaching style and humor are greatly appreciatedi learned a lot while also consolidating my knowledge from mr rossiters class html css and jsmany thanks	4
very good place to start for beginners with some scientific information easy and quick to do food demonstrations basic enough that students can build upon them depending on what is available at handsome ideas just tend to be redundant throughout the weeks but i guess that is what she wants to stress on no to processed food  i just wish you kept the discussion boards open so we have a platform to discuss ideas and exchange recipes	2
very well made course although i wish to see more on other countries because egipt israel and palestine were making most of lectures	3
for people who dont know programming at all only	0
a very good course i recommend people who want to learn valuation should do this course	4
too repetitive and i do not want to submit a video of my self teaching	1
good but too slow at times considering it is just a high level view of basics distractingly weird hand gestures	2
i can only infer that this courses target audience is rich pregnant women who care about shoe shopping and celebrities unfortunately i am none of those things and had to cringe my way through the examples watching the videos at x speedthe course itself is incredibly shallow even for a survey course and basically serves as an ad for one of the professors own products  graphlab create youll be much better off taking andrew ngs course which is significantly more in depth and forces you to write your own solutions to problems instead of relying on a proprietary librarythe only reason to prefer this course is if you really dislike the idea of using matlab	1
no new learning during this course working on the capstone project is practically optional	1
its pretty good start for this fastgrowing field in businessand im terribly eager to learn r d	4
a very helpful welldesigned course learned and enjoyed 	4
kinda disappointed that in a course about communication margaret can be such a soso communicator herself except that the course is good and offers some cool tips on how to deal with that new ways of communication that we must deal of	2
sorry to say but for me as a nonnative english speaker most videos are hard to follow its because speaker talks fast unclean and with bad sound quality of course im not used to the mathematical english terms also the many animations with the slides made it hard for me	1
information is useful but still it is a shame to split one month course to 	1
i did all four courses  the whole specialization each course in itself was aright and i learned new things however the course certificate is meaningless it neither states the content nor the effort for example the hours instead it even says noncredit course this is despite the fact that the course equates  pdus and counts towards the uci project management certificate programm as it was described in the faq i feel betrayed how can i apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere	0
the lecturer seems to be reading off the text  could be better	2
very useful and easy  i just love maya	4
great teacher and very good explanation of the subject	4
it was a very useful course with a lot of practical examples	3
i would like to see the more practical information the course is  built on pmbok i can read this guide on my own outside the course in the course i prefer to see how the practice corresponds with the theory	2
course moved a little too slowly	1
i like that is not only about dogs but also on apes including humanseasy to listen towould love more articles or other reading materials in this course besides the book	3
more concise coding tutorials and less search on your own on the internet needed it is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams	2
course is so clear to understand and content is fair enough to learn basics of financeit wont make you finance guru but you will be able to learn essentialslecturer david standen has ability to transfer his knowledge to audience so the lessons are easy to understand and comprehensiblemore graphics more animations or more visual items can be added to lessons to boost comprehension	3
perfect teacher nice job	4
it is a great course however some practical examples to try would benefit users	2
the lecture quality should be dramatically improved even at x speed i feel iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos in the conclusion iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is new but an amazon search shows several seem to exist and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old even more than a decade in some cases so i think better materials for more organized slides must exist ive taken more than  coursera classes and this has been my least satisfying  i do appreciate the introduction this provided for free and plan to keep learning in this space though not in this course sequence	1
very shalow information i would like if this course had a contination	2
i honestly thought this course was all over the place and too general it also seemed to be full of self  congratulations about what upenn has accomplished with its research i wanted more depth in a more targeted approach to improving my life	1
very good course	3
great course	4
extremely poor help and feedbackalmost no replies on discussion forums from mentorspeers so many issues end up unresolved considering how difficult this course is compared to other courses the lack of real assistance is appallingseemingly outdated lessonsa lot of errors i get come from version discrepancies lessons should be checked over if i have to google problems to complete stepbystep lessons the lesson is extremely illpreparedthis is enough to make me abort this specialization	1
this particular module week  is written for those students who are already have at least a nodding acquaintance with the softwarethe videos move so fast that i am not able to detect what is going on please believe me when i say that i run a copy of fusion  at the same time as a particular instructional video is playing i toggle from one to another taking notes from the instructional video when possible still it takes me weeks not days to understand what the professor is doingit is true that there are several online tutorials with regard to using the sketch tools contained within fusion  i have been reviewing the tutorials that i am able to find  and i have learned quite a bit of howto information that this particular module does not providewhy is it that some of us who are new to the fusion  environment have come to understand that we need to spend hours of our time to fill in the blanks of week are we to keep searching other sources so that we can learn what has not been taught in week  if so whybill clark	2
excellent course i have learnt a lot about international justice tribunals arbitration and international law highly recommended for general knowledge and for law students	3
difficult but very useful course	3
teaching should really be improved	0
content is good nice details and the labs are great although you can do these anytime as they are outside of coursera the quizzes could be more challenging also should you run into any technical difficulties or have a question that is best answered by an instructor you wont find anyone	2
ill say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization if you have the skills to complete this course then you dont need to take this course if you dont have the skills to complete this course you will not complete this course the course instruction is at  feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will not teach you the skills required to complete the assignmentsi recommend the machine learning course from bills colleagues at university of washington that is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments though still very challenging	1
its too diffult for some of the questions in the quiz have no idea or support to solve them	2
great course 	4
very suitable for new comers of programming for me who has programming experience for more than  years and just want to catch up with the mainstream of programming in python its a bit too simple but thats my problem not the class the class is arranged nicely chunk presented very well and clear i like it very much	4
the course was very basic it was nicely taught and the examples and the lectures were really enjoyable however some shortcomings i felt were that the colors in the slides could have been a bit clearer another thing was that some concepts were introduced in the lectures which were not explained completely a real beginner would not be able to understand them which would in some parts defeat the purpose of the courseother than that i felt the course was really structured well the assignments were easy and the quizzes did test the knowledge about the subject taught so far it was such that any new person would not feel discouragedkeep up the good job people	3
good course	3
i found this was a wellorganized fundamental course despite my slight disappointment that i wanted to gain more knowledge and concepts on some other analysis methods if you look for analytics course that focuses more on tool or skill this is not the one	3
needs more case studies and examples	1
good for beginner except for javascript part where you will need to study js externally as it may appear quite complicated without programming knowledge not so good for experienced desktop developer who wants to learn web its all too basic	3
the course is very interesting but the translation was very bad	3
the goodthe idea of having the lectures in a qa style two experts in continuous conversation about the topic has a potentialthe badthat potential is wasted on poorly planned lessons and course contentthe uglyinstructors run the swift code that is written during the lesson and they get a wrong result due to an error in the code they both agree that the result is weird but then continue to explain that this is how swift works in short they are misleading and confusing you on a topic you are trying to learnthis is of course unintentional but gives you a clue about how the quality check on lecture videos are taken care of details here httpswwwcourseraorglearnswiftprogrammingdiscussionsdbksjoeewnbbiwwhtgwq	1
perhaps its just that im not a part of the target audience of this course but i am deeply dissatisfied with it aside from a couple of rare interviews and old video records which admittedly were very interesting though too few i found nothing of value that cannot be learned by reading wikipedia or other easily accessible sources the course is pretty light on technical details and there could and perhaps should have been much more beyondthescenes content as well as references to specific documents and events in order to justify this courses existencein other words if you are a techie and are indeed interested in this topic chances are that you already know most of the material taught	0
too much peer and dealing with othersnot making me happy at all	0
overall the course was good it offered recorded sessions examples case studies control questions during lessons and a summary of key principles as extracted from the pmbok guide however it could benefit from having more of the former four items which should satisfy the need for explanations and application of knowledge the final exam had some questions repeating from previous quizzes which can also be avoided	3
although the course pace was very well suited for a total beginner i found the didactics of this course not so wellstructured the examples and starter codes caused quite some confusion and the underlying coding principles were not made very explicit ive finished an introductory python course from the university of toronto and found that course much better structured it gave me a level of understanding that i would probably not have reached by following the umich course alone	2
a bit short 	3
lectures are in hebrew english subtitles are in hebrew also completely useless unless you understand hebrew i am about to drop this class	0
unlike the other two lecturers in this course this modules lecture is very very bad i always felt like coming back and learning more with the other two lectures but with this one i had to force myself to complete the lessons first of all his english is bad sometimes you cant understand what he means even with subtitles he repeats many things through out the course and he tries to teach by asking questions all the time as a guy who takes and make his own notes i found it really difficult to put together a sentence he was saying it seems that nobody proof read his lectures before posting it on coursera i feel that it was done blindly and in a rushed way if possible can you please change the videos and also the script please make it more understandable	1
the peer review is a bad bad idea	0
really worthy for a financial individual	3
the course content is itself interesting but the lack of active mentors to provide guidance makes the course really difficult to learn so many unanswered questions on the discussion board and many confused students i am so glad i am not paying for this course	0
the course should have more programming assignments than just having simple quizzes and please update the language for swift 	2
erin barra is awesome really good course to get up to speed with ableton	4
big difference in difficulty between the mathheavy codec theory lectures and the other material which is quite basic not much to do with the dragonboard	1
could have more detail this course feels rushed and skims over a lot of things without detailed explanation the quizzes and peer assessments are poorly worded and confusing week  was excellent prof godefroid de callatays lectures about magic in islam were very well delivered and informative	1
the course was very informative but the slides were a little boring the content could have been more engaging sometimes the supplementary reading contained examples that could have been better explained in a video i would have appreciate a more comprehensive explanation of content on slides using markers or pointers sometimes i did not know where i needed to focus i hope the instructors create more videos for the same content this is may be because i am more of a visual or an engaged learner	2
can be extremely complicated with all of the unfamiliar names and id lose focus as a result i had a hard time keeping up id recommend pausing and returning another day if you lose focus	3
it is impossible to input solutions to quizzesexams  even when they are correct they are graded as wrong  a massive waste of time	0
extremely badly organized messy and technical	0
the interviews and course discussion are invaluable in this course	2
a very useful course full of everyday strategies for parents and teachers	3
excellent course for understanding studies and policies about terrorism its origins and the ways for understanding itterrorism is not about killing people its about fearing people toomaybe the course which based on the writes of mr bakker and one of his books could think us a commercial or promotional purposses but its a great really great course and way for understanding actually world were living and an excellent way for naming many things which happen all of usinformation is another fact power will release us from fearthanks	3
corporate hr focused conflict non resolution	0
lecture videos were fantastic instructor was amazing i have a big problem with the final project in week  the entire courses was focused on statistics yet the final project was focused on r i wish i had prior r knowledge before starting this course yet on the front page it says its a beginner specialization i would recommend learning r and ggplot before this course it will make the course a lot less frustrating	1
i think this course content is a bit dependent on thought processit changes with individuals	1
course content was great but i felt like the course left me hanging	2
the video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes as they are primarily theory and background the lectures will not however aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments the first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures the textbook or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignmentquiz there are so many disparate concepts that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in r how to properly import the data create the file structure the data and then perform some analysis these concepts are introduced throughout the course but never brought together in one complete project	0
the course was very generic and didnt teach that much sorry	1
this course is based on personal anecdotes and not facts many of the examples provided have been proven to be farces andor practical jokes	0
hello as previous ones this cousrse gives you basic understanding of the field and provide you with some additional materials for learning it depends on you whatever you study or dont speaking about me i would like to say thanks to the lecturer  althought the im not very interesting in any kind of research  thank you for your time and videos will review it once again to renew some ideas	2
great course but the pace and content can be improved on issuing of lecture slides in pdf would definitely help too	3
rather hard to understand	2
since there is a lot of math involved there should be some carefully written readings not only slides or phd thesis	0
too many animal mistreatment clips were shown also some gross misstatements of biologicalscientific truths and widely held facts humans cannot change the genome of any living creature dogs are wolves and always will be we have domesticated and bred for certain personality traits and characteristics done with your course	0
i really loved this course it was very diversified with different sources and mediums the course teaches not only the basics and the current situation but also goes beyond and introduces new technologies that will have profounf impact on digital marketing	4
good for students	3
an interesting supplement to my zen studies and practice while somewhat speculative in some parts largely due to fact that the brains complexity makes full understanding just a little out of reach even today the course is clearly built upon the foundations of rigorous science thousands of years of buddhist inquiry and common sense	3
great course with plenty of helpful tips	4
while the efforts of the coursemakers are greatly appreciated much could be done to refine the quality of the course many materials have broken links and the lack of character entry for some practice problems poses an issue as pinyin with tones is rather hard to type	1
this is a terrific course amazing preventionbut it does lack reading material that virginias full online course hasit would be nice to have a deeper engamente with the subjects	4
i have to admit that most of the videos confused more than they helped for most of the topics i simply went to khanacademy and got it easily there and i was asking myself why a topic was made so complicated i have the same issue with the next course i highly recommend to start visual explanations of what you want to achieve instead of throwing formulars at people and confuse them in khanacademy eg they do exactly this and you got the point and if you got the point the formular wasnt such a big thing anymore	1
i am a bit frustrated as the course is built around this amazing tool ibm bluemix that gave us high hopes of extracting super useful information but it is impossible to use the instructions seem outdated and not relevant to the actual tool there are lots of different sets that make it even more confusing and even after getting round a lot of the technical difficulties the tool doesnt seem to be very useful  i feel like i wasted a lot of time trying to get this to work with no results so far	1
the only option i had was to watch videos i could not submit quizzes which i completed unless i paidwhats even the point of having this course as part of courseravery disappointed shame on the university of maryland college park will stay away from this school	0
by far to introductory i think that this course should be an extension of the ios app development basics	1
excellent course with a perfect distribution looking forward to the next level	4
this course has some great information and guidance for delving into the social media landscape however the tools that come with the paid version are not easy to use or well explained for the lay person	1
there is a disconnect between what is taught and what is assigned	1
interesting course though it shows me how difficult is for me to understand everything i was difficult to follow it because the videos were too slow and sometimes i went away besides i wanted to download the transcriptions and sometimes it was imposible in the ipad near the end of the course i found out that i needed to close my session on the ipad to be able to have access to my course with my laptop it is true that i am learning english an maybe this is a hard course for me or maybe it is because i am not a philosopher even if i love them	3
a solid overview of accounting and finance for the nonfinancial professional i have  finance and accounting experience so i valued how broad this course was and i imagine its a good primer for more indepth courses	2
loved the tableau section and the instructor is a good communicator itd be great to have a whole course about this bi software	3
which practice	0
confusing assignment instructions were frustrating the lack of response to questions was disappointing and stressful i took the hci course in  that was precursor to this certificate program and it had a better flow and more organized	1
the material is useful but the execution is poor there were numerous quiz questions that i think they just had coded wrong on their end i think they need to carefully look at the questions with the most incorrect answers and ask themselves if theyve made a mistake also this might be the first time theyve tried making a peerreviewed project part of the course but they did a poor job they made it a homework assignment for week  but didnt make it clear that it wasnt due until the end of the course even though coursera sends you emails saying its due soon this caused a great deal of confusion some of the required readings also had broken links its odd nobody on their end checked those the week the material was taught they do provide a lot of useful supplemental material though often paywalled	1
doing this course first doesn t make you anticipate how difficult could this speciality in the next courses p	2
help me a lot in learning make me understand why my hard work doesnt paid off	4
it seemed like course material had little to do with the assignments teach us how to read alphabets and assignment is to write poetry big jump	2
this is probably one of the worst courses ive taken in courserajust an enumeration of whats on each version of the operative systems and few more information	0
i enjoyed the course and assignments greatly it really tested by creativity to design a game and laid out the basic elements of game design	4
its more a linux introducction not the expected from the title the content is good but no what was expeceted as it said interfacing i thought it was more about sensors and gpio programming	1
really great introduction to data science and the basic tools and concepts	4
good introduction to the base of web developpment	3
despite the pertinent content the way the instructor gave the classes could have been way more intuitive youll find videos on the web that can help you with the subjects covered and do a better job explaining the concepts disappointing	1
an amazing course taught by a more than amazing instructor all fundamental concepts explained superbly only one thing a bit of math derivations of various techniques would have helped	4
i enjoyed this course the topics the instructor the whole team and my very wonderful classmates thank you and please keep offering courses like these	4
it is basic knowledgehoweverit is useful to writing	3
good course for climate change learners	4
a very beginner level course aimed at starters who dont have much experience with data emphasis was on teaching data management with area of our interest in order to support this assignments didnt had clear objective i would have learnt a lot more through a course had they been more defined assignmentsnot a course if you are looking to be ready for data related interviews however this course will be okay if you are working on some other field and want data management as an extra skillset	1
completely useless just a number of boring videos of what you may possibly learn in data science specialization	0
not bad but not excellent	2
maybe too easy and too focused on the society more than on the brain itself enjoyed it though	2
really informative and interesting thank you coursera and professor sharpino for making this possible	3
good course for beginners in design thinking  collective intelligence methods very good and enjoyable videos	3
great course	4
very poor qualitythe teacher is talking and talking without saying anything concrete or giving some tools or practical suggestions	0
good for a beginner and useful as a refresh for someone who already knows html css and js basics	3
its good introduction but the assignment are rather poor not worth paying for it	0
thanks for all guidancevideo and other material was very good	4
average speakers and material	2
i was expecting an intro course for beginners this was not it id say this is more of a refresher course for intermediateadvanced users who are out of practice	1
i am very unhappy about the course certificate for the following reasons  it doesnt state what subjects have been covered it doesnt mention the hours of study involved the certificate has a worthless appearance in comparison i had a very good mooc statement of accomplishment from the university epfl which i can send to you if you are interested in making any improvements 	0
preety boring lots of code copying	1
this isnt a class its a workshopthank goodness for fee waivers i would have been so upset if i had spent my money on this course as someone who has taken coursera offerings in the past i cannot cosign the quality of this coursethis class seems to suffer from both a lack of structure and time i believe if the course was longer allowing for more space between unguided assignments the class would be a little better i understand that the instructor is barred by time constraints this is only a five week course and an optin one at that so i do relate to not wanting to inundate the class with reading assignment and lengthy lecturesthat said the guidance and lessons are lacking even if the class was longer i would still only give it  starsit appeared that the onus was on the mentors to provide answers for example the professor mentioned that our scripts are meant to feature half hour pilots this left many students writing dramas rather than comedies at a loss since they were planning for hour long pilots this again is partially an issue of the class being so short more time to review  the option to have longer pilots rather than only accepting half hour pilots in order to allow students to review five different submissions within three days since half hour dramas are unconventional i asked one of our mentors jz who is great for examplesthe responsibility should not be on the mentors to find out information like that should be included in the prompt if not discussed in depth then at least as a link or list of examples to research on your own if you have the time  desire to do so especially since the assignment boils down to break convention with no examples of successful scripts in this fashion in a class presumably allowing beginningeresgreenhorns to participate this is irresponsible and flawed teachingthe same goes of the hints that are periodically posted though again appreciated by mentors in the forums those definitions and explanations should be included in the meat of the class not as supplemental elements in all honesty if i didnt have prior experience with writing i oftentimes wouldnt have any idea what was being discussed by the professor and one trip through the forums will illustrate that i am not the only onethe assignments and due dates are oddly crunched together another time constraint issue i understand but the instructors videos seem to imply that we should be receiving feedback before proceeding each time maybe in a longer course that would work but here i didnt even receive written feedback initially so it would have been a mistake to wait for some to revise by before forging aheadif this class isnt going to provide a solid foundation to build on then it should be made clear upfront there is nothing wrong with an experience based  motivationfocused class but that aspect needs to be transparent we will not provide  teachingsreadings this isnt a class its a workshop its a makerspace at best i expected insight and some level of instructionin one of the lectures the instructor literally saysim not a big fan of some of the classic story structures defining in what must happen in each act or the problem the twist the resolution rising action denouement fine action etc he does not define these terms nor allude to them ever again these are key benchmarks in screenwriting definitions would be helpful for someone just starting out even if the instructor doesnt strictly want us to abide by them his students should leave the class more informed than when they cameunless youre lucky and receive a response from a mentor or someone with visible background in script writing the reviews dont amount to much because very few enrollees seem to know what is going on enough to provide a meaty assessment that is the fault of the course i think rather than my peers likewise the grading system here is atrocious because of it few people understand the foundation and thusly dont know how to format or structure so to then be graded on a purely pass or fail basis that looking through the forums many students werent even aware of until the first review grades rolled in is ridiculous and i am saying that as someone that scored  on both assignments that i did stay to complete so this is not a case of sour grapes but an observation of inefficiencyi understand that the class is based around active learning but for active learning to work and bear fruit students should be able to engage withanalyzesynthesizeevaluatebuild upon class content which necessitates actual meaningful content content beyond my fellow confused peers and  minute videos illustrating various ways of saying write something interesting and if it isnt interesting people wont care not exactly an astute observation that we couldnt glean anywhere but this coursehonestly my th edition copy of the screenwriters bible is five times more helpful than this course and it is about six years out of date	1
if you love to see a couple of entertaining movies about robots and some interesting concepts about them grab some popcorn and take this course because hey its about cool robotsif you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate i would not recommend to participate in this course the videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what i think this course should be about but there are a bunch of quizzes which are sometimes quite off the lecture material and you have to research a lot to get all of the questions right i managed to solve all quizzes in the end but it was some kind of a frustrating and discouraging process	1
videos were great but some of the assignments were unpractical and the tests were based on minuscule details	1
good introductory course it would have been nice to see some more deep mathematical demonstrations of the formulas at least as optional videos	2
i think that the course itself is very interesting and useful but unfortunately you have to purchase the course straight away to be able to do the tests	2
thank you for you time and for everything you didas an introduction i did not find that theres need to talk about the hosting and the other things related to this topic it would be better if the instructor went deeper into the html	1
this course is an outstanding introduction to web design technologies and tools as a backend developer i was looking for a course to refresh my knowledge of html and css and this course went far beyond what i had hoped to learn  even introducing me to some new tools as well as filling in a lot of the background of why things work the way they do my only criticism might be that the final weeks assignment was not very difficult and perhaps as a result didnt force me to really study the material otherwise i highly recommend this course and im looking forward to taking the angular course in this series thank you very much yaakov and johns hopkins	4
i dislike this course because i have to complete so many assignment in one week instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard sorry there are a number of times i have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand hence i even have to place myself in another slot because i could not finish the assignment please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn thank you	0
too basic	1
some lectures are just right for the public in general but most of them seem to be built from common sense theres where i wonder if the american people are so unliterate on food issues the quality of the visual material is also variable i am sure that including animation of more appealing graphics would be helpful to engage more people into the course another challenge would be to prepare more challenging content	0
felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration   month is not enough for this course i request the authors to make the course much more simpler	1
awesome course	4
why dont you open week and rest of the weeks  why the hell are you blocking my learning until 	0
useful primer on applying inclusive principles across spaces	3
this is certainly not a course for beginners the content of the course were rather complex and prior computer science knowledge is extremely helpful to finish this course it was a struggle for me to finish this course without any background in computer science however it was definitely challenging and gave me an insight on how two different disciplines can be connected in a single field of study the only improvement i could think of is if there were videos regarding the basic computer science knowledge that could have helped biologists such as myself perhaps giving an example on how things are done could be useful there were only a handful of examples and the examples only gave the answers but did not explain how to get that answer well enough	3
some interesting ideas but not entirely convinced by the concept of humility in this context is it really any more than simple openness to new ideas and the possibility of being wrong that is not really humble smacks at times of academic pretension you need to follow carefully what is being said  not a course to do while doing something else	2
its difficult to follow the content the way it is organized could be greatly improved	1
the videos for this course seemed to be  recap of the prior lesson and  restatement of what was learned some even duplicated their own content in the restatement the material covered was simply running through each of the menus in tableau again this material may be of use but would be better as a primer for the class rather than presented as useful paid content terribly disappointed	0
a very good encouragement to learn	4
uninspiring and boring	1
i have found this a deeply frustrating experience the main lecturer professor adam gearey clearly knows his subject well but is a terrible communicator his lectures are poorly constructed repetitious and sometimes confusing he seems at times to be delivering the lecture as a stream of consciousness rather than a properly prepared lecture as a result he sometimes misspeaks himself for example saying that murder trials are conducted in the high court rather than the crown court and these errors have not been picked up and corrected i am forced to wonder whether anybody in the university of london team bothered to quality check these videos these problems are compounded by the uncorrected subtitles and transcripts of the lectures obviously done by somebody with no understanding of the subject it is also frustrating that when i raised these concerns in the weekly discussion forum i received replies from a volunteer moderator which were so badly written as to be almost unintelligible this moderator made no attempt to enter into constructive discussion but told me that you cannot say our professor is wrong because you disagree with him and that i should read the sentence properly in other words no criticism however constructive can be tolerated even some of the questions in the quizzes are carelessly constructed for example the correct answer to q in the final quiz uses the word allowed which implies an element of discretion instead of required which would have properly reflected the provision in question s hra   the authority could not have acted differently  all in all the presentation of this course falls far short of the academic standards i expected from a university with londons reputation	0
good cource	3
after  great courses in this specialization this one was disappointing the content just isnt explained well in the videos the labs were fine im sorry but the course seemed rushed and it isnt great marketing for the bayesian approach as a consequence i am now not sure if i want to do the capstone	2
when the instructor for the course expresses amazement at the level of difficulty people are expressing in the forums that tells you a lot about how out of touch he is with what he is teaching and what is really required prerequisite knowledgethere is minimal actual instruction in excelmost often concepts are taught much like khan academy on a digital blackboard nothing inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word excel in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually demonstrate using excel nope not hereif youve never heard of linear regression or bayes theorem dont bother with this course honestly while those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple  minute video wont clear the fogyou absolutely will not master data analysis with this course ive used excel for over  years daily and to have the gall to say your course will master something with a few videos is misleading and deceptiveif it wasnt for the tamentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failureif youre wanting to jump on the data analysis scientist bandwagon look elsewhere ie edx has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with peoples impression of actually using excel in that contextnow having bashed the course i do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual but i feel hes been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those whove been in school continuously and still have algebra stats fresh in their minds vs those who need to brush away the cobwebs the course in more on the level of a  and in certain parts  level but not 	0
great introduction to lots of different blended learning styles and tons of resources for further study	3
well structured course	4
useful and inspiring	4
the accents of the instructors make it difficult to understand the material	0
interesting course	2
i have done the first  parts and i am half way through the rd and i am finding some of the information to be inaccurate according to the nhs in the uk condom failure rate is  not  as stated in this course it also seems to put a bit too much emphasis on abstinence i would recommend every one taking this course to do some further research into contraception and find out more accurate information	2
it is great only having problems with finding quizzes and the app the rest is what i was in need of	3
a really good introduction to the course well explained good videos i only wish i could have read the extra materials too only one complaint very minor  i live in colombia and found a couple of references to columbia in the materials but overall super	4
a great introductory course providing the theory and practice for understand and live positive psychology	4
again another awesome course really recommend it to people who are interested in getting a grasp of css and coding handson	3
i hope this course can be more systematic in terms of the structure on the concepts and lecturers	1
complex concepts eg regression which cannot be taught in such a short course format i know from extensive prior training are taught here in an arcane way i dont know how students without prior knowledge on these topics eg regression roc curve analysis could possibly understand this when taught this waycourse is also in an early draft mode with plenty of mistakes in the videosslides the course and specialization really tarnishes  instead of enhancing  this institutions outside image and reputationreally a deception sorry i took this class and specialization a complete waste of my time and money the initial presentation was misleading and i have found online many people sharing the same feeling	0
very boring	0
great sometimes i wondered why the true statistical terms  like factor analysis  were never mentioned	3
it is overall an ok course samiliarly as a programming intro class imo the quality range from the project design and content originzation is no where close to the iipp offered by rice i do not enjoy this course as much as i did in iippif you are just interested in getting touch with programming instead of learning java like i go to take iippi think the first week should appear later probably should be swapped with week  or even  the first week class was just super confusing without knowing the basic concept like vairable type declearation and the connection between different methodsgood luck	2
it is a useful course to improve our mail writing skills these skills are very important in the business society	3
a few of the programming projects were a bit tedious if youre not passionate about games like tic tac toe its hard to maintain focus  i love the teaching however very well done as usual	2
again excellent foundation course it gives you teh tools and the	4
i am really unhappy with this course coming to r with some background in statistics and sql but lacking programming experience i assumed this would be an introduction the material in the lectures is straightforward enough and the swirl exercises are easy to get through and informative but the assignments are without exception based on writing functions in r with basically zero experience having no background or frame of reference for best practices in syntax logic etc and very little information in the lectures or supplementary material to help i found these to be almost impossible to completefurthermore theres no mechanism or provision in the course to review the assignments after theyre submitted so not only did i not feel like i was doing the work correctly i cant get feedback and the lecturer doesnt break down the rationale behind the assignment and how he would have done it or why in addition the assignments bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material so i would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through swirl exercises only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps i felt i had taken in my overall competence with the language and materiali dont doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff but this class should be reserved for advanced learners only or maybe be broken up into two courses i feel like i wasted 	0
repetitive content with other moma courses modern artidea duh not gonna pay  for this 	0
very interesting course	4
good introduction to the galaxy tool however the final project was too difficult for what was given in the lectures i spent  of the time i spent on the course doing only the final project it was too difficult and unfair i think a way to improve the final project might be to make easier a little bit and give exclusive lectures to help students to do the final project	0
this course change my life	4
good approach for beginners	3
the material is ok but the grading is terrible most of the grades are for peer reviews which depending on other students may never be completed particularly if your first try isnt perfect and you need to resubmit i would not pay for the course until i had passed peer review as odds are you never will	1
not good weak lecturer repeats himself endlessly waste of time	0
great course everyone should do	4
genearlly it helps but i hope it would be much better if you have chances to review resume from each other and receive feedback thank you	2
firstly an extraordinary course thats offered for free  my heartfelt gratitude to prof ng	3
i really learned alot from this course and it will help me stay on task in my school work and help guide me in a more effective way to manage my personal goals and responsibilities i highly recommend this course	4
i loved the course very clearly step by step i could review my current situation and the tips that were given were clean ethical ways of handling people we find difficult to deal with in life it was more like a self empowerment courseboth the facilitators were awesome people i learnt to relate with within  weeks time their expertise and experience showed in each of their classes the examples and experiments used were eye openers and very interesting i watched and heard them more than oncei enjoyed the course thoroughly thank you	4
hii was looking for a good introduction course to food and nutrition and alas this is not iti knew  of the things discussed in this course and i was expecting more but all i got was very basic advices eat less dont eat crap etc all with videoclips and music which got annoying really quickdisappointingtake care	0
it felt few content i think there could be more content in this course though i have to say i learn new stuff but i which it had more content to learn more	2
this is absolutely not for beginners there is no way you can possibly do this class in under  hours a week the presentations are sloppy and vague there is absolutely no support unless you count snark from the aids who check into the message boards once and a while to tell you your question is stupid this woman chatters on way to fast and if you use the slower speed setting on the videos it crashes every time i am not happy that i wasted money on this class it offers nothing to prepare you to actually do any real life html coding i highly recommend either purchasing a book to learn on your own or take a class elsewhere the coursera platform is garbage the app crashes and it doesnt seem to cooperate well with safari so i have to lug around my laptop in order to get through this nonsense	1
the lessons were too long in duration and i was really bored because the teaching didnt have anything engaging me to be more eager to listen and all the slides were with the same background and design and there were no pictures or animation or fun stuff to create some kind of diversity in the progress of the course	1
good allround course with both theoretical and practical parts because you now can buy a rather expansive certificate from taking the course the quizes are no longer available which is a shame	2
i love the enthusiasm of the professor and the material he covered this would be very good for complete beginner to programming but may make you feel little slow for people migrating from other languages like cc etcoverall i enjoyed the course thanks	3
a submission too complicate to learn chinesethree submission is too reasonable	1
the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologiesstrongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations	2
this is a required course in the data science specialization if youre planning to take that specialization you should start with this course if not you shouldnt bother  theres not much here	2
this course is less informative and systematic than i expected although some time management tools are provided the course is in general loose rather practical	1
the course is a little easier for professions	3
honestly i find it very hard to recommend this course to anyone first of all lets note that the course covers quite more advanced topics than the previous  courses in the specialization so some extra difficulty is to be expected however the main problem i encountered was with the video lectures themselves particularly during the rd and th week of the course the instructor does a very rushed job at explaining everything constantly giving us tons of information and jargon that is not previously mentioned and even the examples fail to give us insight at what we need to do and whyother than the lectures no external material is given to help us decipher what the professors are saying other than a few wikipedia links im not saying that each course should be accompanied by an ebook but honestly if i wanted to learn about bayesian statistics from wikipedia i could have well skipped this classthe main reason im giving  stars to the course instead of  is the labs and the quizzes even though they could use some polishing too especially the final lab they are indeed very helpful and do a much better job at clarifying the concepts presentedall in all i feel that if you want to learn about bayesian statistics you should look for another course andor save your money and get yourselves a good textbook	1
articlute and engaging instructor nice and easy introduction for assignments awesome course	3
content was enjoyable and accessible videos helped a lot transcriptions were pretty poor and there are a few of bugs here and there in the code videos and slides however in the end the difficulty and depth of the course is great for the committed student youll walk away with a lot of practical knowledge if you take notes	3
it was i nice course but it would have been better start building an app from scratch in the practice sections	3
the pronunciation of the lectors is more than awful their english is quite unsuitable for video lectures so i quit the course it is just a torture listening to them	0
okay course techniques and content are a bit too traditional	1
the concepts are good but the delivery is quite dry very hard to pass the quizes as there are no analogies or examples in the videos  just theory i did not enjoy this course as much as i did the first two in the programme	1
unfortunately i can not deal with the professors voicethe content is good	2
good start looking to dig in more as i already have a background in stats data analysis and data viz	3

once again a great add on to the previous course things are starting to get nice and icky with methods and properties also some interesting concepts well done with the training material 	4
great introduce really helpful thank you	4
content of the course is great but if you get stuck in a problem no one responds or guides you for practice purpose just take the free version paid version is not worth taking as you will not get any additional guidance or support to do assignments when stuck	0
there is not enough exercise	2
overall a good course content however more shorter examples would have helped retain the content better	3
the material is not mature yet some things were not tested by the teacher before being part of the course and do not actually work questions asked on the forums about it got no answers before the end of the course	0
this course in informative but not very and it is rather boring	2
clear and easy to follow despite a challenging course	4
one of the best courses available	4
good as a very simple overview this is more high school level than college level but if that is what you are looking for then worth the small investment of time and effort it will take	3
the virtual machine experiment was very difficult to implement because the instructors format did not allowenough detailed instruction specific to each os platform regardless students did learn how to use vmware to make a virtual cloud on a home network and control it via smartphone	1
this course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good the instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible rd pengs courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum simple language having a background in theoretical physics and computer science this duality in this course is very confusing for me also i do not need to see a tiny grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos	1
this was a good course but much more ambitious than the description or name suggests i had to watch the videos at  speed in order to figure out what was actually said as i have never heard any korean before i used the quizlet flashcards and some youtube videos in order to learn the material as the lecture notes were not always very helpful so in all a good course if you can access some supplementary activities in fact adding the quizlet flashcards to the lesson either before the lecture or before the quiz would be helpful for future students i plan to take the class again in order to master the material	2
nice course there is only one suggestion i want to send you the video is so short that we can not learn the pandas more in the course so i hope you can provide more detailed videos thanks	3
its amazing and thanks to maths  english professors who used similar techniques when i was  which helped a lot in my further career	3
excellent course highly recommended one of the very rare courses i will take again as both the material and teacher were really good	4
sad to know that i need to pay inorder to get a online certificate	2
very good course with very nice instructors this course is an oportunity for who wants to see theory and practice in the same time the examples and the implementation in hardware of principles studied in the course is awesome for those who want to have experience with mobile robotics i liked it a lot	4
its an excellent course and i would recommend it to everyonethank you very much	4
this course was even better than the previous course of the specialization it explains historical technical part of the typography and assignments were very well related well designed course	4
not a bad overview but overall far too shallow to be of significant worth on its own	2
course lectures are good but many quiz questions are out of syllabus sorry i am not satisfied	1
it is a good introductory course but it could be optional for people with some experience in the field as it is very basic	2
great class i recommend for everyone	4
the old version was more interesting	2
i like this course it is very easy because of the trainer	2
this course provides very nice and useful tools for data analysis	3
good informative course the course should cover a little bit of change management concept well designed and planned	3
a very well designed starter course for learning the basics of project management right thanks 	4
poor presentation of topics i dont recommend	1
not much information for people who already work in related projects	2
it is good  but some items needs to be illustrated in more details  a great thing of this course is that it gives a lot of practice exercises	2
very useful course	3
the course is really good because the teacher is great but there are some errors in subtitles and even in some exercises	3
this course in the specialization was really helpful to me in shaping my service prototype by applying the wizard of oz move thank you so much coursera and wharton	3
this is as good a ciurse as i have had including all my live courses as an undergraduate and through my doctorate this man really knows how to teach a complex course	4
i learned a lot from this course	4
a waste of time	0
it is not well done as the previous courses the quizzes usually do not concern the topic of the lessons or better the lessons do not help in anyway to solve the problems	0
speakers sound so monotone and dry that they leave an unenthusiastic impression of an incredibly fascinating subject some video lectures and writings are so unnecessarily verbose they cloud what is being taught frustratingly fought my way through the lessons and failed to clearly retain what i was trying to learn from prof germano all apologies to the professor for any harshness and i may try again one day but not now	1
thanks	3
so far topnotch	4
great introduction to interactive plotting mapping and shiny deeper examples would be helpful	3
too qualitative too much theory narrativeneeds more specific examples of how numbers are manipulated for eg in financial statement fraud perhaps show real data on how outlier transactions are spotted	1
the course was informative and engaging however the process of receiving peer reviews on exercises was extremely frustrating and detracted from my overall satisfaction with the course many people ignored the grading criteria and gave me a lower score than was warranted despite having answered the questions fully referencing lecture material and even including additional information sources all of which was referenced with links i know that i am not alone in this experience as these types of comments come up frequently in the forum posts since there is no recourse for a poor grade other than to resubmit an exercise to a new cohort of peers and hope that they are more fairly critiqued this grading process puts students at the mercy of peers who either do not understand or do not care about the instructions for grading each others work	2
a very nice and fulfilling course highly recommend	4
very interesting class with good example and lots to learn	4
the course and presentations were very informational and good i enjoyed that aspect i would have rated the course  star based on that the reason for the low rating was the th module and the fact that i felt very ill prepared for the syntax of creating all the operations in spark building out the jupiter notebook we really did not cover much of that and it was quite punishing to search the web and sources to make things work even the instructions to export the csv file were misleading at best i have a full time job and a family i am not some young undergraduate with copious amounts of time to waste while i am not opposed to some searching of other sources i would like to have more of the useful information taught so that it is not so much of a burden i believe that if you are going to test people on something you should at least cover it in some sense	1
unfortunately i think the level for this course is very low and not worth paying for it has a very local perspective of logistics not involving international logistics but only us operations theres no communication with the professor or assistants so its basically watching a few very short videos explaining general concepts that apply only to certain types of operationsthe assignments are very vague with no requirements or restrictions provided basically anyone can write anything and as long as you follow the requested format it will be graded ok grading is not based content and therefore theres no way to know whether youre learning and applying the concepts properly or notwouldnt recommend paying for it	0
good introduction good to learn the way it works	3
too much peer rating too little hard information	0
not enough supporti	0
these two stars go to the instructor in week  i left the course after week  because i couldnt tolerate the accents of the instructors i got frustrated starting from week  where i have to reread the subtitles to understand the material please let someone who can speak english fluently teach the course please the course goes kinds of fast this is first course of the specialization and it quickly jumps to greedy algorithm really in general algorithm course it is usually taught late	1
a nice introduction to the three plotting systems in r the second part is devoted to clustering but it is not detailed enough to be really useful	2
could have utilized video lectures more questions on final exam did not seem to relate to materials covered in course course seems to just comprise  or  minute long video lectures and then direct students to vast amounts of online reading material	1
the course was good i enjoyed it the biggest problem was the unmoderated participation of at least one other student this particular student drove the discussion of assignments leaving little room for others to explore ask and answer questions as far as i know the student was not a mentorta but it would have been most helpful for staff to weigh in on some of the students post i really believe the student was feeding hisher ego	2
good but abit brief	3
not a fan of this course reasons the subject material is presented in a dry manner too much talking and jargon  i find it repetitive and boring i have to play it at least x in order to get through the material and try and stay engaged but i still have a hard time paying attention seriously so boring there is a high degree of subjectivity in grading essays peer reviewsthis course can benefit from clearer introduction of concepts using pictures and animations as well as cutting out the repetitiveness and the assault of the jargonaut a better approach to grading that places importance on concepts instead of key words jargon	0

this is a good java tutorial httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtbwxeeglistpleebfcbi followed two videos and im learning in my wayi left the course because the ammount of time required was too high for example for one part of an exercise i spent a total of  hours distributed in  days for the other part of the exercise i spent  hour also in the part one the last exercise was tremendouly difficult for begginers and for someone my case that know one languageyou are making people hate java this is not for begginers i have to say that the part of codepen and html was greatfortunatelly i didnt pay but i think that paying for this course is a waste of money i had a good experience in other coursera programming course an introduction to interactive programming in python of rice unviersity the examples were awesome and the tests were reasonable quite the opposite to this coursealso eclipse is so much better than bluej in many ways also into learningand theres more things that must be improved but no time and no moneyim very dissapointed to this course and duke univeristy	0
this course is amazing  good to help how learn better to motivate and do understand some concepts i loved it and would like to do other times thank you a lot	4
 assumptions about the student are not clear before starting the courseinstructor examples are not practical in all contextsjump to dijkstra in very second week without clarity on major c concepts and examples is too much an expectation from the student switching from c to c for the first timeconfusion with deadline for assignmentstoo many lectures during later week courses as if the effort is to crunch everything in that week and complete the courseif its spaced properly with examples and problems over few more weeks it would help	1

not much usefull to the reality	2
it must be taught by someone who can speak english clearly sorry but i couldnt understand what mercedes paniccia spoke which made the course even more difficult to understand there are subtitles but its not possible for everyone to put that much effort this issue must be taken seriously to make this mooc much better	0
great course although last lesson about splay trees explanation is too fast and basic for me to understand	3
whilst the material in the course is fine although repetitious in places the pacing is fairly poorultimately there are three things covered by this course a brief overview of remote sensing handson raster classification and handson work with model builder work using hydrology as an example framework these then combine into the final submitted assignment many of the remaining lecture topics dont particularly link in to anything youll be doing and are just for interests sake also a lot of time is spent on the more intuitive aspects of model builder but little to none is allotted to troubleshooting and the less intuitive aspects for example how to incorporate variables throughout a model or other issues with generalising a custom tool built within model builderif taking the course be aware that the final submitted assignment requires formulating your own research question and unless youre already working in the field can necessitate a significant amount of literature review for even the given example research questions the gap in expectations and assistance is more of a chasmunless you have the better part of a week free to commit to the course it is advised that you skip ahead to the final assignment immediately and spread it over the full four weeks spending the first week formulating the question the second producing the classified raster and the third the model builder model including any research necessary for this step this gives the last week to produce products for submission or continue the work from the third weekhopefully in upcoming repeat sessions of the course pacing will be improved the grading rubric provided before final submission for the sake of transparency and clarity and a little more guidance and actual feedback available in the forums which are largely deserted at this point	2
very good course and gives a lot of information to apply in countries in development	4
links to  year old articles websites and ted talks that can be found on google dont really constitute a course to me sorry	1
absolutely great course i learned a lot	4
very basic	1
this course is extremely basic it took me about four hours to complete the entire course minus the peer reviewed assignment since i audited this wouldnt be an issue in and of itself but there were quite a number of issues with the presentation from questions appearing in the wrong video to badly worded and misleading questions its as if the course material was quickly thrown together and not reviewed or tested overall there is some good info in it if you have no background in accounting and no idea what a balance sheet is but if youre looking for insight into interpreting balance sheets this is not the class for you	2
the course material is interesting  but the assignments rely heavily on reviewing the work of other students which severely detracts from the course if i wished to grade other peoples coursework i would have pursued a career in academia instead of becoming a research scientist	0
very good place to learn very important tools like dyplr and tidyr to access and clean from several formats	3
found the assignments were very loosely aligned with the lecture material and had poorly formed problems in placeslectures were reasonably good but not quite up to the standard set with other u of w data science courses or other university data science  machine learning courses i have taken	2
very shallow overview not really a full course id say	1
impossible to navigate to the course material took my payment but insists on another payment before it will let me submit an assignment very frustrating i am about to request a refund	0
pretty good but expected more of helping writing own programs	2
the slide set is too brief was expecting more details with examples  visuals	2
alas after only  minutes of the first video i am reminded that this instructor does not gear his lectures to the true beginners among us he speaks much more for an audience of grad students i do want to complete this specialization so i will try again perhaps after learning more  about statistics and r and who knows what else i fought my way through the first three courses but now im going to work smarter by finding other ways to acquire this knowledge then return to him maybe this course should be labelled intermediate and statistics should be listed as a prerequisite i think since i dont know what it is that i dont know i am making a guess as to the missing piece of the puzzle	1
very basic overview outdated in some way when it comes eg on ar feature extraction methods	0
amazing course amazing prof andrew ng	4
really liked this course great balance of theory and putting it to practice on current issues at work got such great input from other people in the course on the first two assignments especially  very insightful and actionable	3
if you are considering this specialization i would recommend the andrew ng course instead and the main reason is that it isnt depend on proprietary ml framework despite the good lectures the assignments dont help you develop the knowledge required for ml developer roletaking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery from summer  to summer  finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled im completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience	0
very nice time spent with an talented person highly recommend	3
definitely could be more systematic and clear sample spreadsheets could be improved in many ways and any attention to detail would do this course much good tests and quizzes also could benefit a lot with a revisecurrently plenty of confusion with phrases and wording	1
the course lecture was ok swirl was pretty good the assignment was confusing and the instructions were not very clear	2
this was my least favourite course in the the creative writing specialisation i learnt a bit about creating characters but i found the lessons bland and the assignments difficult to understand	1
great content mixing lectures articles and videos gave several perspective on the topics and made the content more interesting peer reviews of papers varied drastically based on the reviewer so may not be the best way for grading	3
exercises could be more complete and some are outdated for latest r giving slightly different results	2
i think with more listen exercises this course will be better and the length of the videos too short	1
great courseincisive and insightful	4
its theoreticalno practical project to do	1
a lot of useful information	3
pretty simple stuff  but wouldve been better if there was actually something we worked on in a group or an actual project to plan or gantt chart to create	2
was boring nothing interesting here	1
great content overall some of the lectures are now a bit out of date but the information is still technically accurate id appreciate a newer version of the lectures most of which were created in  the introductory remarks from the professor each week have been updated somewhatid also appreciate the full videos for each lecture some of the lecture videos are cut off quite extensively a video may say its  minutes in length but the professors lecture hasnt ended and students end up wandering whether the lecture has actually ended in most cases as my classmates and i have found the lecture was not posted in full and we have to go to youtube to get the full lectureother than these two smaller issues the content and lectures are good quality and a reasonable length for each week i learned a lot from this course that will help me better understand the world of banking and finance in particular	3
i am an engineer with no background in law but found it rather easy to follow prof gearey as he neatly unravelled the hidden logic of a complex amorphous subject the lectures build on the topic from first principles and the quizzes are well designed i am hooked on the subject and am ready to tackle some of the more difficult subjects	3
too easy little content can pass course easily without watching any of the videos	0
so exciting coursethank you very	4
some good points spends a lot of time on selfadvertisement takes a lot of time to get to the point	1
the content was inconsistently delivered and the topics disorganized the content was excellent although a bit repetitive at the end	2
the quiz feedbacks are empty this is not good	0
interesting content well structure lessons but too easy assesments	2
i was expecting much more from a stanford or coursera course lack of scientific evidence processed foods have become an easy villain among many people and the idea that processed foods are dangerous to our health and the responsible for all our problems is a mistake very disappointing	0
i wouldnt pay  dlls for this course nor the other courses within this specialization this one contains quite a lot of errors theres a lack of domain of the matter by the instructor and some concepts are poorly explain and incorrectly defined its quite a shame that this course is in behalf the umans name  hope this course gets upgraded	0
the course is very well planned and the information about the wc validator is very good it helps me a lot to improve my code and make it perfect almost thanks and keep up the good work	4
the course name is very misleading while overall it is not a bad course i believe a lot of people come here expecting very different material lets just put it this way mastering data analysis mostly things to do with probability with occasional use of excel do not expect to learn anything new in excel	1
excellent course very interesting and fun	4
this course offers valuable information on the different aspects of construction project managment the only critic i have is that the instructionsgrading rubric for the assignments are terribly vague the assignment starts with a simple example in the videos which the student can reasonably replicate and create their own version the problem starts when you begin the peerassignment grading and realize the grading points are painfully specific now you have to go back and redo your homework assignment after you learned what was really expected from the student this wouldnt be an issue except that your second draft may not get graded if all of the students are done grading plus its annoying to have to redo work that you could have done right the first time but the guidelines were unclear	2
the teacher explains concepts very well really worth the time to go over the lectures several timesthe programming assignments however lack instructions and the online judgement system has some strange requests which are not illustrated in the instruction you have to guess what the assignment is about each timeoverall very good lectures but poor assignments	2
i found difficult to navigate within the course and the style of the course is not very modern i felt difficult to follow the whole program which might be also linked to my level of english that might not have been good enough considering the technical vocabulary used in the program however some interesting and very concrete tips to learn	1
great course useful stressfree exercises	4
short but jam packed with stuff you need to know in order to get working with databases the ending lesson was a little disappointing as we werent tested on how to do some of the suggested projects that the teacher was talking about and instead only had to download and run a program on our computer however this class equips you with the knowledge to get a start in data science and database engineering as well as good practice and better understanding of how to use python	3
the course is perfect  if my friends need this kind of classes  i would recommend this one but not efriends around me	3
too basic not enough coverage of topics discussed	2
very interesting overview of wind energy not detailed just an overview	3
it is a good course but im not sure its simple enough for beginners  it doesnt teach you all the steps you need to know	2
there is no doubt that coursera platform is the best education in the worldbut i want to learn digital marketing and this capstone needs to experience in the digital marketing not less than  yearsi wish there are a path or templates to work and learn such as the capstone project of specialization in marketing social mediathere is lack of information and data and the previous five courses is insufficient for professional project like this capstonethe first course marketing in the digital world was really the best course in courseraand this course is really the worst course in courseraand unhelpful and i did not learn anything from this course only gather information from various sources to pass assignment	0
a let down and not up to par with other courses in the serieshuge amount of time is wasted bsically repeating that the api is close to scala collections the huge amout of time is wasted again on very simple dataframe apis including several slides presenting the show function allow me to repeat  several slides presenting the show functionfinally the assignments are unimaginative and mechanical the desciption is really confuse and most of the time is spend trying to chase small differences away to please the graderthe sole part of the course that seemed interesting was the shuffling one that was unfourtunately ignored on the assignmentsnot related to the course but to spark what utter mess are dataframes and datasets filled with boilerplate type conversions and runtime erros i shy away in disgust form this untyped ideunfriendly monstruosity	1
very interesting and exciting to learn more strategies	4
elementary school level program not college or university	0
nice course yet more hands on work was expected	2
this is way too esoteric the content was delivered way too fast for me to keep up and process it this needs to be taught with more frequent hands on examples im also not sure why if auditing we cant submit and see how were doing on the learning i have no way to evaluate if im picking up the concepts or not which is a struggle overall i would not recommend this course for r beginners i would look elsewhere	0
the videos are fine but its simply terrible to force people to pay to be able to do the quizzes there was no such a thing in the first two courses by the way i gave high rates for both it is ok to pay for the verified certificate however disabling the functions in the course is a wrong way to earn money because people who want to learn the course might not necessarily want the certificate and this is unfair to them because it limits the resources available this whole specialization thing starts to make me feel like you guys are in urgent need of money rather benefiting the community remember there are tons of free resources on the internet and this only undermines your strengths you will lose tons of potential fans stop being seemingly arrogant	0
this was really a very great experience to have this course i really had a good time and interest while learning the things the best part of all these courses are that its very interesting and knowledge feeding	3
more detailed insight of topics is required is what i felt on the whole a great resource to the student community who want to start their microcontroller exploration through arduino	2
the course do not match its price at all it is catastrofically sketchy first time while using coursera i am so much unsatisfied with some course	0
its good for the starters but touches very few and very basic concepts no offense but the professor could have made it much more interaction by making the better slights he would just read values without even using markers	1
 for this duh	0
if you are considering this specialization i would recommend the andrew ng course instead and the main reason is that it isnt depend on proprietary ml framework despite the good lectures the assignments dont help you develop the knowledge required for ml developer roletaking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery from summer  to summer  finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled im completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience	0
if there had been a working autograder for the last final project this course would have been worth it somehowwhat does that mean the lectures provided valuable information the quizzes generally made sense in relation to the lectures learning how to code wasnt really possiblewhy is that there is only one programming assignment the autograder doesnt give any feedback at all why resp where things go wrong thats everything but good style for software as well as for learning code snippets cant be tested individually thats very bad behavior in programming at the end working code that meets the teached rules is marked as wrong you are lost without any clueso probably you can learn something unfortunately you cant possibly finish the course with a feeling of success	1
few useful information	1
not worth wasting your time over they state that which is blatantly obvious and provide little insight into human factors of security	0
short easy and practical advice on how to work efficiently	3
it is ok and not as good as the marketing class from warton	2
just an introduction not so great	2
this course is too short	1
the course was good enough to cover all the basic of interfacing with an arudino and the tutor has done a good job at helping with the basic as well i would like to thankyou for this good course	3
useless quiz and not enough challenge codingdatacamp or codeacademy do a better jobonly for absolute beginnersothers please try something else you will waste your time learning nothing	1
boring	0
excellent way of teachingcrystal clear teaching of conceptsexcellent use of models and providing good practice problems side by side	4
appreciate this course a lot it was crisp and to the point major focus was on using design thinking toolthe only downside was the lack of reference material course should include the slides that were presented in the video as well as some additional reading material available for free	2
seems light on material professor misses no opportunity to pitch his book	1
i wouldnt recommend this course to my worst enemy there is  commitment from the ta and mentor staff after  weeks of course not a single reply from any of them in the forumsto make matters worse the material is very superficial and lacking the biggest proof of that is that each module is composed of about  videos of  minutes each how can you learn anything in  minutes the topics are so complex there is simply no way to convey their message in just about  minutes i had to search a lot outside of this course to grasp something of the topics covered actually i found way better explained videos on youtube for freethe assignments of this course are poorly developed and dont reflect what is discussed in the videos well i repeat myself the study material was very lacking and consequently not enough for the assignments themselves i had to spend days coding debugging and reverse engineering the assignment files to finally be able to pass because they were wrong they were incomplete and had wrong information this is not a reverse engineering course i shouldnt need to do that anyway i did it because there was also no help from any ta to guide me in the right directionlong story short you are way better off checking the syllabus of this course and checking videos on youtube to learn about them youll learn way more than with this money grabber course	0
thank you for the course the professors explain things with great enthusiasm and artistry the main topic of the course  breaking ciphers is very interesting for me because of this interest i was completely involved into the coursethank you again	3
project description versus requirements were terrible not sure if the new coursera format played a role in the issues or not quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers dont align to the results of the latest tools they have you use if the first class or three in the series was like this i wouldnt have taken the courses	0
poor video lessons the course is sustained by the reading material alone	1
a good basic introduction to photography some nice resources are shared including books and web sites	3
great course for java developers to start learning functional programming concepts	4
for such a terrible course to then change payment terms without my authorisation take  from my account without telling me clearly amongst all the other junk mail coursera have a lot to answer for and this specialisation is not even worth wasting your time if it was freetaught without purpose meaningless instructions given to copy without regard of the bigger picture	0
i am very excited about this particular assignment  great instructors means great instructions 	3
pretty hard to keep track but the content was goodi probably need to be a bit more focussed next time	1
this course starts off interesting and then just gets absurd a huge chunk of the genetic part has activities where you have to translate large genetic sequences by hand if you dont have access to a printer trying to break up genetic codes into letter codons and translating them is an exercise in frustration plus the sequences are not even easily formatted for printing as they are all images so you cant even just copy them into an editor and break up the sequencesthis was only the second course i dropped on cousera	0
requires matlab in my view a university should not be promoting a proprietary product there have been other cousera courses which used octave the freesoftware implementation of the programming language implemented by matlabi have seen no good reason why octave should not have been used for this course	0
the comparaison between chinese and western culture was really useful it was a nice overview but it would also have been interesting to get information at least some ints about the long and fascinating chinese history more historical context would be appreciated	2
very interesting course that provides a comprehensive yet accessible account of the global financial crisis as well as of its causes and consequences both prof metrick and mr geithner do a great job in explaining the materials using clear slides and easily understandable graphics and figures the course setup is also clear and can easily be completed the quizzes offer a good opportunity to keep track of the course contents maybe extend them to  questions instead of just  perhaps a comprehensive final exam reviewing the materials of all prior weeks would be sensible as one might have forgotten what topics were discussed in week  or  while learning the contents of week 	3
this course is a challenging into to ableton live it is well worth the time for even experienced producers who are new to ableton live i first got ableton live in november  it is now january  and i feel like i have come a long way thanks to this course	4
some interesting content if you are interested in serious games	3
good course with well explained topics	2
i was quite satisfied with the content of this course	3
horrible quiz questions i found the distractors to be too similar to the answer what is the point in having  possible correct answers	1
this course is not worth taking especially if you have to pay for it it is boring and you hardly learn anything do not take this class it is not worth your money	0
that was a great introduction to bootstrap  and a big plus for introducing bower and npm however it is still recommended to code a serious webpage yourself after finishing this course to solidify the elusive knowledge	4
professor is not engaging at all presentation skills are poor	0
the best class at all	4
poorly organized course the lectures seemed to jump around from one point to another in some cases way too much detail in others not nearly enoughthe subtitles have so many errors that they are virtually useless	0
this course is very abstract and i find myself rushing through the videos to get to the practicequiz so that i can trial and error my way through the project hoping for the best neither am i excited about starting the lesson each week because there is no real world problemor data set im continuously practicing from the lessons are essentially a reference guide and not a useful approach for teaching if i wanted a reference guide id just pick up one of the various handbooksbooks on the markets that list r codes and their functions a better way to teachpresent this course is by infusing actual real world examples or cases throughout the lessons instead of just listing a function and talking through its corresponding activityresponse ideally the real world example would be introduced in the first lesson in week  and that data set would be used throughout the courses to apply and practice newly introduced functions teaching from this perspective would likely make the concepts much easier to grasp and importantly retain the lessons as they are currently presented encourage rote memorization and rob the students of actually applying the conceptscode taughtalso i love the idea of this specialization however i think the professors need to work more closely with online instructional designers to make the entire series more palatable for online learning it very much feels as if they have adapted a traditional course on their own without the help of professionals who are skilled at designing online courses if the aforementioned is the case the professors should be commended for their efforts but there is definitely more work to be done to make this an engaging course id recommendps  i am taking notes and i have some experience with stata so this type of codinganaylsis is not unfamiliar to me i can only imagine how novices may take to the lessons	1
the course is very helpful not only for child nutrition but personal nutrition as well the course content was very interesting and easy to follow	4
very interesting course yet course content could be spread more evenly week  is really a lot	2
i really liked the way theories were presented and compared information is always clear and the course is very flexible which means anyone can take it	4
there are several things in the course that were able to clear up my understanding the course instructor responds to more questions than i would have expected as well the course uses a lot of mathematical notation and it helps to take some time with it but once you get the idea of conjugate priors down you can quickly employ them in your own problems the course covers conjugate priors for several different likelihoods including the normal distribution and the binomial distribution although the derivation of the conjugate priors looks daunting as it is written down the usage of the priors make bayesian statistics much easierthis course uses r and excel but is not a course in either most of the computations that are performed for the quizzes are pretty simple and require little skill in ri am glad that i have taken the course and would take another if provided by this instructor i plan to reference the materials provided in the future whenever i need a refresher	3
a good global introduction and simply explained with fun as well	3
course is not for free and misleading	1
fantastic course helping structure intuitive and acquired through experience knowledge in a ordered fashion	4
excellent course with extremely detailed lectures	4
this is the poorest coursera course i have participated in very few and short videoes that only scratches the surface of cybersecurity instead you are directed to massive amounts of readings with no guidance on what should be read to read it all includes sometimes  pages for one week not going to happen i ended up just reading the introduction glancing through the texts and searching for the answers for the quizthis course totally miss the purpose and potential of moocs and the great coursera platform its a shame	1
it was an incredible privilege to be taught by prof sachs during this course the content challenged some of the current views i held about sustainable development and encouraged my own thinking on the subject matter within my skill set highly recommendable	4
this caption project will help you to apply and have better understanding of the  courses in this specialization	4
easy to follow and well informed assignments to try on first go 	3
excellent course learned a lot of things about fundamentals of gis thanks to nick santos uc davis and coursera community	4
poor help with instructions was trying to install to linux while reading the video screen as there is little documentation or any actual explanation as to what youre doing got to a part where a command on my terminal wouldnt work and given i have no idea how it works to begin with i couldnt debug the issuealso as a general review of the little of the course i did its generally considered poor form to just read back what the viewer can see on the screen already when doing presentations was disappointed with this course	0
really helpful contents presentations with examples are awesome	4
i think the course is great  i would give it  stars however the instructor needs to develop better teaching skill each lesson is not clearly defined and he rambles on about aspects which though interesting have little or no bearing on the course objectiveas well many of the answers to the questions on the exams are not given in the lecture nor in the badly designed slides nor are the answers something that could be inferred from the lectureit is a pity because it is such an interesting topic	1
extraordinarily basic entire thing can be done in about two hours	1
cannot follow a single thing that they are talking about i have prior coding experience in other languages and i still have no idea what the instructors are getting at they all explain everything horribly and jump into huge complex things with no explanation worst course i have ever taken in my life	0
poor quality	1
the peer reviewed assignments in this course are discriminatory towards people with learning disabilities coursera is unwilling to provide any accommodation to relieve this discrimination	0
the peer review was too time consuming otherwise great course	3
the course content was excellent perhaps i expected to treat concepts a bit deeper but all in all very good	3
its already awesome  i cant see any improvement and yes thanks for providing the pdf book  it helps in studying fast	4
lectures are too fastdropping out	0
what a course elaborative and to the point	3
poorly prepared course lectutets do not have enough qualified to teach others its a shame to pay for this money i do not expect this from the university of toronto	0
the cartoons and animations used in this course really make statistics a lot easier and interesting however few modules especially the later part of probability do not explain the concepts thoroughly however this is a great place to startalso the addition of r exercises are a great idea	2
a very helpful course done in a fun way	3
very good course with clear explanations and good pacei would add some more extra material to cover some aspects that are not given in deep during the course but overall is a really good course	3
what i liked materials have quality and a professional approach speakers add value to the discussion toolkit is importantwhat i didnt like this course as most of northwestern courses is excessively short in video lectures per module in this course each module had about  to  minutes of videos per module that is clearly insufficient most courses in whartons u michigans and illinois specializations in coursera have more video materials per module than your courses in totality  to  hours per module in the three institutions mentioned in average per module against about  hours of videos on all your course modules combined that is a serious and very salient gap that i think you should reflect on in my opinion quality moocs either singular courses either specializations have to be very well balanced in content  both in quality and quantity your courses have very reasonable quality but fails completely in quantity as competition in the online elearning domain increases at an impressive speed you should benchmark what i mentioned above and do something about it or probably after  runs of your courses people with churn for more addedd value offerings in the dimensions that i pointed outgood luck	1
poor design on presentation assignment	0
great introductory course to python even though i have been dabbling in coding for a while it helped me fill some gaps in my selftaught skills	4
i learned some creative codings in html 	2
satisfactory	1
very slow moving feels like you have to sit through a lot for very obvious information i would recommend httpielanguagescomlinguistics for a more detailed and more concise introduction	1
if you do not know r studio or r programming this course will be very difficult for you the fact that they state you dont need to know this program and then require you to use it to complete tests is unacceptable week  test onward requires you to modify code or program code in order to get statistics required to answer the questions their helpful hints cause errors when used mainly because you must know the correct syntax or placement of the code to get the correct answerim very disappointed in this class and probably will not pass because i do not have the time to figure out how to program in r	0
it is quite general i liked the examples although there could be more varied examples from many other dissimilar disciplines	2
professor is really bad had to google most of the topics to understand them better not at all up to the usual coursera standards my sympathies to the people who have paid for this course	0
a must for engineers	4
generally good but exercises in week    have not been proofread and are full of mistakes too bad	2
good course but i think it needs more javascript materials	3
great course indeed can recommend it to anyone interested in mobile development	4
lots of fun learned alot	3
this is a very helpful course with in depth coverage of typographic conventions its impact and guide on creating marvellous type design	4
the course is interesting and its staff makes a great team but i think as an introduction course it should focus on the history of philosophy without entering into very specific fields of modern philosophy the fundamental notions of philosophy should be available for learners as well as the great philosophers from ancient greece to the twentieth century	2
great introductory course for programming in general if youre familiar with other languages you should skip a few videos	3
it was a pretty course that gives  view of individuals and how to motivate them very fascinating to view the clips	4
fantastic insight into dog behaviour thank you	4
the case assignments are pretty useful	3
due to many technical issues with graphlab lib i have to reduce acitivity in this curse for only video viewing 	1
the course was very enjoyable i would like to see a video lesson the geography of egypt as there is much mention of locations in the early lessons there is nothing about temples or rituals or the valley of the kings perhaps this could be a part course with more themes many of the url links i tried to look at do not work that needs to be addressed	3
the teacher is excellentthis is excellent but poor introduction to htmlthe course which is part of specialization should be much more detailed with much more axamples i think it is not worth 	1
too bored	1
boring	0
duke coursera guys come on id like to contrast this with the wharton business analytics specialization that im completing it was like night and day i mean professors in that course are presenting their own research cade massey presents research he did with dick thaler none of that happens here the information shared doesnt even flow smoothlythis course relies mainly on pdf slides if i wanted to read i wouldve bought a book at one point it even links to  articles on another website and thats in the quiz as well it seems like very little effort was put into this online class by the professors the slides themselves seemed scatterbrained several times asking questions that are never even answered it was almost as if someone took already prepared slides from a course and just kind of mashed them with a very little bit of video to make an online course even the answers to quizzes seemed extremely vague it often felt like there were several right answers or none  to me this is sloppy quiz writingi honestly expected better from both coursera and duke the only redeeming part about this course is that behavioral economics is honestly compelling despite the shortcomings pointed out	0
definitely not for a beginnerwish there were more visuals and assignments to do alongside the professor instead it is a lecture from power points that dont really line up with the assignments very wellif you have previous knowledge in another language youll do fine but if youre truly looking for a beginner course look elsewhere many assumptions are made by this professor that makes it less approachable by a beginner imo	1
the content and assignments are certainly useful and relevant however the lectures are too short and do not help much with doing the assignment as a beginner i relied heavily on google and the discussion forum to get through the assignment and i am not sure if i can actually tackle similar problems again without referring back to the prementioned resources	2
everything is there butshould be deeper for experienced persons	2
nice course but didnt include enough python code for other database vendors and wasnt challenging enough	2
gr initial course on python	3
enjoyed all the classes looking forward to the capstone	4
not as good as the first one esp near the end	2
the content was fine but the delivery method and instructions were sub par hope they will improve it	1
the slides are not at all helpful unfortunately this is a far less useful course than the companions in the specialization the quizzes tend to be glitchy and have a maddening propensity to have users type formulas	1
awesome course ymust for all beginners	4
i personally did not find it constructive enough to spend money onit is way too general and basic i expected something more articulated and not so elementary	0
cool	2
it should be helpful for people who are not working yet or is about to start they first job it is only the basic to get the idea of how to organize the work	1
i have fallen asleep during th week and it have never happened to my during any of the coursera courses im sorry but it completely failed my expectations  weeks out of  gone and i have learnt absolutely nothing about dogs yes i got some psychological basis but thats not what i looked for the lecturer politely suggests to buy his book  well if it is the same quality as the presented course than its useless	0
can be more interesting 	2
teresa is great she seems very friendly and kind but some contents are a little bit borried and difficult	2
the peer grading system is poor considering that they are learning just like usthe grading should be done automatically or by a professional 	0
very interesting simple and fun thankyou professor lou and look forward to more such videos on mechanical physics from you	4
unlike the previous courses within this digital marketing specialization this one seemed more superficial in terms of concepts and specially of materials provided presentation videos and slides covered only the essential topics and were often repetitive considering this is the last step to the capstone project i had greater expectations for it	2
very boring and didnt learn anything i didnt already know this was more like watching an anti drug propaganda film that i couldnt finish it	0
there were key definitions and concepts that were stated wrong in this course please read the student forum for details	0
a little to coach driven for me but good information and tools to use for specific conversations	2
this course is informative and introductory it has a value in generating a general awareness about asd it would be useful for parents and learners who are new to disability issues the content can be used for introducing and familiarizing with clinical practice with asd but this course has the limitation on following grounds the contents of the course are coloured with medical perspective and with pathological view point at some point this course appeared like an advertisement for the institute and its research work this course tried to cover too many things like theory practice research experience and so on but at the end it failed to do justice all finally the contents are infected with virus of medicine market and military science terms such as intervention package therapy so many terminology the unfaithful use of social in few instance look like an altruism to social science by dominant disciplinei am sure that this course has market evidence based research practice will corroborate it best wishes	1
th first three classes are very thin in content and the assignments are easy the fourth class is basically optional and it has tons of content whats the point	0
just a wonderfully straight forward course that is easy to follow and stay enthused about highly recommend this course to anyone from beginner to advanced stage of expertise as you can always learn something new	4
certainly not worth paying for this course only talks about how to install the toolsnot able to take quizzes when you try to take the course for free	0
good course to understand the basics of internet network	4
interesting insight into brain processes related to learning	3
couldve learnt this on youtube  really not very good dr eggers courses are rigorous and full of math this is just a bunch of pretty pictures shouldnt be included in this specialization	0
i have some htmlcss background i listened to the first module and then part of the second module for a intro level course to get a site up and running using word press i feel like it is missing some key information as a nonbeginner i am finding this course frustrating and not likely to continue there are definitely better courses out there	1
this is a great course overall even though it is a bit dated and a lot of more recent developments are not covered there was also a mistake in one of the quizes where they forget to mention that the values of the variables should be changed fortunately someone realized that the new values were given in an old version of the quiz	3
good content good opportunity to practice but the teacher is very fast sometime	3
good course but severely hobbled by the transition to the new platform many technical issues in the quizzes such as questions not showing up being marked incorrectly leaves the student feeling somewhat forgotten which is a shame considering the brilliant material being presented	1
excellent teaching  very simplifie	3
there are an interesting course great teachers wonderful students and l will keep on learning other courses thank you 	3
i learned quite a lot that i can use for research personal projects and general understanding of neural networks but unfortunately this course is getting quite out of date at this point i would recommend to others looking for a first course in neural networks for machine learning applications look for a newer course	2
generic history information nothing to teach really completed the tests about ios and android without even watching the videos	0
hastily put together quickly steps over lots of material some of it is out of order there is an entire video in week three that covers material needed to complete the assignment the week before for example	1
autograder on final project is very frustrating  no feedback on the code to know what it didnt like other than that everything else was very helpful and straightforward for this novice thank you	3
a good course for somebody who knows absolutely nothing about the presented subjects  like networking what is embedded software etc  everything is explained in a way your grandmother could understand itif you are somewhat familiar with them and are looking on information on what iot exactly is this course isnt really for you	2
the course as a whole is excellent  stars however the capstone project part of the specialization consists of  submissions that are reviewed by other students consequently the quality of the reviewers are of the same level as the student itself  which obviously limits the learnings from feedback	2
it was a short and good course it has videos of good quality short examples and talks every week it has lecture slides articles about the week but it was really short and contain too little information and subject i hope that you will add more information it was helpful to me and i hope that it help more to another students	2
one big userexperience comment is that i wish that the videos had been edited there are many long pauses and times where there is a lot of talking around the thing that you actually want to say i think you have some great things to say but perhaps streamlining those ideas and editing out the times when you need to pause to think which is definitely legitimate when recording yourself or other things of that nature would have definitely cut down on the length of the videos long videos arent bad if they are well puttogether and conveying information in an engaging way	2
further specific mathematical proof should be needed	3
i am an undergrad computer engineering student graduating from clemson university i found this course to be extremely intuitive wellorganized and extremely informative this is a musthave course for anybody interested in learning about machine learning both in general and in specific	4
i enjoyed the practical videos but the lecture slides had too much text on them i think	3
a great course for people who want to learn basic korean excellent	4
was an informative and even fun course however was too easy and i wish that there was more deep dives and challenges to push me further	3
good and useful content but some problems in vids	2
too much theory less practical things	0
a pure misapprehension it was the course involved many interesting conceptions like how modern conceptions of civil society differ from hegels and discussions of many really worthy persons like pablo casals bronisław huberman or ai weiwei but did not pertain music as such mere two peer reviewers per submission turned peer reviewing into a kind of lottery	1
it seems the instructor jack wu didnt prepare the course material	0
good to have a brief knowledge	3
the three stars are because the parts actually giving information had value and i learned some interesting things the  stars were removed because of the truly obnoxious plugging of the profs own book and research project he goes on and on about how fantastic it is how we can all participate in scientific research but if i am supplying data why do i have to pay for that privilege if it were really about the research he would want my data whether i paid for it or not the course felt mostly like one big plug to make money to make this course worthwhile you have fast forward a lot through the sales raps which includes a few lectures in their entirety its also much better at twice speed but most classes are 	2
it gives good information but frankly covers way too many tools at the end and the explanations are good but somewhat rushed some parts were a little boring as no immediate practical use seemed on the horizon	3
awesome course from a fantastic instructor	4
you need to have deep knowledge in matlab to get pass the assignments i have spent more time figuring out how the simulations are implemented that really learning about the target algorithm to implement	0
good introductory course but a bit too superficial	2
this course is a first time programming class using python this is not what i was looking for i wanted an introduction to python for someone who knows a some programming already also this teaches python  which no longer cuts it especially for an intro class where youll be taking further work it may have made sense when this class was done  years ago it does not nowthe teacher was very lively and engaging and i would enthusiastically recommend taking an online class with him but the class is out of date and not what i was looking for	1
good course but overpriced in comparison to other offerings on coursera which are more comprehensive and cheaper	3
this is the third coursera course i have completed i am nearing completion on two others i had high expectations for this one but it was the only one i have been disappointed in in comparison with other moocs ive participated in which have clearly been designed with online delivery and audience in mind the format of this mooc was not engaging its also baffling that they would spend nine weeks on public policy in the st century and only include one female speaker and not a single person of colour the st century at the university of virginia must look quite different from the st century where i am there was also a lot institutional promoting of the university of virginia  batten school itself which i havent experienced in other courses while i did find some of the speakers and subject matter to be of interest i had hoped for more from this mooc	1
just wasnt a fan of the videos way too long and oftentimes unrelated to the course material quizzes had no connection to the lectures either	1
i found a number of the lessons were light on content but i have guilty knowledge having used arcmap on and off for the past few years a lot of the meat of this course is replicated in similar or only slightly more detail in the followon class in the specialization if you have experience with gis or arc i would strongly recommend skipping this class and moving directly to gis data formats design and quality	3
well structured course its an important one for specially engineers and scientist	3
very little participation so very little help to be found on the forums and from what i can tell absolutely zero staff participation after a couple weeks its looking like a waste of money	0
knowledge obtained is very valuable but teaching stuff should improve by solving more examples in detail	3
this course needs a cleanup of loose ends on some of the assignments some assignment requirements are very ambiguous and in some cases the solutions are not matching the requirements of what was due	2
the interviews in week  is totally worthy to watch	3
its a good start but needs more examples within the course and more projects to work on	2
wey easy for the person with some python experience but the best part is that takes only hours to complete all assignments and quizes	2
this was actually pretty hard i felt like the questions asked in the quiz were considerable above and beyond what was taught  and the amount of r itself taught felt like being thrown in the deep end	2
this course is very important for life 	4
a good course for people who are trying to lean the basics of cyber securityregardskashif	2
the biweekly assignments mixed with the biweekly lessons is a really great course structure the audio on some of the videos interviews can be poor and i wish some lectures especially the last one were more in depth but over all great course with a good pace	3
i had high expectations of this course but must admit im pretty disappointed navigating the course feels unintuitive and clunky not sure if thats just a coursera thing though the actual content video looks great but is unfortunately exceedingly brief so much so that it feels like this entire course could have just been a single article in fact theres not much presented that really benefits from the video format most instruction in the course is centered around brief talks or artist interviews and thus youre often just looking at two people talking or an artist showing you their work while they talk you never even see anyone draw to my recollectionthe work in the course feels rather phoned in at times too questions such as what did you find interesting about the video you just watched seem unnecessary and too elementary to contain any real value especially when the videos are so briefhaving said all that i do think the people who made it are genuine and have passion for comics and comics education and ill continue to follow their efforts on that front	1
course needs problems with explanations andor better feedback on quizzes there is no way to tell what error one has made  it could even be rounding a student forum might be helpful tooapplication of some formulas is not clear leading to errors on quizzes in some cases i have used external resources to give me a way to achieve the correct result	1
nicely outlined and broad in scope but brians presentation is kind of dry it often appears that he is reading off a script and sometimes his emphasis on technical details takes away from ease of understanding	2
this is ok and i enjoyed the humour and feeble running gags in the lecturesbut it doesnt justify the ripoff pricing at all	0
too us focused	1
i really enjoyed this coursethe explanations were very clear she caught up my attention and i also love the book food love family i absolutely recommend everybody in this course to get itas a testimony my life has totally changed i started love cooking i enjoyed trying new foods and i want to make a better world by education in nutrition and the need for all parents in the planet to know more about how can they love their family better by eating healthy fresh and homemade food togetherthank you mayacheers from zacatecas mexico	4
the course achieves its objectives but the assignments require too much effort for solving general problems and relatively little for parallelismrelated tasks in other words understanding what the problem is takes far more time than solving it the legoassisted teaching is a definite plus though	3
i am very much thankful to mr andrew ng for designing this entire course in such a beautiful way that it had made my machine learning concept so clear now i can commence my ai research work	4
good cloud compyting and cdn lectures and materiallack of practical examples and use cases in big data track	2
mehi appreciated the new perspectives on learning and the smaller chunks of video and assignments which allowed me to spread the work out over the weekthe thanks for learning about learning phrase was fine for the course introduction and the final module but became annoying as the closing phrase of every videodr sejnowskis skills are reading a teleprompter distracted me  i suggest doing some practice and redoing the videos when the tp wont be such a distraction watching his eyes track back and forth didnt do it for me	2
bad or superficial explanations the instructor speaks very fast and you need to continually stop the video to keep the pace some interesting commands and are shown but the instructor seems to be tired of explaining them and defers explanations to lots of links at the end of each video	1
this course hardly has any new content and a lot of it is also repeat from previous courses	0
good course for everyone	3
great course	4
its a little rapid fire but the exercises are excellent for applying the firehose of functions and concepts from the lecture	3
this is a very basic course the contents do not cover a whole lot of ground i personally did feel that there is a lot of repetition and this course did not help much  i somehow feel this course and the next  the practical one  could have been combined into one otherwise not worth  courses of money	2
this is certainly not andepth look at smartphone technology the lecturer just reads aloud the text on screen without fleshing out the concepts therein or providing any explanation anybody can tell me what an acronym stands for  i want to know what these features actually do how they work how theyre developedi have no desire to upgrade to the whole package for this course its a time waster	0
the best course so far though thats not saying much this course would be better as a follow up to an example workflow showing an end to end analysis	2
the best course i seen so far	4
subject matter was well presented except too many stops to push his book	2
the course tests are at times partially unrelated to the content of the lessons in the test of lesson  we are asked if removing jargon from an analysis makes the analysis clearer this is never mentioned in the coursethe question does not have a unique yesno solution it depends on the context in particular on the audience of the analysis and report if im talking to technical people who knows a lot about the topic jargon can be useful on the other hand if jargon is not documented it can be confusinghow are we supposed to know thisthis is just one example but all the courses of the eds specialisation had these issues i dont know if it is a language barrier or what but i feel that i didnt have a chance to study more to get a better score you either happen to have the same idea of the teacher or you dont and this is not professional	0
in lectures rate of speech is really fast and in some presentations are not clear	0
by the end of the course you do start to develop the hacker mentality the course writers want you to develop that being said it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given nonprogrammers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers a ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums if these really are core concepts as described by the mentors one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources it really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics tons of time on fairly advanced topics and almost no time on critical intermediatelevel content	1
very us centered and assignment not well connected to the lecture	0
exciting coursevery useful for those who would like to improve their computation skills python applications in scientific simulations and etcthis course were recommended to me as a one of the best introduction course to the machine learning therefore i recommend it to you too	4
not quite what i was expecting from a leading economist at yale	1
it was too simple for my taste and not very fullfilling science wise	1
nice course it gets you started maybe they could lower the price for the verified certificate lets say  since its just an introduction thanks for making me discover the world of github	4
thank you very much mr bloomfield  great presentation excellent demonstrations indoor and outdoors and very assuring oratory skills appreciate all your efforts and looking forward to yet another opportunity to meet you virtuallyone small area of disagreement though  i refer to your video week  falling balls i time frame  how things work topic on weight and mass of an object where you point out two items from the grocery store namely the chocolate bar and the bag of cookiesfollowing information from us fda regarding food labeling guide net quantity of contents statement should the net quantity of contents be stated in both grams and ouncesanswer food labels printed must show the net contents in both metric grams kilograms milliliters liters and us customary system ounces pounds fluid ounces terms the metric statement may be placed either before or after the us customary statement or above or below it each of the following examples is correct additional examples appear in the regulationsnet wt  lb  oz gnet wt  lb  oz  g ml  pt  fl oznet contents  gal  lfor additional info please refer to the following link for detailed info on what us fda agrees to  httpwwwfdagovfoodguidanceregulationguidancedocumentsregulatoryinformationlabelingnutritionucmhtmincludedview above i presume that the value of the grocery contents shown in metric system is its net weight not mass and makes it easier to understand for people from countries that follow metric systemlet me know if i am wrongwarm regardsravi sudame	4
this seemed more appropriate for a startup and most of the content was rudimentary	0
hard work but very well explained lots of exercises and good content from a great university	3
the eeprom project in week  is undoable with the specified simulator as the simulator is simply not functional i tested different computers windows and mac operating systems different browsers different security settings etc nothing works the assignment is also way beyond the level of an introductory course in addition the complete lack of discussion forums attached to the course suggests that it is preferable to shut off discussion than to address the problems speaking of which a search of the general forums indicate that this has been an ongoing issue since the latter half of  seriously what the hell many people dont have a ton of extra money to throw away on garbage and you are selling a defective product	0
not the expected quality	0
this was the most arduous undertaking i have ever been through my frustration is not with professor wobbrock who is obviously an expert in his field though sometimes i felt like hes speaking in high valyrian and not english my disappointment lies with ucsd which included the course of such depth of information and a strong requirement for understanding r without much thought on whether students will be able to follow i feel that going through this course was largely pointless because im not going to retain much of the depth of the material in the long runbased solely on this experience im not going to be recommending this specialization to anyone	0
really nice class i love the teachings and the exercise are very different and interesting too	4
good to learn from the master but not very detailed and hands on	2
the course has a very important content but i believe that it could improve its quality develop better slides the teacher could be more dynamicother features like innovative assignments based on real life partnerships with companies to provide content and everything that could be a differential to the course will be awesome	0
great lectures big content high academic level butlectures are deeply dull all but  or  on nearly  are long static videos of a lecturer speaking like heshe is reading sometimes even robotlike speeches no cacthy at allsessions are based on peer evaluation but often to find peers is a problem i worked hard to do my assignment on time then i had to switch sessions because no one was assessing my work	1
the content drags and can be boring	2
overall the content is good and will give you an idea of what wind energy is and what wind energy concerns the homework was really useful and welldesigned fourstar is due to some unclear explanations of certain concepts	3
waste of time and i did not learn anything from this courseit is basically  weeks of the facilitator asking questions without offering much in the form of answers	0
i feel like it was rather short and not too detailed	2
the explanation and content in teaching video is too brief for the assignment it cannot not provide sufficient concept and knowledge for student to complete it especially who not familiar with pandas	2
the course is really worse than previous too information is to abstract the teacher tells some obvious things the one thing i liked are course materials  for this i give  stars not 	2
nice basic course on astrobiology	4
im glad i didnt pay for this coursenothing new obviuos advice and basic informationnice instructor with a clear pronunciation and interesting videos in module 	1
the contents of the course are interesting however it is a shame that you can only access the quiz portion and assesments if you pay for the certificate same with the materials it would be great if the readings and the suggested bibliography details could be downloaded	1
it seemed this course was a teaser to get people to enroll inpay money to join the dogcognition program at duke i realized this in week  and did not continue the course	1
course is very selfdirected there are very few exercises and there is minimal feedback on those exercises no attempt is made to reinforce learned knowledge over time eg spaced repetition nor is there any definitive list for what knowledge should be gleaned from this course emphasis is placed on the students teaching themselves and learning through experience with no attempt to actually understand the learning process or rest the course design on a scientific basis standard filler course for an empty education system	1
no allow to submit quiz	0
the topic is interesting the course content is presented clearly and the lectures are informative while the assignments can be challenging they really help to reenforce the lessonsfrom what i gather the class was recently moved over from an older coursera modeldesign this is frustratingly apparent at times some information can be difficult to find particularly in the discussion section i would love to see this class updated to match the quality of some more recent classes i have taken	3
this is a great mooc i really wish we can enjoy more frenchoriented courses like this i did not like that is basically paytolearn other thant that i loved it	3
very helpful	4
the prewritten code in the assignments is not so good	1
good professors but you will not learn a lot since it is more or less an introduction for the other courses of the specialization good if is not used as standalone	3
too superficial basic and short vs my expectations it might be because high expectations or another target audience for the course but full course content could be fit to the first week	2
gives you needed basics on html css and javascript for the rest of the specialisation however could definitely expand the js aspects a lot more explaining the type system the prototype chain concepts making us aware of what the language can and can not do  to  more weeks would have been expected from this course	1
pace is extremely slow the instructor writes and talks simultaneously the words are put so slow that it puts me off too sleep at times i love taking courses where the instructor speaks at the right pace and keeps you involved carlos the co instructor one of the perfect mooc is calculus one by jim fowler	1
this could probably be better broken into two one week courses history of phone technology and intro to iot many reviewers say they bail out in first few lectures because content seems too far removed from iot i enjoyed the last few lectures with examples of iot but could have skipped the rest	2
i would like to have more participation on the forums	3
i wish the courses are more project oriented this is a very good introduction but atleast you could provide some optional projects or some tasks	1
very boring lectures the professor should not read the slides but actually try to speak her own words because this is causing lost interest and as a result less attention paid and less knowledge received	1
it was informative and had the rightlevel of difficulty	4
the only setback i had was during the purchase of the course my amount has been deducted from the bank but no intimation from this is obtained neither from coursera nor paytm please dont ruin your image because of this except for that  this is an excellent course material loved going through the videos and assignments was equally challenging and fun to learn rorthanks ps  please initiate the repayment process or at least reply to students grievances in the help and support forum	2
course content is way too easy and inadequate to do any useful work	0
training material and assignment levels dont match up better training material and videos expected	2
simple introduction easy to follow probably too simple	3
这是一门能够使我受益终身的课程my way of learning has really been improved after taking this course	4
the content is good but the pace is too slow additionally the way the content is presented is very flat id prefer a bit more passion and enthusiasm all in all a decent course but nothing that couldnt have been learnt just by browsing and playing around with gcp trial	1
this is not a course  this is a  minutes lecturethe idea is greate but this lecture is only start its very brief and not profoundthis more advices and not scientifically oriented	0
it is so much fun  and i learn a lot from it	4
it is such a helpful course	4
visuals were not great content was a bit irrelevant	1
i find it very tough to understand everything buying the course book helps to overcome this you have to dedicate a lot of time	2
videos with guest speakers were unhelpful also quizzes were not accurate and poorly written questions	2
a great and gentle introduction or review of fundamental concepts in python programming and basic computer science the lectures are clear and the assignments are relevantwelldesignedthis course series is second only to mitx x over at edx which is considerably more challenging timeconsuming and somewhat better executed the code grader for the mit course test a wide array of cases to ensure that the student has minimal leeway in terms of shortcuts while one could easily fool the autograder in this course the assignments also lack depth and challenge compared to the mit assignmentsoverall the course is well organized and a great option for beginners	3
this course is rather bad not well rehearsed and hastily delivered especially in comparison with other indepth course of this specialization the course is more of a caret package review then actual machine learning i learned how to use the	1
it has too many bugs	0
i advice not to take this coursewhy the professor is never there to read your assignments he leaves that totally to other students like yourself to grade your written assignments and they do not read and give you a random grade in  secondsdont take it you will waste sooo much time on this one	0
absolutely brilliant inspiring insightful	4
i want to bring it to courseras attention that this specialization on conflict management is poor quality poor value and hardly any content week  is only a welcome lecture it is a  week course stretched out to  months so that students can be charged money it should not be a paid specialization it does not meet courseras high standards can you please forward this review to the right person	0
this was an excellent course but rather brief the information was easy to absorb there is a lot of value to taking the course	2
generally this is a good course it has a good bit of definitions about markets as an individual investor i picked up some information on net present value pricing of stock now that the courses are not free we have to determine does the cost provide the value for me i think of the specializations as being one semester of schooling a general semester last  weeks and thus one specialization last  months with a capstone project so about  weeks total cost of the specialization is roughly equivalent to one semester class at most colleges the advantage to the current layout of learning is that it puts the information into a structured timeline this places time limits on the info which has a tendency to keep me moving toward the goal	3
too easy for financial spreadsheets	1
i am not sure peer review is eventually working in this course	1
really interesting but also really difficult to finish the assignment it would have been great to get a sample assignment just to get an idea of how it could look like	2
good course	4
the course content was comprehensive thorough and required note taking with preparation for quizzes solid academicallysome of the assignments required use of third party applications and websites that did function as anticipated or are no longer supportedpeer grading was very poor it frequently seemed students did not read submissions off handedly grading at times comments did not match the scores such as nice work or good job while giving only  stars	2
course did not meet any of the expectations neither excel nor the analysis part should have focused on one of the aspects to make it more stronger in my opinion deviated  stressed too much on statistics and model building regression logistic regression etc but did not do justice to that also	1
i loved this course videos are very clear and well structured that for me with nonlaw degree was very easy to follow and systemize my knowledge thank you very much	4
bad video quality errors in tasks and descriptions no clear path through the course	0
although better than the previous course it still was not very insightful i wanted to know the components of the integrated plan and not how someone was successful majority of the class was just copy from stokes book you can take that book and learn it yourself the style of teaching does not really challenge or give insight	2
the content of the course was actually very helpful but the way the assignments are made took all my motivation away they use an external tool where one has to enter the information for the assigments at the end you get a pdf and then you have to copy paste that again into coursera the emails are often confusing and some assignements require you to do something each day for seven days in a row but dont really warn you about that anywhere so when you think that you have  days left to meet the deadline  wrong you shouldve started  days agothis in combination with the ridiculously detailed instruction videos which consist to  of a tutor reading aloud what is written on the assignment webpage chances are you get bored quickly and miss the one information that was not given on the assignment webpagein total it is very sad that this course started so great but the technical and organizational problems reduced the motivation so much	1
a bit of mumbling in the videos and some of the singlemultiple answer buttons were incorrect	3
great for beginners in data science lecturer are good and instructors are very knowledgeable and provided valuable inputs through short duration lectures	4
this is very basic and clear about social it helps me understand about the fielf of social marketing some concepts such as social network virtual community and characteristics of these are essential for making social planthe exercise seems easy but practical it is good first step for leaning social marketing hope to learn next course	3
this is a good course for deciding if you want to pursue a more advanced degree in cryptography computer science or mathematics but as part of a cyber security specialization your paying customers are most likely working professional engineers or programmers interested in practical applications of cryptography that they can use in order to create secure systems and services this is a mathematics course and your paying customers are not going to use the knowledge from this course in their jobs this is not an indictment of the instructor but of the content itself it is the wrong content for your target customer	0
great course on the leadership behavior	3
really easy course anybody can start programming and you will love it	4
this course is great the professor and the guests are professionals they went through the topics nicely i encourage people to take this course because they cant regret it	4
the course is very useful as a good overview to programming with python and a quick look at some of the basic functions is a good introduction for the later python courses in the series the first few lectures are a very general introduction to programming as a concept rather than python specifically so can be skimmed over if youre not completely new to the concept overall a good introduction to the topic	3
despite i guess the course has a pretty good coverage of the ml basics it is definitely just an introductive class in particular i was surprised by the low quality of the materialthe following are my notes and suggestions i found the lectures highly redundant with many unnecessary repetitions using a vector notation like an arrow or a simple line on top of the letters throughout the course would have make formulas much more readable too much hand writing on the slides while talking a better set of slides with blocks of text shown at the right moment would be much smoother and readable very very poor video editing many times its clear some parts of the videos were meant to be cut the desire to create a format suitable for people with a scarce algebra preparation lead to use not the appropriate terminology which would be more correct and easier to understand just realize that ml is basically applied math and without a good math knowledge it is almost pointless to approach the subject	2
the peer review assignment needs to improve the requirements	3
i dont feel like the videos were helpful in explaining and offering guidance they were boring and basically repeated everything given in the readings the delivery should be improved kevin hartman was clearer	1
started out a bit slow with material that i felt was somewhat extraneous but then got to the good part hard part of installing r and getting it working with git	3
not enough materials in the video most of the info are in the reading	1
great course	4
it could be a bit more challenging than just running scripts	1
very well presented course enjoyable and informative	3
the articles that were limited were actually somewhat helpful the google hangouts seemed lackluster and draining i would recommend more substance in the videos or moma might switch to an articlebook mooc that doesnt rely as much as people talking about their opinion without a ton of evidence or support wouldnt recommend participating in this mooc	0
like any course you get as much out as you put in the real learning comes from reviewing the reading material even as an it professional i was able to learn quite a bit imo this material should be readily available as a high school elective	3
not enough detail and information provided in the lectures to undertake the final assessment	0
good one more written assignment would have been good the one in week  was great and perhaps more incentives or reminders to use the forum some of the reading seemed rather hard going and academic and theoretical but the course was good as an intro to issues related to public policy getting to know the keywords used and showing the systemic shifts in cities over the last  decades towards a more multi stakeholder approach for a more decarbonated economy	2
this course gave a great opportunity to explore ones creativity with assignments that didnt require us to have skills in particular types of graphic expression however i also found that it didnt give me the richness of principles and techniques that ive found in other courses in this sequence i expect that for an inperson course this instructor gives individualized feedback that provides that content in a peer review situation the feedback is quite general and so doesnt take up the slack from the lectures i suggest that coursera work with the instructor to retain the current content but produce much richer lectures that have concepts and principles which students can put into practice even after the course ends	2
too simple	2
basic concept of epidemiology	3
interesting and useful to a degree but i was looking for something a little more challenging in addition the quizzes were far too easy	2
in light of r or python doing statistical computing in excel is really time consuming and backward the instruction might be ok but i lost interest beginning of week  seeing how he build binary decision model in excel	1
it could have been more in depth	1
thanks to professor barbara fredrickson and her invited participants i could learn more about positive psychology and specially positive emotions	4
its great way to learn more about ios development professor is fantastic and material is very helpful	4
very basic very clear	2
undoubtedly the course instructor is very knowledgeable however i did not take away as much from this course as i would like to it is mostly theoretical very limited examples i also missed the bio in biostatistics a title like mathematical statistical theory boot camp would be better suited i believe having a set of cases that get reused in some form over all lectures would be very beneficial for at lease mine understanding the topics the form of lecturing is not using the benefits that an online platform offers so instead of short interactive videos this has slides with lengthy essential spoken word with it hardly summaries	1
 weeks were balanced and thoughtprovoking and one was silly but entertaining therefore three starts with  stars taken out for ending a good course with a week of silliness	2
for someone who is not familiar with inferential statistics this course is too compact i lost the overall picture it seems that a dozend methods were introduced but i failed to understand under which preconditions each method is deployable i am confused	0
this is a great subject to understand the public policy challenges of the st century thanks so much	4
this is one of the best things ive ever seen on this matter prof andrews method os explanation is quite useful and easy to understand even if your not totally familiar with the subject	4
really useful and enjoyable course that was well presented it was a pity when it ended	3
this course points to good soluitons to nowadays common bad habits like procrastination or multitasking and some of the strategies are very applicable the my work environment not all because of hierarchical and cultural differencesthe only point i would like to change is the teachers tone of voice it sounded too low for me even after setting the volume to maximum i have had difficulties parsing the words this may be an issue of english not being my mother language but comparing to other courses thats is a possible explanationthank you very much	3
course does not do a good job actually explaining r or training you on how to properly use it the lectures go over the material very fast and you do not get much out of them and then the assignments throw complex problems that are very difficult you spend most of your time googling to learn it and i find that i would have learned r better if i just did that to start without this course maybe if you arent new to r and have a programming background it may not be so bad but if you are new to r and not an experienced programmer this is not the class to take to learn it	0
the material used for this course is so old that makes me feel im taking a course in the s the narration is very dull and therefore hard to follow really disappointing	0
no slides or writen support to guide the student	1
i am dropping the coursesuggestions one person talk to the audiencerather than  or  talking to each other volume and pic quality poor its going too slowlyjust not enough meat to get me engagedesp if u compare to the course by paul hegarty stanford	0
this was a very good introduction to a very interesting arts management tool the practice cases with organisations from different countries and sectors were particularly useful to illustrate the theory in the course	4
this course had fantastic content and very clear lecturing style and minimal errorsat times i felt the lectures were a bit too long and repetitive and found myself jumping through them quickly i found that andrew took minutes to say something that should only take  seconds but i am aware that most students would appreciate thisthe assignments were great only with a few bits of information lacking and one assignment requiring me to dig around in the discussion boards for a solution an error in the supplied code was causing me to fail the assignmentif i could give  stars i would but i cant give the course  stars given the points aboveoverall very enjoyable and insightful	3
i had issues uploading the assigned homeworks course was ok still a bit complex and fast to be treated as intro to ruby	1
worse taught	1
this course was very knowledgeable but it didnt hads anything to use in practice no coding and only theory however it was very good	3
the videos are too longassignments are difficultand dr asfahani is not like dr larryi loved dr larry much moredr asfahani is not interesting in his presentations at all	0
useful if you want to take pmp exam beginner info about pm but not very deep	2
awesome courseive learned a lot from this course the tutor is amazingill take the next course	4
could have been one of the best on coursera but a little broard in scope and not for beginners as more is required than taught	2
there are a lot of kinks to be worked out in this course the teaching aspect of the craft of writing is in the four previous courses this one is basically write a story get reviews	1
c	4
great course for those seeking to improve the ability to learn anything	4
more challenging problem sets as in the r programming course 	3
interesting material but its presentation is haphazard and incomprehensible in typical latin american style the presenter wanders erratically through the material in the videos in a confusing and nonlinear way so that making coherent notes is impossible the relationship between the video quiz and supplemental reading is sometimes hard to determine the workload is also vastly different from week to week including one reading of over  pages indeed a whole book  whilst other lectures demanded only a few pages worth sadly this course was one i abandoned  i lost patience with its random and frustrating structure and the limiting and perplexing nature of the quizzes i should point out i am bilingual so this was by no means a language issue if you have the patience for this or are used to this style of learning go ahead ive had to stop sadly	1
there is a huge disconnect between the lectures and what is asked in the homework assignments	0
disappointing thought it would be more involved perhaps with a real presentation graded by other participants in the course was interesting to watch the videos but it was a  minute job the other parts were ok but after the capstone i would hesitate to recommend the course	0
does not include latest developments in this industry	0
in my opinion issues aboard at course are too complex to explained in shorts termsbut the infomation was value enough for an overview approachthanks	2
this course is very poorly structured	0
its nice i particularly like the programming homework however the course is pretty much beginnerlevel and the course is too short for only  weeks	3
im sorely disappointed i learned almost nothing valuable and found the content to be so basic that i didnt get a good feel for tableau i paid  elsewhere udemy and im learning a shit ton about tableau through them tableau has great free resources too that are better than what i paid  for on coursera this class is a joke and not worth  as a ucd alumni im embarrassed my schools name is on this	0
take this course you should maybe take it twice	4
would like more exercises to test knowledge throughout the course not just one large exam at the end would prefer less choices on final exam questions to better demonstrate ones knowledge of material not testtaking skillsprofessor siedel is a wonderful professor with many years of both theoretical and practical knowledge his realworld examples allow students to apply course materials beyond academia to the business world and life in general	3
everything apart from steganography was well explained with examples i liked that the quizzes were fairly engaging and required programming exercises to familiarize you with the content	3
the course contents are covered too briefly to learn anything useful too much breadth and insufficient depth	1
a very good course i totally recommend it for those who want to get some insight into the world of energy from different perspectives	4
this was a good course and quite challenging it requires a lot of self learning if you are not familiar with pandas i wish some of the technics that were required to solve the assignments were better explained in the course material	3
very fun way to mathematics	4
i can only give this two stars at mostthe lecturers are just like reading the ppt without any heuristic teaching approachesthe assignments make me desperate always show very poor feedback message  wrong answer even the cases failed because of performance issuethe starter files given from the assignment are inconsistent with the pdf description its so confusingcouldnt get any help from forums	1
i loved the course it was way beyond my expectations everything well explained i only have on critic i think the assignment of  waypoints trajectory was not in accordance with the rest of the course imagine the tests following a level line and abruptly changes to something too hard i think the purpose here is to learn and not find out people with special skills many of our colleagues that were following the course simple gave up due to this assignment and also took  hours average for many of us that not dispose of this time since the proposed time to complete the tasks are of three hours	3
a nice introduction to game development the content is great and it doesnt overextend to the point of scaring you off game dev i would give this course  stars if it had a little more spice everything in the course felt too scripted i would suggest doing some fun live sessions on the side or something to let us know were not being taught by robots	3
good introduction course	4
excellent course i enjoyed it a lotit helped me to gain an overview over ancient greek historygreat lecturer	4
very difficult to apply the knowledge without some support material with the content eg ppt slides	0
ok coursewhen i am taking a course from wharton school and from adult learning perspective more is expected than simply small lectures and few activities some areas that i see this may be improved latest evidence based support few articlespapers on achievement and satisfaction success both parameters this is widely discussed field as subjective and objective career success in addition to same  better instrumentsscale those are easily available online some better links to career related articles from harvardcalifornia management review or organization dynamics on the topics covered	1
this course was too repetitive compare to the previous course in the specialization	1
a fine course and a necessary preliminary for the following course by the same good professor	4
really bad	0
content covered in this course was hard to learn both because it was pitched at a level that realistically was more akin to a wrap up of content already covered when in fact it was all new content and because the instructor brian caffo has not a style that was conducive to teachingthe instructor often would launch into a topic and then speed through a calculation with basically no explanationin terms of time this was one of the most intensive courses in the specialisation and id recommend taking this course alone not concurrently with other courses for that very reason	0
filled with redundant balderdash and extremely dumbeddown and slowpaced offends the learner	0
pace was slow and i was disappointed by the content level from the title i thought this would give information about the global energy business but the focus is generally on the us except for portions that discussed location use of global resources and demand and supply levels globally the class begins with analyzing supply  demand curves for energy use and production which was interesting to me and i thought meant wed be taking an economic view throughout then the large middle section covers very basic info about the types of energy production coal oil ng renewables in the world  low in factual content considering the time spent on each topic the final section about political considerations was very basic and only focused on the us i am amazed that the  branches of us government were explained on the simplest level this is a middle school  high school topic in the us i expected a more indepth class with details and analysis about the global energy business i am glad i did not choose to pay for the certificate	1
i like it but there is alot to do i am  taking this for science class and i am starting to get lost in what the are saying	1
very good material needs more users participating to be perfect but its a very good course with contents in spanish plenty of similar courses with english content so its perfect	3
a lazy reviewer gave me the score of  and left me this comment i am not able to give any score i tried very hard to understand the matter but it was difficult for me i have to score it just for me to check the other students work please dont consider my scoring here i studied hard and received this poor evauation i screamed for help many times but no one replied to my request the quality of the course is superb and my experience is completely ruined by a shitty score which does not reflect my work	0
good class	4
very organized gets you writing right away	3
excellent and well organized course	4
the course is useful and essential not only for those studying statistics but machine learning	3
sound quality could be improved in video it kind of curbs the understanding of what the teacher is saying  otherwise everythings great	3
to be honest i dont think this is worth the money	0
quizes are inconsistent with given dataset questions are bad ie what is the difference between number of distinct countries mentioned and number of countries mentioned in tweets	1
the only thing that stands between the  and  stars evaluation of this course is the fact that assignments should have a broader range of grades for the peer review like on all the rest congratulations it is a great course	3
fantastic course comprehensive and easy to follow a good introduction to the field	3
several mistakes on the translations of the exams	2
its a quick efficient way to know some trick if you are an absolute beginner now if you have some knowledge or already read a lot of articles about procrastination etc it wont help you discover new things or tips its a cool way to review it though there is no science talk at all here	2
the instructor does an excellent job but realistically there is no way to be proficient enough in a d software program after a week or two to earn a certificate the certificate is worthless in my opinion i liked the class but it seemed more like intro vs a class of any proficiency required	2
overall i liked being exposed to github and gitbash i felt this course gave me a broad overview of what to expect in the future	3
very cursory and doesnt get into analysis about why things are the way they are this course just explains who the actors their roles and environment they operate in it would have been much more interesting and useful to learn the why	0
good content well presented just too short and should provide more content	2
sometimes is dense a little bit boring	2
good learning materials however the assignments are designed for compute science students rather than professional software developers as the most important part of the assignments is not parallel code but it is algorithms yes there is parallel code in the code of the assignments but it is mostly written and your task is to implement the algorithm using this existing parallel code while in my opinion it should be the other way around  you should implement parallel code and algorithms code should be already provided for you	2
easy to understand for even a beginner	4
excellent  both content and delivery wise thanks very much more than certifying the course i believe ive learned immensely from this not so easy course and was able to related quite a lot to some of the work i did on anns mlp back in the s	3
scholarship for further modules please	3
course is simple yet very effective had a nice time learning how to learn	4
it is helpful for me	4
sorry the guy in the first video doesnt blink which is very weird the second video was so incredibly dry and boring that i completely lost interest i know this could be a fascinating course with the proper videos and visuals to help people understand it	0
love the course so far cant wait to get really good at this stuff and use it in my place of work	4
very helpful information with lots of solid practical advise prototype test and a few important questions to think about genderfication accessibility when designing excellent learning experience for game design documentation quite worth the time and effort thank you	3
could be more in depth	2
in the course info this is described as the first course in the series and that it requires no prior knowledge but the first week quiz contains questions referring to an equation discussed in the previous course	0
the best machine learning course everthis is the best machine learning course that i already did	4
only few starting videos give new information and techniques the rest  is quite useless course would be much better if it gives real tips and techniques rather than constant repetitions of the same information in different forms if you read the course contents  you already get  of what is presented in the videos	1
the course focuses on some of the most important aspects of english grammar which are used frequently also these are the topics where students tend to make mistakes however few additional topics could have been added to the course	3
amazing course really complete ive been able to learn a lot of things about web development in just three weeks thanks for this course	4
solid class overall however video lectures do not provide enough background info to complete some of the assignments expect to spend much more time than the estimated  mins to complete	3
this intro course has an excellent instructor i have used html on and off for awhilebut the differences in html and explanation of the reasons why and the semanticsmade it very valuablethe grading was frustrating but attention to detail is a component of programmingvery helpful course	4
honestly for the price paid the value given is quite low i expected to have more handson working with the hadoop ecosystem rather than this courses focus on background that really does not help one to become productive	0
much work needs to be done on this course to make it friendly to learners the quizzes and assignments do not align with what is taught in the lessons further the content in the lessons does not even show or explain what is expected from the learningi spent the majority of my time exploring the discussions to discover what i was supposed to be doing and the rest of it on google teaching myself the concepts that were not taught in the course	1
its a luring start for a series of courses	3
interesting course with a practical approach after passing the course you can easily have a personal web page with a portfolio of your grade works yaakov advises very useful resources for outofscope learning and doesnt waste time for explaining the theory instead he pays particular attention to practicehowever the total lectures time is quite impressive and the course requires students to study every free minute i feel happy after passing the course thank you for making it available	4
good for beginner but too easy for me _	4
really cool course explaining some basic physics ruling everyday life	3
i have to say i am disappointed in that i feel there is little to no interaction here between students and instructorsaides additionally the assignments are not functioning properly and it creates much confusion the instructors videos are great and have been helpful but the rest is lacking there is no way to view others bodies of work and critiques are very vague etc this is photography where is the photography from learners other than the assignments why is there no gallery here	1
rebalance of the content could make the course even better there were too many topics at week  tries should be discussed in another week the example code in the main at week  was a very good idea similar solution would make the understanding better during the other weeks	3
this course didnt talk too much about data management and visualization which made me feel quite disappointed and you couldnt feel you could practiced what you learned in the course in the assignment most part of the assignment just focused on making some comments	0
the concept of this course is unique and pretty interesting but videos are too short basic and nonspecific they have vague connection with the rest of the materials and the design of the tests and assignment is just awful the questions with multiple choice work wrong marking all the right answers is not appropriate you must choose the all of the above option but it is wrong because of formal logic the correct option here is only to match all the answers and the all of the above line also many questions are debatable and there is no answers in the materials for the course and finally the uploading of the last assignment was just impossible for more than a week and i dont know if it will ever be possible bad experience	1
the course really isnt that useful for day to day management decision making it might be more useful for those who look solely at long term data and make choices at a distance so to speak very heavy focus on charts and graphsso theres a lot to it but very little you can sink your teeth into unless you have a very specific type of management in mind	1
i would like to receive feedback about my wrong answers after i approve the course i really would like to know what were the correct answersi think that this is really important because i can learn of my mistakes	3
dr chuck is deeply inspiring in the way he makes this course so much more than just some information you could find in a book or internet forum its noticeable how he cares for keeping students interested motivated and how not only he wants us to learn python but to learn how to learn	4
without a doubt the worst course i have ever taken anywhere when the instructor who is supposed to be teaching you how to write ios apps takes no exaggeration six minutes to even figure out how to open xcode you know youre in for a rocky ride still i stuck with it for three more weeks to my horror the course only got worse from therethis course was clearly thrown together with a minimum of effort by someone who is not qualified to teach the subject its an insult to coursera customers and a major failure of quality control	0
an excellent course i only wish the portion on nonfinancial metrics included some examples or insight in how best to quantify nonfinancial metrics in do	4
when it comes down to it theres simply not the support to assist a student that has a really hard problem hacker mentality seems to equate to figure it out on your own cuz nobodys going to help you if things do not work perfectly for you then you are likely never to be able to finish because your peers dont know any better either the way this class is set up makes me angry every time i have to deal with it i would probably be just as well served doing just the swirl exercises i would quit if i hadnt paid all the way through in advance i cant believe this is the type of school john hopkins is to produce a course of this quality but i guess i have to	0
i am from chinai think the courses is easy for a senior high school students the vidio is too longit is better to make it shortat allthank you for your wonderful teaching	2
the course should be more elaborated i had to go through other reference books on statistics to understand all the topics	4
excellent course all the concepts are very well explained and the assignments are enjoyable and worthwhile highly recommended	4
the teacher can explain more and not just read through the slides	1
no doubt that this is a very helpful course for a beginner to learn python i would love to solve more assignments even if all the assignments are not graded its fine but just for sake of practice let students like me solve more of themdr chuck explains all the topics very nicely i would request him to go a little deep in topics by way of example it would have been great if he taught us the mechanism in which data is stored in dectionaries hashing	3
very basic course for american nonhealthy food consumers would never call it a university course not useful for professionals	2
the course does not offer very useful material the instructor speaks too slowly and it takes her a long time to explain simple ideas	1
the material is interesting and new on that part the instructor is doing a good jobwhat is really very annoying about this course is the fact that in case you have questionsproblems relating anything of the course material and you as said by the instructor post them to the discussion forums there is completely no reply neither from the instructor nor from the courserathere were obvious mistakes in one of the quizzes and lots of students were posting and discussing this in the forums as this was actually preventing students from passing the course but there was no answer whatsoeveri find this very unprofessional especially because of the fact that this was a paid course i do not know and i also do not care who is responsible for this  coursera or the instructors but this is something that should not be present in any of the courses on courserai liked the first course very much but the mentioned part of the second course was so annoying that i really would not recommend taking this course to new studentssorry	0
easy course	3
thanx a lot	3
as someone who knows little to nothing about computer language this is very easy going and the tas are very knowledgable	4
very rushed incomplete examples and gaps in content im not sure what audience coursera is aiming for but it doesnt seem to be anyone who doesnt already know a programming language	1
could not finish the course i found the course to be boring	0
this course lacks a level of professionalism the splicing of the videos is bad and for me actual video of how t	1
very good lectures and examples horrible autograder  very stiff and all results must be in a very strict order and format extremenly vague questions prone to misinterpretationmost of the time is not spent on analysing data or coding but trying to understand the autograder and questions the stress should be somewhere else as a whole poorly prepared course	1
i found the way in which john hopkins present the course very valuable well structured although the pace is quite fast 	3
my first course on courseravery well explained even for people who kind of lack some mathematical knowledgemany useful advices about how to use each algorithm choosing features etci would recommend it to anyone wanting to start in machine learningnb the ability to watch the video in x to x is really useful	4
interesting course to support previously knoledgement or improve it	1
this is the worst course ive ever listened and ive listened my fair share of online courses do this course only if you want to complete whole specializationprofessor is simply awful english is not her native language obviously but even that is not the problem she simply speaks sentences that doesnt make sense at all and she obviously doesnt have computer science background if she does then she is even worse then i thought	0
i am speaking from my personal experience about this course i dont mean to insult anyone or criticize the method of teaching and i am not doubting the credentials of instructors it is just what i experienced from this course that i am saying however i dont mean to discourage anyone from attempting this course this review is just a summary of what i felt about the first two weeks of this coursei dont think this course is for the beginners at all the teaching method did not quite please me it appears that the instructors and tas are simply reading the transcripts and bombarding equations on the screen also the course hasnt made any reading material available and they are not even providing the slides for the lectures as of till dec i have enrolled and completed a course on mobile robotics from georgia tech on coursera and they were using slides and at the same time the instructors were scribbling equations on the slides and ensuring that they maintain synchronicity with the learning and showing them how a particular equation emerges they also had lectures which were designed to help learners attempt the quiz and special section about matlab and how to build robots they also provided slides to revise what was mentioned in the lectures they were teaching and not reading from teleprompterthis course looked lot of theoretical and i am not sure for whom it is designed for also in the discussion forum i havent received answer to the questions that im postingsince right now its holiday season i can exempt them from not replyingi knew i could carry on with this irritation and still get the course certificate for which ive paid for but then there is no point in wasting time in which the explanation is not clear it would take me almost  to  minutes to make notes over a  minute long video i would rather read a book on this subjecti would have appreciated if they followed certain steps make some course material which will help students read and revise information suggest some readingreference material to understand the concepts which are not otherwise covered in this course use pointerstouch screen devices to show and point out which equations are being referred to and maintain synchronicity between the information given in the slides and the one said by the instructor supplementary lectures are extremely fast paced and please dont take derivation of an equation for granted and please do explainso if you are looking forward to do this course i suggest you go forward if you have an indepth knowledge about vectors matrices and calculus	0
this course doesnt contain any new information it does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known factsthere are better ways to invest your time	0
if you do not have a background in statistics do not expect to pass this course	0
course was taught by people who gave no indication they had ever bought a security they read flatly from the teleprompter and rarely looked at their audience very disconcerting and not conducive to trusting what is being said	0
its an excellent course many difficult concepts have been explained in plain language with good examples	4
too much covered	0
very basic	1
very bad and not organised	0
i havent completed the course yet but after html and css and some javascript i didnt feel like continuing the instructor doesnt suit me kind of monotonous tbh the content of the course seemed good but instructors play a huge role on delivering those content to the students so it just didnt work for me especially the short haired instructor with constant hand movement and unblinking stare which is quite unnerving	1
not about the actual effect of food on your health its just a cookbook	0
very good course material however graphlab is no longer free to use for commercial purpose	1
assignment is unclear and confusing the material which is given is not enough  i think the course is good in general but it should focus in building the knowledge more instead of leaving many things on the air and going through the material as if it were a quick review	1
you have to let us know in the beginning of the course that we have to pay for finish the course	2
i learnt a lot in this course that surprised me i went from being terrified of essays to managing to write one a few pages long thank you my biggest issue and why i didnt give it  stars if the grading is via peer review and this meant a long wait and lots of begging plus getting only one word reviews such as great not very helpful i would like a person who is experienced in essay writing to do a review but i do understand that by sheer numbers of students this would be non viable	3
the algorithms presented in this course are interesting however the quizzes contain some questions that have no apparent relation to the content of the lectures and some questions about details of the presented algorithms which are explained in neither the lectures nor in the papers from which the lectures are derived also most of the sample implementations will not run on a modern computer they only work on windows with java  installed	1
the videos did not teach anything that was going to be on the quiz so it was like answering  questions at random using google the lesson plans and project were very vague and too much time was spent trying to figure out what was even being asked	1
very nice course i learn a lot from it	4
neoliberal and neocon presentation of the matter that has little to do with how the real world works or should work had we had a fair play field would not expect anything else from the neoliberal flagman yale pretty much expected it would be the case but just wanted to give it a try	0
good course for a new beginners but its also very old compared to modern developments	3
i believe there is important to have access to the comments of our peers ive receive some bad grades and i dont know why and i think part of the learning process is get to know here im falling	2
the actual material in the course is fascinating and quite useful but as is common with so many coursera courses the enjoyment of completing the course is severely hampered by the requirement to review the final assignment of other students the purposes of these courses is to learn from experts in the field not to grade the work of others i wish coursera would really stop professors from pushing their responsibility grading the work of the students and offering their feedback onto the students who may or may not have a firm grasp of the material in question	0
personally for me who had read about neurology psychology and human behavior this course does not build a lot on my formal knowledge however it would be useful to anyone who is interested in learning and curious about brain facts and psychology of learning	2
nice the final assignment stegonography i found was difficult to convert rgb pixel values to  bit decimal values	3
i am glad this is a second python course with dr chuck and university of michigan the courses has been very useful and i have applied it in another programs that use python for to develop scriptsthanks	4
mechanically it worked pretty well just a little hard to figger out whats going on and whats important what needs to be memorized and what just needs to be understood   	2
this course is too elementary u of g is considered to be a top university in the world i am expecting an advanced course at least teach us some asset pricing theories such as apt thanks	1
is a good course	3
over reliance on student grading material does not map well to the quizzes	1
excellent course i learned a lot and lectures are wonderful	3
i would apply for this course again and again wonderful experience the best course ever taken congratulations to all the team	4
i like it a lot i wish though that this website was better flowing with the lectures i have to refresh multiple times to make sure the video is where it should beidk how to explain it	3
would have like to jump straight to the material although i understand some may need it the command line course was pretty basic this course on its own doesnt give much one can get started with programming with r wo missing too much	2
decent course content but fairly basic however the peer graded evaluations are subjective and take too long to get feedback and progress in coursework i will not be taking another course that uses this loose of a peer evaluation	0
charging for free content really go fuck yourselves	0
this course starts quite well but its awful at finish	2
week  a little disapointing	1
coming out from two very good predecessors c parts  this course is somewhat a disappointment the contents are too broad without real focused depth and too much time spent on background info in almost all lectures there ought to be more handson practices and the assessments should be more challenging towards understanding rather than matching terms	1
the course is really interesting and usefull congratulations	3
i learned a lot and i love the teacher	4
simply great	4
this course is not good in giving lessons with examples that will help a with studying for the quizzes	0
very american perspective	0
this course feels a lot like its being taught by a nonteaching professor the lectures are very long not chunked for easy viewing to the point where i couldnt download to my phone for offlineoffwifi use there are very long locallyhosted readings so theyre hard to print and you cant add them to an offline reader app and the reading section for each lesson seems to be a bibliography rather than actual reading assignments because there are no links and some refer to selections without giving page numbers or in at least one case a multivolume book the information is comprehensive and very valuable but the delivery is very lacking as a mooc	1
great instructorslots of historical references and terminology i would prefer more details about how stuff actually work  in simple laymans termslooking forward to the second course	2
i have met with nothing but frustration with this course though the lectures are understandable but the readings are comparable but unrelated to the material in the lectures i also had no kind of communication with instructors tas or other student for help it is ridiculous that there is no feedback forums and this seems to be the only course that handles it that way if this an institutional decision to not have feedback it seems that these instructors andor the university of california irvine do not care to help students i would not recommend this to anyone	0
i found the content was great but the style of lectures were a bit too robotic and not conversational this didnt help the learning process also the course admin might consider explaining on and where timestamp datediff more than what was provided	2
lowlevel content for people with no teaching background	0
another good course in the python specialisation youll need to have a thorough grounding in dictionaries and lists for this module so make sure youre across the concepts and syntax of those data structures 	2
this is not a course for a beginner in programming if you are interested in learning r i would recommend going to datacamp and starting there the lecture videos were not engaging and the jump from the lecture and quizzes to the programming assignments was quite significant as others have pointed out the lecturer for this course does have a preprogramming assignment on his github repository to aid in the first programming assignment but this was not easy to locate nor advertised well had to scroll through discussion forums before i saw someone mention it the swirl assignments were the only saving grace for a class that was otherwise not engaging or structured well the class could stand to be restructured for example it would have been nice for the lectures to cover the str function before our first programming assignment overall this class does seem to be a good choice for a refresher course if you already have some experience coding in r but be wary if you have little to no programming experience	1
pure functional approach to solve problems	3
great quick course to introduce concepts that everybody should be familiar with really easy to follow	4
very usefull course great	3
although the course material is very good but what i believe is that image processing is a course where only theory isnt sufficient programming assignments should have been made important and compulsory part of the course instead of just mcq quizzesthis is the reason why andrew ngs machine learning on coursera appears very engaging whatever they teach in theory has to be implemented as part of programming assignments which makes learning experience wonderfuli hope that you will give due importance to programming assignments from next session	2
terrible a waste of time and money i recommend doing statistics with r from duke instead this one should be taken off coursera	0
assignment grading feedback can be made better	3
useful for my career	4
the course lectures were subpar and didnt cover the material in the assignments googling for answers and checking stackoverflow for code is a great way to get tips but it doesnt teach you the core material i would have rather had links to supplemental readings that the materials were based on i would not recommend this course as an introduction course unless youve had significant experience with python data structures and know how to work with lists dataframes and iterate over those	1
it is really a good course in machine learning before taking this course i never thought i could understand the technique in such an interdisciplinary subject	4
honestly for something that says advanced in the title i thought it was a little too basic there isnt enough depth and a lot of it involves common sense perhaps a more casestudy driven course would have been interesting with more qualitative essay responses required rather than cutanddry multiplechoice	2
i did not enjoy how this course was taught it was confusing and hard to understand the professor did not go at a pace i found helpful	0
excel seems not like the ideal tool for portfolio optimization a business plan or a net value calculation would have been much more in the spirit of this specialization	2
lecture can be really unclear sometimes because lecturer breezes through the actual implementation of trainingpredicting use x y and z underlines some stuff on screen and youre donealso lots of mistakestypos in lecture and quizzes	1
the lecturer was really great and was able to explain things enthusiastically and simply unfortunately i feel the level of the course is too low i think the basis of calculus has to come from rigorous definitions of the concepts involved and firm understanding of the proofs hopefully i will get some of that in your calculus two course	2
frequent and forced peer reviews with no opportunity to complete once deadline is missed makes this course nunecessarily difficult for people with conflicting schedules and responsibilities	0
academical with close to no real life value	0
overall about financial markets with very deep discussion about history of finance	4
this course was very informative to me personally as i am a millennial and was born into the digital a few points of criticism to dr picker however given that the title includes law and economics i had a feeling throughout most of the course that we were learning more about law than economics the few segments where he broke away and described netneutrality as an economic device was perfect in that structure but if that could be applied with some of the hypo examples he used in those other terminology areas i would not be saying law outweighed economics i must admit i only come from reading economic books by physical economists never took principles so i may not see things the way he does but i just want to make clear that someone like me welcomes economic charts graphs empirical testing with defining that fields jargon other than that it was a series of lectures and crafted very scholarly	3
useful but as with the first course of the specialization very light on content	2
it would have better if the talking and coding was at the same time so that we can see its relative changes which we can see in previous course	1
very intensive and rewarding course im feeling more and more prepared to teach english now 	4
great course againgreat teachersinstructors easy to follow information and i didnt think i was going to be able to make a plan but i made it thanks	4
not enough content  would have preferred more examplesscenarios that included conflict resolution solutions	2
the assignments are more of trial and error and not very helpful the course material and content is good teaching staff is nowhere to be found	1
brilliant course this was my first course and the first time in philosophy i really enjoyed professor michael roths breaking down of the content matter it motivated me to read nonfiction on a regular basis and changed the way i view the world to a certain extent the course is easy to follow through and seems especially useful for beginners in this field	4
course content is good however material is explained fairly quickly and the lady who is lecturing is almost impossible to understand due to a very strong accent and a very mechanical reading which made me want to skip all her lectures	1
the connection between lectures and assignments needs to be improved	2
final assignment is too difficult to do for beginners its crucial for them not to pass the course unless getting a certain score on the final assignment	1
very good and fun	4
lovely accent great lecture for the younger teacher the older teacher really confuses me sometimes cos the language he used was very academic and hard to understand besides he has a tendency to read other than lecture	3
good theoretical knowledge the program create awareness about marketing analytics the program could be improved with more detailed examples across different industry it would be logical to have a part  where theory is applied for practical learning	2
not enough material provided to successfully complete final exam more detailed explanation needed for newbies in python and especially for newbies in programming as it is  i am assuming target group	1
very handson course instructor wont teach everything students need to do some search on the internet to complete the assignment it is not that easy but quite rewarding	4
very interesting theoryoriented course you are give the main tools to dig deeper into the science of digital markets in the future explanations are clear and concise recommended	3
i learned a lot but there are definitely errors in the course material and a entire missing video the course needs to be updated	2
thanks great course im trying to learn more about ml	3
at first i didnt know what to expect i thought it was going to be pretty hard because of my lack of experience in that specific area it turns out that every lesson is perfectly explainedthe quizzes are not easy toughhighly recommended	4
the language of this video is to high its like to be for reading more than speaking  too formalthe content is quite good but it needs more time in order to fully understand it	2
enjoyaoverall very useful introduction	3
the introduction is great after that its unbearably boring	0
amazing and  useful	4
the content was potentially interesting but the delivery was slightly below expectations in my opinion the topics and discussion could be possibly a bit more factual and focused it was quite difficult to go through transcripts of interviews because they were interrupted by the interviewer	1
great course i highly recommend it	4
the course is very useful in helping you understand team dynamics and their roots in structures and i feel even more importantly the norms and behavioral practices that we develop in groups there are very good leads onto how to put it into practice my perception was that the last quarter on team performance and learning which might be critical for actual success was rather superficial in comparison to the other topics covered	3
great course but much too fast paced	2
there are too many poured notions without practical explanations or case studies slides are read bullet point after bullet point without added value the course is not compelling in any way too many references to a book said to be not compulsoryin the final exam right answers are not giventhe course gives you just a smattering of the subject nothing that you can apply with confidence on the job	1
i think the notes given after the lectures should contain the formula the students need also the quizes should show the correct answers once you completed them if not you cant figure out why the questions are wrong	2
course content was excellent and very interesting the presentation could be improved however at times i found it hard to hear what was being said due to poor sound quality nevertheless the course has served as an excellent introduction to chinese culture and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about it	3
excellent course well organized and good summaries after each lecture	4
material is outdated and course assignments failed to challenge thinking and encourage critical engagement with the content provided	1
i would give this course  stars if possiblei am amazed that anyone rated this course better than  or  starsthe lectures are not focused on the information that is necessary for the obnoxiously long and tedious assignmentsthe assignments are poorly written and demand too much ruby expertise for a course meant for ruby novices i spent over  hrs trying to complete week s assignment and still could not finish i became so frustrated and actually angry at how difficult this course is designed i decided to quit coursera should not allow there to be courses that evoke such frustration and emotion john hopkins should be embarrassed that their name is associated with the pedagogical malpractice that is this specialization seriesfoolishly i paid for the entire specialization up front and coursera refuses to refund me for the remaining two courses which i have not even taken	0
one of the best course i have taken and would recommend it to everyone who wish to start a carrier in gaming	4
an all round introduction to the field of neural networks using a historical perspective and looking deeply in to the theory the lecturer is the godfather of neural networks gives a good perspective of recent research by his group and othersthe course has limited programming assignments in matlaboctave that dont really give you a good idea how to implement the ideas in the course this is why  stars not however the phenomenal ideas presented and the in depth theory mean i am now bursting to teach myself how to build these systems because they are so fascinating	3
great content and very good teacher	4
some calc and formulas are not clear otherwise the course allowed to have a general overview on financial instruments and trades	1
too much information loaded	2
the video lectures are not adequate too much selfstudy effort is needed to have a good understanding of the subject the time allocated for this topic is not enough	0
bad teacher extremely disappointing 	0
there are too many mistakes and misleading statements made in the course material there were a lot difficulties with submitting assignments in order to move forward in the course i had to give up because i dont have time to be bogged down like thisthe students comments and discussion would be useful if they can be accessed from within each lesson i cant make heads or tails of what the discussions were referring to when they are all clumped together at the course web site instead	0
unfortunately this wasnt what i expected from the course maybe since i didnt take specialization but i feel that this course was too theoretical i understand the history of seo but im not confident how useful itll be in reallifecommercial sense	0
a good learning experience very systematic course	4
the speaker isnt very good he speaks looking at his monitor all the time while he is reading the slides i am not very happy about this course i think it could be better if subjects would be deeper	1
excellent class i recommend it to anyone trying to learn programming dr chuck is a wonderful teacher the class progresses at a nice comfortable pace his lectures and code examples are thorough and informative he takes the mystery out of programming and gives you the tools to make you feel like learning to code is attainable thank you dr chuck and coursera	4
very slow	0
i found this course to be the most enjoyable so far the course has inspired me a great deal	4
a enjoyable and well laid out course mathematics level high school some rigorous algebraic proofs though not essential to pass	4
i really enjoyed the last part of the course related to the gesture interaction and the practical exercise on third week but overall i missed much more modern materials to show us in an input and interaction course or an interaction speciality i do expect more other audiovisual support than a teacher and readings	2
this course has a high quality i highly recommend it to any public and especially to medical personal	4
i think this information is very dated  calories incalories out high carblow fat recommending exercise to lose weight vegetable oils recommendedanimal fats denigrated     so many recommendations that have little science behind them and which have not produced good results for  of the people who have used them ive lost weight with a lower calorie diet and exercise so yes it can work but it is very difficult ive kept it off easily for two years with a high fatlow carb eating plan ive changed my exercise to mostly pilates when my weight stabilized and i enjoy it enough to stay with it knowing how difficult it is to stick to a low fathigh carb diet  which causes me to struggle with cravings even when i am eating unprocessed organic seasonal local food  i hate to see a low fat diet recommended to people struggling with losing weight i recommend the big fat surprise and good calories bad calories as an alternate view of healthy living	1
the exercises are not very interesting the exercises initially focusses on identifying a leader who we have worked with but it should also focus on how am i as a leader what is my level of emotional intelligence how do i scale up basis some test etc i lost interest in the course because it was more about seeing some one else as a leader than myselfthere is a lot of research into the course yet it is too theoretical  not put in precise  interesting manner the module needs to be shorter	1
i didnt like the class despite getting  on pretty much every assignment i learned very little from the class i dont think  of what was in the class was useful to me at all the grading for the class had ludonarrative dissonance with the quizzes the projects were graded by peers but the rubric was nonsensical  scale for submitting a pdf for example so someone might give you a  for submitting the pdf and thus you wouldnt get a fullscore it was just idiotic	0
interesting but not much practice despite the title	2
the class is well organized and prof andrew covers many ml topics that are very practical and easily to learn even for people without any ml experience im pretty sure if we follow the class and finish all the assignments the students should have a very comprehensive view of what ml does and how it can solve the real problem for more advanced technologies and mathematics proofs this class does not explore much however it cannot stop me liking this class	4
this course is opening my eyes in various aspects and exceeds my expectations bravo to all involved in it especially professor andrew ng	4
fantastic and fun	3
one of the best courses on htmlcss and javascriptunlike other courses which directly take to higher concepts leaving behind all the foundational conceptsthis course teaches the foundational concepts first and then gradually introduce higher concepts as wellthus making the learning process pretty easy and at the same time making concepts clear and free of doubtsi like this approachi would highly recommend this course for those who want to understand the basics of htmlcss and javascript and clear all doubts which are otherwise created by directly jumping into higher conceptsand last but not the least thanks coursera for providing best online courses and thanks johns hopkins university for presenting this beautiful course	4
this course  actually both the nd and rd courses in this specialization  are like take your interested but mostly uninformed friend to work day give them some stacks of paper to sort then shown them what a correctly sorted stack looks like youve only got one day at work with your friend so be kind enough to humor them with a very cursory explanation of what sorting is about but you cant really teach them much in such a short time so set them to task sorting pile after pile hey look your friend is now a practiced sorterthese courses are really for folks who can spend much more time than advertised sure you will see lots of really cool things  like angularjs grunt bower etc  but dont come into this believing that youll really learn them because that is just not possible with the time allowed this whole thing is about exposure not deep understandingwant to learn the guitar this is like going to watch a very slow concert and then having the guitarist hand you their instrument put your fingers on the correct frets and then strum the strings for you see  now you can playthinking of learning algebra how about if i simply told you to write the numeral  then the addition symbol then the letter x then the equals symbol and finally the numeral  and then proceeded to tell you stepbystep what you should write on the page in order to solve for x would you have learned about solving equations at most you would have written a workable example for solving a certain kind of equation but i doubt youd be anywhere near proficient after being handheld through one exampleon the positive side i was exposed to many different things in the webdevelopment world  that i cannot argue against however this course could be so much more the model of having students watch a video of a person talking about coding whether in front of a power point slide or a text editor full of code is borrowing from the worst of the lecturefirst classroom experience of most of higher ed its a bummer that we arent moving in a different direction with this stuff after so long but i guess its still what people expect or at least have learned to cope with	1
this was a giant advertisement and got tiresome very quickly	0
excellent course many materials very good lectures and very practically comprehensive exercises congratulations	4
very good course really learnt a lot thanks	4
dont waste your time just touch supper surface about this technologies most time just mention the name of these technologies	0
ive spent a bit of time going through the specialisation paid for one course here and other courses online that offer machine learning with python i looked at books too ive come to the conclusion that its unforgivable to teach it using graphlab that you have to pay for after free licence expiry when everyone else teaches scikit learn sklearn for good reasonthe tools used on this course are also not very goodeveryone else teaches using text editors  for a good reason you learn how to code properlythe lessons are also dry and there are far too many of them	0
absolutely one of the worst courses i am deleting it from my listno slides make it harder to follow	0
course content is ok but some lectors are really boring in explaining mathematical detailstasks are pretty easy and this is from algorithmic perspective because from programming there are almost nothing to doand overall it feels that there are not so much info as for  weeks course if it would cost lest than it would be ok but for  ive expected more	2
this course is the least content rich of the series so far seemed basic to me but maybe thats because my background is communication and content strategy	0
the class was ok this was the topic i was most excited to get to in the specialization so i started playing around with shiny slidify and other tools ahead of time because i had gained some basic familiarity with those packages this class was a bit of a letdown i was happy with the week on making r packages that was all new and fascinating if youre looking for something more advanced than a very basic overview you may want to look elsewhere	2
the course is outstanding in building character and modelling one attitude toward societyit help me a lot to be a better and effective person in society	4
the videos could be more informative and longer	3
most of the interviews were very interesting and useful addition to the lectures prof david francis germano questions were of good standard	3
more programming details should be included	2
poorly designed videos too long and confused	0
its a very introductory class only works for newbies of digital marketingmaybe its a good start point	1
great overview of strategy and how he word as well as its meanings have used over time	4
excelent course even if you have prior knowledge in ml it is worth doing programming assignments could be less guided though no reason do decrease ratings for this	4
i learned so much from this course i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a quick introduction to typography the instructor does an excellent job in both explaining and illustrating topics	4
useless the information content is close to zero just some blahblah and a long tutorial to install software	0
they say that if you dont have anything good to say its better not to say anything at all	0
only  minutes of video average per week really nice pleasant video but dont expect to learn how to solve the problems because there is little connection from the problems to the videosteaching assistants are hard working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do thingsvery little in the way of effective educational designbut they do create useful questions to answer if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instructionthe estimate of time required is woefully inadequatethe best thing you can do is lookup brandon rhodes on youtube he will actually explain pandas expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions use the course forum extensively  only there will you get a hint of how to do what they askgoogle and stack overflow thats their extensive list of references	2
loving it so far	3
it is really not for beginners the first week was ok  but we didnt spend much time coding then it was really difficult to follow	1
not very useful	0
hello unfortunately  just my opinion  not enough information about r tests and program what is this basic details for testing and code no details for macusers videos are to short to understand details and goals what i will learn how to use mathematic formulas if i could  i wanna leave this course thanks for understanding	1
this course offered nothing significant or new to anyone who has spent any time around business or government negotiations it really seems as though the instructor either assumes all of her students are completely inept or that because it is a free course that producing a reasonably viable product is not necessary	0
i learned more about project management from a different course which was about the business of games	2
excessively short course	2
should contain more details	2
the resolution of the video is not clear and also audio is not clear but the contents are good	2
this class does not go in depth enough for debutant people to figure out how to do the assessments or gain a good understanding of what is covered	0
seemed very basic at the beginning and then got a lot more involved in the last week i felt there was a lot of code samples to be pulled from almost so much so that you barely needed to write javascript more like copy and paste class was really easy i did learn about some major topics of the dom structure of html so that was great	2
this course is a total disappointment in comparison with all the other courses from this specializationthe quality of the course is very poor reading links are outdated and not available assignments are superficial tests consist of questions which do not make you think but make you memorize unnecessary numbers lectures are presented poorly they are read from the screen and you feel that attitude very often they include videos from readingthe course feels like an outdated or a class for mentally defective read about it then well repeat the same in the lectures then youll pass the test with the same kind of questions then well ask you to make an assignment answering the question that has already been discussed three times once again do not bother to think just repeat because thats what necessaryi struggled to finish this course only because of the whole specialization and a great job which has been done by all the other professors	0
its really very useful curse thanks for taking me in this course	3
a very interesting and basic introduction to financial markets that is suitable for anybody for coursera the course has been shortened compared to the original version taught at yale in some places unfortunately it seems like too much is left out	3
it is easy to follow it should be a  week university course but imho it should cover more about the data type problems that can arise with r loose data types it is focusing too much on the code profile concept without leaving interesting knowledge about that it should cover better the native ideaimplementation about computation as single instruction multiple data which is not well covered in the end this is one interesting aspect of the language that makes it useful for data science	2
this course was super boring and the video lasted so much time	2
this should not be a course its just introduction and should be condensed to one video and a handout with pointers to those who need more specific and detailed instructions for setting up their computers this is not a learning course all they teach you how to install git r and rstudio and they take money for this if you want to say you completed the course highly unethical practice in my opinionthe surveys are stupid too they dont distinguish between those who completed but not earned any credentials and those who didntin my opinion this is a very dumbed down version of an introduction to a data science course and not a cours in itself definitely not worth  weeksa much more valuable course is stanfords machine learning where you can actually learn something and dont force you out of evaluation if you dont pay	0
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment	0
this should be at most a  week course that is free half the course is installing rstudio and signing up for github the other half of the course is simply learning what each course down the pipeline is about those lectures could just be tacked onto the description of each course and you would get the same thing out of iti think this course would be improved by more instruction on what git is and how to use it and maybe going over some fundamental statistical topics	2
really good	3
im confused as to why there was so much emphasis on domain knowledge rather than a good solid foundation of basic principles im also failing to see how much of this is going to be applicable to future installments of this course as a starter for a java course i am worried	1
the best ever course	4
it is a very clear picture of a global issue sustainability	4
very practical	4
it was a interesting course	2
too hard for a beginner	0
the first  weeks have too many videos which make it difficult to follow this breaks the flow of the lectures and makes a lot of unuseful repetitionsthe slides only have words and are hard to follow no graphs or illustrations this means that you rely on the voice of the lecturer to guide you which is difficult sometimesfurthermore the code presented is not run live and results are often lacking which makes comparison with my own results hard to dosummary not that its a bad course swirl is a great tool just look for another course thats easier to follow	1
excellent video materialsone of the best classes on this subject but there has been no support missing and incorrect spreadsheets for assignments and no response from tas for days at a time this could be a great class if they get the bugs fixec	1
materials video and written only partially prepare the student for the quizzes and course projects	2
i like the course it helped me a lot in structuring my knowledge about emails business communication	4
very intesrting and welldeveloped	3
good introduction into the applications of d printing	2
i liked the course nonetheless i liked we had previous exercises to prepare to each evaluation	3
as a web developer i found that i already knew about  of the information presented the final  i could have found faster via a google search than by watching the lectures it was also a little strange to me that the course began with a segment on job opportunities and how to begin a career in seo i feel this would have made more sense after an introduction to the materiali also did not like that the free version of the course did not allow you to complete any of the assignments as this has not been the case in my other coursera courses not only were you unable to assess your comprehension of the material because of this but also it meant receiving annoying emails and notifications that i had not completed the module in other classes i have taken there are additional resources and content for the paid users as it stands im really glad i did not pay for this classi will continue to the next seo course because im hoping that it will delve more into the technical aspects of optimization but i am not pleased with the format so far	1
hoped for more exercises	3
good information overall but the peer graded assignment at the end is poorly designed and seems unnecessarily arbitrary not a clear value add over a final exam format to justify waiting days for someone to grade your work instructions for this assignment are poorly written and unclear  for example completely not clear you are asking us to identify a primary key versus stating there is no primary key etc	2
i expected much more the course material is really weak did not improve my knowledge about cyber security i am very disappointed also cos i payed  dollars to a certificate i do not recommend this course	0
really good level of detail versus other courses and difficult questions which really test your understanding of the subject matteron the downside some links were not added to supplementary reading which is a shame as these resources really help with your understanding	2
very interesting subject nevertheless the training course material is too theorical	2
thanks professor charles	4
i spent a year coding working on other programming languages and came back to this one a second time i had the same exact learning issues as before luckily i had a better background but still had trouble going from lecture to exams swirl is great	2
for the third course in the python specialisation this is a very basic  weeks the assignments are repetitive and you are pretty much spoon fed everything if you are looking for a challenging course this is not for you	1
excellent course interesting topics the instructors all teach in a clear but professional way thank you professor richmond for spending so much time helping us on the discussion boards in the future i would love it if there was more recommended reading and not just strictly related to the topics in the lectures thank you very much	4
hated the course and the content i truly regret investing my money on this course	0
a really helpful and detailed course you really can go trough it for four hours and gain quite useful knowledge about the punctuation and the correct way of structuring your essay the only recommendation i would have is to give up on the adobe flash technology for the practice tests and use java script and simple htmlthanks for the course	3
very good	4
in my opinion the professors accent and speaking style makes the content difficult to understand in addition the course does not seem to have been properly designed	1
intresting sinds my volunteering job with coderdojo belgium and my teaching job in th grade i only expected more excercices	2
too much stuff is taught without teachings the basics of the language	2
very poor instructions and not enough theory	2
the first courses are greatunfortunately the course that covered the installation week   create your first basic application with android studio got me lost	1
this is an awesome course with great stuff for learning and practical graphs concept in programming with some useful algorithms like a	3
 sometimes the audio of the recordings is poor making it difficult to listen for nonspeakers of spanish the translations are not so great and sometimes lack proper grammar or are almost literal translations of the spoken spanish version this makes the subject matter although very interesting very difficult to fully grasp this also occurs in the quizzes causing me to either misunderstand or not understand the questionsoverall it is a very interesting course but the execution is not up to standard it could be improved by updating the audio recordings and correcting the translations for the subtitles	2
excellent course for those taking the first steps into hi	3
i do like the course but coursera has disabled discussion forums for this course which makes it impossible for the students to interact and find answers to problems or discuss possible errors in the example code student interaction is one of the strongest aspect of moocs without it this might as well be nothing more than a series of youtube videoshad coursera not discontinued the discussion forums id have given this course four or five stars	1
disappointing just brushed the surface of most of the topics felt a bit too much like an ad for pwc or story telling about client engagements content was lacking	0
this is an absolutely fantastic course very enjoyable and engaging	4
is a very very boring curse dont recommend anyone please for your good at everyboduy else kill this course dont embarrass yourself and the universities that represents	0
a very articulate orientation which meticulously arouses interest about different corners of data science	3
difficult to follow	1
great coursehowever some lectures were reused from another specialization and they didnt fit well on this version	3
while the content of the course is interesting and useful the delivery desperately needs improvement the professors speak in an extremely monotonous way making it seem like they are reading their lines from behind the camera just awful and makes it really hard to follow and stay interested and connected with the topic even when youre passionate about the subjecti would rather have the course in italian and read the subtitles if that means a more energetic delivery	1
on the positive side i emphasise the importance of bringing this topic to a coursera course also the readings were important and added value to the learning experienceon the other hand there are  in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience first there are some audio issues in the videos second the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments if there are required readings some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings this way students had an incentive to go over those readings but the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors  the one that presented most of the videos was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors rephrasing stopping changing speed i found it very very difficult to follow along what he was saying i had to focus only on the slides otherwise i would get distracted i think it is ok to be nervous or at ease but the team should alerted him to this and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced qualitya minor thing i would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection i think the video issues that ive mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstreamthis is my opinion hope it will help you for future improvements of the course andor other offeringsricardo oliveira	2
from my past experience i know its not easy for people to take suggestions but i still want to have a try this timei had high hopes for this course but i am quite disappointed i think dr peng needs to improve his teaching skills good teaching is clear concise and right to the point so please slow down speak dont mumble programming is a practical skill so the best method to learn programming is to use stepbystep demos you can talk about a concept for  to  minutes but i still cant get it use a demo and i can get it right away dont just try to cover the materials so you think you have done the teaching try to understand how your students learn and make sure they really get it if you havent covered some concept dont assume your students will understand it by magica good teacher can make the learning experience effortless and fun a poor teacher makes it like a torture	1
unlike the previous course in this sequence this course provided little to no substantial information while i fully agree with the premise of the course the importance of leadership communication through storytelling this course presented no sources psychological research or evidence to defend its arguments it provided great lay advice with little to no research base i would not recommend this course for anything beyond casual reading it is not substantiated	1
the course was still useful and with new information but i really found it lacking cohesion with the overall specialization and with its own content	1
excellent teaching and material	3
anyway i can start to make music after this course	4
pathetic	0
in fact this is an inconsistent attempt of reimplementing previous frp course from the same authors frp course had many issues about homeworklectures being poorly related this one is even worse this is very frustrating as a topic itself is one of the most interesting ones in todays software engineering	0
it has to be reviewed	0
this course was heavy on data and light on implications and course corrections it would have been more helpful to outline the types of behaviors that make an individual fall into a specific category socially and how to change what your currently do to enhance your social likability	1
the course is interestingthe peerreview assigment and grading system is the weak park of this course  you are asked to do a prototype in one week that must be reviewed pretty epic from the other students for the highest grade	2
lousy courseboring teacher	0
i really like the lectures of this course but on the other hand this programming assignments arei am not able to see why using such a complicated main code template is useful to understand the principals of the finite element method i spend  hours for trying to install all the libraries and finding the correct header files of dealii and this visualization thing which is needed in the write_outputh file because otherwise you will not be able to compile the code this is not the first time i did installation of complicated code in unix and i know by heart this can be cumbersome sometimesbut why doing this for a simple programming assignment i started this course because i want to learn about finite element method and not how to install dealii software but exactly installing is what the first assignment is about it is not about coding what will be only a small fraction of the whole assignment thenand the next thing is there is not only one person facing this troubles there are quite a lot if you look in the discussion forumson the other hand if there would be sufficient help given for the installation it would be fine but it is notthe only help which is given are sending some links which is nice but links i can also watch by myselfso i really liked this course and found it interesting  or i still find it interesting  but i dont see what learn effect i should have from messing around with those dealii libraries	0
i was really hoping to complete the data science specialization but i have found the first couple of courses to be not very cohesive this course in particular was ok but lectures and application projects and assignments had such a wide gap between them i found that i was mostly teaching myself	1
great course but can be tasking for english speakers	3
the course content is very good but the professor is not charismatic and in overall it is not well produced as other courses ive taken	3
i like the casebased approachthis course gives a nice albeit shallow overview i dont like that one professor uses this course to push his startup by asking students to use graphlab a more commonly used library would have been a much better choice parts of the course feel like a getting started with graphlab tutorial	1
too abstract and unroganized	0
with all respect professor if you are reading all our comments i think you are a really smart person and you should take all the negative feedback from your students here positively and constructively as having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students personally i feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your studentsaudience use more simple examples draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about what are we going to achieve in each of the topics what are we going to look at and what methods availablefor foundation class like this i think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us the objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge get us interested in this subject and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge as when we are interested for sure we will go and do more research and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levelsthe key point here is speak to the level of your audience even if you are able to talk everything above the sky and up to the moon if no one able to understand you it is useless	1
really lke ths straght forward engaging introducton to programing	4
my programming and algorithm design greatly improved after taking this course through the advanced problem sets i was able to appreciate the finer aspects of efficient algorithm designing and im sure that ill improve a lot with courses to comei would definitely recommend this course to any one who wishes to improve hisher skill set for designing efficient algorithms	4
i enjoyed the lectures but i felt they didnt go into enough details on analysis of sequence data the final project was considerably harder than the material taught in the class and problems with the course eg the final exam file not being available had obviously not been fixed since the last version of the course a fell i now have a good basic understanding of python but not enough to do any real analysis fantastic course mentorta	2
not for ones who can google	2
all homework were to modify from an existing code and all lessons were skimming on indexes i learned less than other courses from this series	2
unfortunately the material and lectures of this course fell short of my expectations lectures dont follow a logical path and are all over the place and some concepts are not expanded as required overall i believe they need to improve how the content is presented and how its applied in a real world context	0
only an introduction which was also not proper	0
greed rules previously the course was free including the quizzes to check whether one learned something or not now you have to pay  just to check your learning progress i do not need a certificate just learning for myself	0
having only video lessons is really heavy and time consuming id like to have all the material in written format too so that i can come back to skim trough how some modal or tense works now if i wanted to recap something i had to guess the video and then watch it just to notice it wasnt the right one super difficult having all the material in well formatted written format i could been able to easily skip the parts i already know now it want possible and i had to spend way too much time for simple thingsalso more practices would have been nice now there was like three quiz questions per topic thats not enough for proper learning most of the gamified practices outside coursera were good though i encourage you to have more links outside coursera and point out material where i could deepen my knowledge about the topicalso some times this course didnt explain differences between different ways of saying the same thing it confused me a lot as i wasnt sure why one would say it in one way and other in some other way if different ways of saying same things do not have any difference in meaning nor emphasis on different things it definitely should be mentioned too as it is also very valuable informationthis course has lots of potential and the structure was good but due to lack of good written material i cant recommend this to any of my friends 	1
this course is absolute garbage you get no feedback on your quizzes or assignments and the professor is one of the most boring ive ever seen its absurdly frustrating to repeatedly fail without any feedback as to why youre failingthe lectures are clearly from a math perspective as the prof simply draws what hes talking about on the slides his hand writing is poor and he does a lackluster job of explaining what exactly hes doingfinally pure lecture with no notes is almost impossible to learn as theres nothing to read and studyid rate this course a  take the course on itunes from caltech instead	0
love this course never learn more than from this course	4
i was satisfied by the content and the pace of learning	4
the course starts very promising but it gets worse week after week culminating on a barely understandable week about dynamic programming thats when i gave up and decided to write this review instead with just one assignment missing to complete the coursesome of the teachers arent native english speakers which is fine but their english is very hard to understand i found myself having to watch some portions of the videos over and over again in order to understand what was being said i tried reading the transcripts instead but the theyre even worse it seems that they were automatically generated from the videos thus suffering with the poor pronunciationthe teachers use mathematical sophistication that feels unnecessary but to be fair they do mention it on the faq as part of the necessary background however even though its an online course they barely use any teaching method besides very raw slides some dry mathematical proofs and someone speaking about the content the only resources offered to help learning are a few open source visualizations i expected much morethe only good aspect from this course are the assignment checkers which allow you to write your solutions in multiple languagesi deeply regret the money and time i spent on this course	1
it is a very helpful course to start learning korean it starts from hangul alphabet to some daily life conversation	4
informative and sometimes fascinating	2
thank you guys course is very good im now really excited to work on project that use machine learning hope i find one quite soon providing the course for free is a really awesome thing to do i appreciate that but there seems to be fee charged for certification after completing the course 	3
very basic we need sequels	1
should just be called introduction of java for absolute beginners i dont recall anything for android about the codingsome of the lecturers are so bad at speaking that its painful to listen to i really expected better	1
so i will give one star because the title is misleading i was expecting a course about responsive ui for website but is yet again a basic introduction to html css and javascript	0
this course is	0
paying for course just to learn how to loop and make if else statements i dont think this is the best way to learn java	0
i enjoyed the start up course and look forward to more but am battling to figure out how to signup for the next step all roads seem to force me back to the toolkit	2
a nice introduction not formal enough	2
i recommend this course to the immature seo learners it helps to establish a fundamental understanding of how seo has evolved over the past decade the second half of the courses emphasises on the algorithm updates explained in a very clear manner with the assignment being well designed	3
simply the best course ive ever taken	4
wonderful insight and delivery by instructor visual material very helpful for comprehension well done	4
it became difficult to follow near the end despite watching all the videos and student curated notes i feel like i need more guidance during the actual assignments i do something wrong but am not sure where to reference to fix my code despite using internet resources it would be nice if there were hints along the way for ways to fix the code	3
module  is good will see and rate later	3
the lectures are good but in the assignments he asks for tasks that are not at all explained in the videos for a beginners course it is way too difficult and time consuming	1
excellent i learn some new algorithms on graphs	4
great course	3
it is not a recommended course when they explain something they assume that we are expert and we know all what they are talking about they need to have statistics experts which is not mentioned in course prerequisitei recommend to review the material and to review the purpose of this course	0
if you are considering this specialization i would recommend the andrew ng course instead and the main reason is that it isnt depend on proprietary ml framework despite the good lectures the assignments dont help you develop the knowledge required for ml developer roletaking in consideration the permanent postponing the courses delivery from summer  to summer  finally the most interesting part of the specialization was cancelled im completely disappointed with the specialization learning expirience	0
this course is a requisite for anyone wanting to learn and apply frameworks for client side web development what takes this course to stars is the instructor jogesh muppala aside from his humour he prepares the content of this course in such an unambiguous and clear format that i think the material would be enjoyed by even the most diehard nontechy there is a wide assortment of coursera experiences but i would say that this should be the type other instructors aspire to duplicate	4
one of the best courses ive taken on coursera all of the videos were clearly explained had detailed graphics and were short enough to get the point across but not too long that i would get bored and uninterested excellent work on this series and the cooking videos at the end a wonderful bonus	4
starts off informative and then becomes very basic it felt like it was more for informing families struggling with nutrition than for informative education on health and foodthe interview with michael pollan that was woven in to each lesson were the main reason to finish the course	2
a little touch on the basic concepts and a detailed step by step tutorial on applying ml using python packages this could serve as a good complement to the beloved stanford ml course on coursera for someone who is just getting started with python i think this course would be significantly more useful if the packages used are pandas and scikitlearn since those are more heavily adopted in the industry the course is well organized and the programming examples are fun this is a great introduction course to ml and i do expect highly of the subsequent courses in this specialization	4
sells too much google and do not explain important things	1
the videos lacks clarity not loud enough and at instances its ungrammaticalcertainly there always will be scope of improvement and although it was moderately enlightening thank you for producing this course quite credibly flexible	2
it was really helpful and i really feel like i learned a lot cant wait to start the next course	3
horrible experience as a student no moderator or the faculty replies to your queries the instructor has just left the course to take its own accord it is frustrating to get such a response when you have paid a hefty much for the course	0
nothing new	0
 way too much time is devoted to introducing definitions and way too little time is given for student practicing and review  the presenters accent is constantly impeding instant recognition of what hes saying the subtitles sometimes dont accurately represent what hes saying sometimes there are misspellings  which makes it even harder to know what hes saying this student was inundated with formulas that needed to be practiced  and i didnt even have time to write them down 	1
a waste of money only  but it was so terrible i did not even want to finish it and apparently i waited too long to get a refund as well never again	0
andrew is a good teacher	4
this course is a very enjoyable tour of introductory game theory covering several different general types of games and a wide variety of examples taken from realworld situationsthe main results of the theory are stated and demonstrated by examples rather than proved if youre looking for a proof of nashs theorem you wont find it here but you should definitely look at his original onepage paper from  which is freely available online some advanced topics are also briefly mentioned so that interested students have the option to look them up for themselvessome may find the use of formal mathematical notation offputting so youll want to be comfortable with inequalities linear equations and the basic notation of set theoryin the discussion forums for my session the course mentor was very helpful and supportive of all the students some feedback on error corrections and suggestions was posted to the forums including a summary list posted in week  which will hopefully reach one of the instructorsoverall i highly recommend the course and am looking forward to part 	4
short of content and engagement	1
this course isnt what i anticipated i see where many topics related to marketing in a digital world but most if any had a indirect relationship	2
very shallow coverage doesnt have the scope to be an entire course	0
too long	0
it assusmes quite a lot of things about web programming and the assignments were too complex to just practice what we should learn in an introductory course	0
very knowledgeable educatorscourse is given in a qa style which is very very good for a web based course since the questions often are exactly what i want to askhowever think the course can still be improved especially in the following aspects examples in the course are not thought through ahead instead educators came up with them on the spot that way it may not be the best example to convey the message plus the videos are made unnecessarily long in this way think its good that for a programming course to show real time programming sometimes but to do this all the time is a bit too much and therefore inefficient comparing to some other courses think this one could really benefit if the educators could give some thought on how to teach especially to think from a student perspectivefor example about the capability of overwriting and defining new operators the example given was to define a knife operator and to overload plus operator to stew vegetables both examples do not make much sense to me although i did understand that its nice that one can define hisher own operationoperator when the examples came i actually got confused  how do i stew vegetables with code some of the quiz questions i dont find useful for this course i need lots of time to complete the quiz in contrast to other coursera courses i did this is because i need to actually read the documentation in order to answer the quiz questions since they are really in depth in this way to do the quiz is actually the way to learn but some questions are quite artificial for example theres a multichoice question about what are the different ways one can find help finally i find the video and the quiz very abstract that its very difficult to follow without making a line of code myself also it is not clear what the educators expect as a prerequisite for taking this course sometimes things are explained as if the listeners have no programming background at all some other time a concept is explained so fast i wonder whether i should have known objectivec in order to follow this course	0
good intro to the topic i suggest reading the suggested books and blogs to fully appreciate it	3
i cant have my certirficate and already i pay for it	0
before discussing genetic mutations occurred in alzheimer disease that mentioned when discussing ais i think some refreshment about protein synthesis and the normal pattern that if disturbed by certain ways as mutations causes particular diseasessome arrangements of material needed to prevent information overlappinginteresting courses go onthanks for your efforts dear professors	2
materials not well prepared	2
a great introduction course however the assignments are not challenging enough	4
it was an amazing experience	2
this is a brilliant course starts from the basics of object oriented programming covering all the topics in intermediate details also the final assignment helps you to add additional features and test your creativitya must for beginners and a good course to review the fundamentals of ooad	4
not enough material covered to make it worth the cost	1
great intro for beginners to big data world the pace of course is perfect	4
apart from the book the courses does not offer me anything no videos no active forum no explanation also the assessment is not interesting and there is no much information in the teaching material in order to be able to do the assessmenti am very disappointed with this specialization	1
so many equations presented without explaining why these things work or how they are derived im having a hard time seeing the relevance also i learned a lot of these statistics in college and the explanations provided in these lessons actually confused me about things i already know very disappointed in this course especially since part  of the specialization was so good	1
the idea of having support with the videos does not work with this course also the exams do not match at all with the information provided the anwers to the exams are so relative or subjective and thats a problem for those who does not domain english very well just like me	1
prof harris continues to make everything crystal clear the forums dont behave as i think they ought but i assume thats a coursera wide issue and not particularly to do with this class this course is really wonderful and i appreciate so much the opportunity to be a part of it i have posted about it on my geek pages and also on facebook thank you prof harris and uci	4
the content is rich but the way of teaching is dull	3
very basic and the lectures are short in duration not what i expected from this course	1
the material could be exciting but the presentation is dull the pass mark on the quizzes is around  as these courses are supposed to be for interest why do you need  to pass	1
you do not know what you are getting into until you take the first class what happen to the delete button on the classl	0
so far the course appears to be very good but the request for an upgrade after every video becomes more and more annoying as the number multiplies	3
thanks for the course butyour quizzes is real pain some random variable could cause wrong resultyour should follow how it is implemented in lectures in stupid way like efficient way when you build hash map n instead of nbluej sucks you make a lot of clicks to run method use some decent ide like eclipse or idea	0
th lecturer could be a little more engaging and the materials used during classes if made available would help following it better by replicating the examples being shown	3
the course is too some extent useful it indeed spreads useful techniques and concepts in learning one thing i do not like is the testing questions some of these questions are poorly designed using intuition or commonsense is already enough to solve them	2
unfortunately not very engaging	0
the course is well made unfortunately you will find at least one minor or fatal error in every video as well as quizzes it also doesnt cover all the important subjects so i would not call it an fe exam review course as the title might be very misleading the course is good for reviewing the mentioned subjects but dont depend on it as your sole source of review	2
very good explanation useful and straight forward knowledge omits advance mathematics and explains the basics and how to use them the homeworkprojects are also useful and interesting	4
big part of the course videos devoted to history of how the technology was developed not much technical information about the technology itself	0
nice introductory course but too much dependence on graphlab create	2
this course is really useful	4
this course is way too much concentrate on studies for students not well correlate with studies for everybody	2
very very good needs some clean up in the powerpoints and perhaps a bit more elaboration with some concepts the quizzes were a bit tricky where some of the questions hinged on a single word or phrase in the lecture	3
introduced too many tools in a single course javascript css jquery is very vast and it is not possible to learn everything in one course they should have been introduced one by one it took a lot of time for me to capture what the video taught i had to do a lot of self learning	1
cannot understand the diction	0
exercises should be better designed and i think that first week of this course and the whole previous one are too basic they could be assumed for  of people and i think it would be a good idea to create an optional preparation module containing them that would save time and perhaps open opportunities for more advanced material to be included	2
interesting course i recommand it to everyone who wants to learn more about buddhism or juste everydays life psychology	4
very poor assignments consist of transcription of formulae given in lectures and then manually searching the parameter space for solutions	0
i would not recommend this course the content is very relevant to the subject matter however the lectures are much longer than they need to be and filled with unnecessary commentary the instructor often verbally discusses the statistical formula with a few bullets on a slide with the focus on himself the delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walkthrough of the equation at hand	1
 is way too much to spend just to learn how to install a couple pieces of software and sign up for a github account the entire course should have been the first week of the following course	0
im not a teacher but i took this course to gain a better understanding on how light works to try and use it to create original visual designs since im a graphic designer its just great how this course has been arranged to be so short and simple even for nonteachers	4
bad instructor	0
a nice if a little basic introduction to the raspberry pi single board computer and to controlling the raspberry pi using python	3
the tutorials are outdated i could not install all the software needed to complete the course nor do i understand what they are used for too bad looks like a great course	0
the course is well prepared thought through coherent and structured in a way that it supports the contenthowever it felt very much like being in an advertisement program for pmbok this feeling was supported by the unavailability of all course materialsthroughout the course the pmbok guide was included as the suggested reading the pmbok materials were featured in each and every lecture and the guidebook was extensively presented and recommended in an extra video this gives the impression that the course content cannot be sufficiently understood without this literature therefore i would expect the specific recommend chapters to be made available for the participants of the course especially since this is a paid course	3
thanks for the course a few things that can be improved the video material was very short i expected same amount of teaching like homework but its more like  minutes versus  hours every week as a result its mostly googling and copypasting code which im very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my longterm memory probably next time i will need to look it up again id prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum  as an experienced programmer but being new to python i found it difficult to load the data i was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csvfilenamecsv instead i tried to load the files from my local drive which worked but not for the grader then i tried to submit it offline which also failed i wasted half a day on this i suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work in particular in how to load data  the feedback from the grader is usually not telling much it was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome i think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions first few rowscolumns would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering	1
good but not latest	2
i am so eager to be part of the class thank you for this coursera	4
scattered lectures that are hard to follow and choppy	0
too much practices and industries but a little about the theory	2
great course to get an introduction into the world of finance and its multiple faces	2
lots to learn and it was presented in a very easy to follow format	3
very helpful	4
i think the course is very good but the peer review grading should be improved sometime people have to wait for more than  weeks to get their assignment graded or they dont know whether they will get the grade thanks	3
the material is very interesting but with only  minutes of video a week it is really not enough	1
really good course just like all the previous courses in the specialisation the professor took time to explain and introduce important concepts in javascript programming	4
it is a good intro course to get set up with everything you may need for future courses but its not necessary if you are already a little familiar with github and r	2
the quiz in this course is not helping this learning experience to be positive	0
thanks so much awesome course	4
in my view this course is well structured and it focuses on business topics i highly recomend do it im an spanish native speaker and in my opinion with bb level you can follow it without any problem	3
the information was interesting but sort of long in fact i started this so long ago that i dont remember most of what was said only that it was long i did enjoy the first course americas written constitution but someone was paying attention then and it was on the older format so it was better i rate the course so poorly however because of the total lack of staff involvement and the worthless peer review papers i have a huge problem with the peer review process it is of no value and should be banned be that as it may however it takes weeks to get reviews and there is no one from the course staff paying any attention to the course there is not one posting from course staff in the forums there has been no response to any of the so called comment on this assignment messages ive been leaving since july there has been no response to an email supposedly sent to the instructor on my behalf by the coursera help desk weeks ago it is obvious that the instructor has abandoned this course if no one is going to pay attention to it it should be taken down if you just want the information watch the videos but dont expect anything else including any response whatsoever from this course ive wasted too much time on this im done	0
i found this class to be fascinating my only regret is that its over	4
it can improve a lot	1
the irony of the fact that a course that was meant to teach how to appropriate evaluate adult learners was full of quizzes that were riddled with guess what im thinking short answer questions and multiple choice questions with  or   correct answer was not lost on me i ended up leaving the course during week three after issues with a quiz that was described in the forums as impossible its too bad  the course description was very promising	0
just as the amy blooms course this course has no descriptive arch and one is left to try and grasp the teaching points in a flood of reference material teach theory in a clear structure first please then provide reference see brando skyhorse course very structured	2
excellent review of various visualization techniques	4
great course for basics	3
this was a great course  only suggestion would be to add more acronym definition information for the layperson like me 	3
not much interesting plus low level of difficulty	0
professors caffo and leek go way too fast and are completely monotonous the examples they use assume we know basic stats when likely most of us are a bit rusty	1
found difficult to use semantria and ibm bluemix they were not user friendly and the videos were too limited and did not show how to use the rest its a shame that we are given  months to use but no tools to take advantage of it	3
i categorize this course in the beginner level not intermediate	0
thank you very much mr white and team the course is a really jewel mr white broadly shows different pathways and amplitudes about our brain and it composition in many aspects biologic anatomic physiologic cognitive indeed it is a complete and unique class also mr white teach all this complex stuff with extraordinary quality in different scenarios lab room his house in a forest unfolding new approaches however the quizzes are very very hard and detailed but they inspire our study best regards from brasil and thank you again mr white his team and coursera	4
the javascript section was very good and helped me develop my programming skills i really like the seven step approach and using it work through the exercises the html and css sections were not very useful though	3
i did not find this helpful for a complete beginner i will try an alternative course	1
course material was interesting but very rudimentary the courses biggest challenge was understanding its spoken english i do not recommend this course	0
really bad course badly taught strange choice of assignments and quiz questions unfortunately i did the free trial and coursera didnt process my cancellation so that i had to pay for a whole month for thiscomplete waste of time and money	0
fresh and with basic concepts well explained	4
pretty good	2
im giving just a single star i started this course with high hopes bailed after the third quiz as i wasnt learning anything except how to pass the quiz sorry but this was a major letdown to myself and two other colleagues who all signed up to take it together we all bailed	0
the course is well structured and well explained	4
this course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package but suffers from some problemsthe lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments the assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky as a result every week i spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants instead of actually learning pandas i managed to pass this course with what i know is subpar code but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignmentsthe course has potential but as it is now i will continue this specialisation	2
i do not find very interesting this course too many interviews it could works for the first course but not for the second i was expecting to have more technical material and lessons	0
not well designed and the professor hard to follow	1
this is a good course with incredibly amazing stuff regarding the topics	3
very informative	3
the course material and videos are very good however i would prefer that comments about your work be emailed directly to the student so that they are more likely to read them i found it to easy to just move on and not really look for the comments on my work	2
i have an interest in both buddhism and psychology so being able to undertake a course that brings both together has been very enjoyable and i feel i have gained a lot from it	4
as a standalone course this would be very good the presenter is engaging and clearly knowledgeable and the treatment of the course subject is thorough and welldesigned grounding ux design in rigorous statistical analysis is importantbut as a component of the interaction design specialisation it was much too long nine weeks as long as the previous three courses combined and the coursework was uninteresting long sequences of statistical tests with strange names and very different to the creative and interactive assignments in the other courses it very quickly turned into a demoralising death march for meas part of the specialisation this course needs to be slimmeddown radically and perhaps complemented by other analytical approaches to ux and interaction design in its current form the inclusion of this course in the interaction design specilisation is represents an error of judgement	0
good course i would request that the instructors work through modules in real time that are similar to the quizzes	2
the course has a good content i wish there was an active participation by the mentors on the discussion forum	2
i wish the chinese characters were provided for all the vocabulary and example sentences taught	1
the information is probably great but the instructor speaks way too slowly in the videos and its very difficult to listen to i switched to reading it as a transcript but that generates as a txt file which is also very difficult to read as its not broken into paragraphs	1
a good intro to the tools required for a data scientist however could cover the usage of the terminal and rstudio better	1
wonderful course wonderful speaker	4
good explained course with interesting information about processes and practices in agile not too detailed but can give you an overall overview of what a process implies and what are the general practices used in software	3
really bad course they dont explain the concepts clearly the quizzes ambiguously ask things not seen in the videos and the instructor introduces equations without further explanation the course autonomous navigation for flying robots edx is much better	0
good for the beginner who knows nothing about programming and just have litter knowledge about basic components of computer this course is not recommended for it professionals may be other courses in this specialization may be effective for them	3
the javascript part of the course was to difficult for me i didnt understand enough i would like to see more tutorial	0
the teacher of this course talks toooo fast  im for example a french educated student so i prefer to take courses with a teacher who talks in a comprehensive way in which i can understand everything he says in order to proceed in my work and then to benefit everything in this courseconcerning the quiz in the all of the quiz there is questions not related to what already said from the teacher or in the articles required to read i red the articles coupes of time but in a specific questions the answers it seems that we should answer from our own memory because badly its not mentioned in any article or in the video of the teacherthanks	2
i am a bit disappointed by this course i was expecting a more fast paced course with more information regarding angular unfortunately in the videos there is a lot of time spent on unnecessary details and reading out loud the source code the exercises are quite basic and they did not pose real challenges  except for errors coming from mismatched packages or mistakes in configuration files also i think that the level of support provided by the mentors of this course is lacking mentors are quite absent and very late in providing any help in the forums so the students have to kind of counsel one another  that is sometimes good but a proper class also requires a good level of supervisionall in all i think this is an ok course that is mostly geared to the uninitiated it needs some serious work to make it a great course	2
i love the content overall however im very disappointed that there are no video lectures at all ironically i could find some old video lectures of this course on youtube the difficulty of this course warrants video lectures to convey many concepts and techniques such as the fitch systemhopefully you can add video lectures back to this course	2
very boring lectures expected a lot more from something like pwc doesnt worth it at all didnt learn anything new	0
this course is nicely organized and has manageable readings  videos the video quality could be better its very very basic information about research it might be useful to someone who does not know anything about it at all the title might lead one to expect that methods of research such as qualitative quantitative and mixed method would be explored rather this course is a general overview of what research is	1
assignment  was a bit confusing	3
loved every minute of it	4
this is a bait and switch you must purchase the course even though parts are free its really not	0
i enjoyed the course and its interactive nature	3
i dont want to be mean but the first week was terrible i was expecting what it said advanced neurobiologyi feel bad giving this review im just dropping the course	0
gives perspective to the decisions people take	3
the course is effectively a tutorial on how to use proprietary software to solve a range of machine learning problemsi liked the fact that the course covered a wide range of problems quickly there were however two issues that i did not like it is not well supported and given that the technology is proprietary there are few other places that offer support ie you cant just look at problems and solutions on stackoverflow to get insight into the tech for a course labelled as intermediate it presented very little detail most of the course was dedicated to explaining particular problems the solution to which was inevitably then you train this really clever oneline algorithm we have written for you and you query it for insights i felt a little cheated by this approach to a subject which should be really fascinatingwhile some of my concerns may be addressed in follow on courses i am left with little insight into what really lies ahead for example is this really an intermediate course what background do i really need will we ever get to the detail or will i always just be expected to call someone elses brilliant algorithm and accept the result	2
as someone whos new to the world of data science and doesnt have a university degree this course was very hard to get a good grasp onthats partly the cause of how the course was taught which was assuming you had all the knowledge at hand of all the stuff statistical inference is aboutfor people that are starting this stuff it might be nice to have a introductory course of statistical inference as i did not finish this course by just watching the course videos and additional information i had to look up additional resources which explained the material betterstill a big thank you for explaining statistical inference and opening my eyes regarding this topic it surely helped getting me to the next step in what data science is all about and makes it ever more interesting	2
i am sorry to say this but the tutorial could have been organzied in a much more serious wayi do not know how much time the professors have put on preparation but it gives me a sloppy impression the class carries the name of university of duke and  euros are charged so i think the learners would reasonably expect to see that the teacher puts lots of time to organize the course structure in order to efficiently give as much as information to the learners within limited timefor example i believe nobody would not say that the week  content on confusion matrix is very consistently explained and this is just one example	1
the instruction was nicely done the quizzes were a little much designed by gtas maybe	3
abstract when the assignment is related to psychology could you give us some not that professional articlesthe whole course is not designed in a clear and logic way overwhelmed with so many terms without clear explanations	0
the material and the lecture is not so engaging	0
there were the occasional moments when i had a hard time clearly understanding what the lecturer meant otherwise pretty good	3
great course	4
slightly better than the statistical inference course but many of the same technical and delivery defects persist with an otherwise high quality program i recommend reproducing the inference and regression lectures to increase the overall value of the curriculum	1
if i could i would rate it  starsdo not i repeat do not pay and enroll this course and you will be disappointed if you do there now you have been warnedthis part of the specialization has been put together in a haste without effort and absolutely without any care of teaching im completely shocked and disappointedin other wordsit is a complete joke and a sad excuse for a mooc shame on you university of torontoyes harsh words and heres whythe course description does not reflect the contents nor the final assignment face tracking thats pretty far from what i expected from this when i paid  for the specializationin total there is only minutes of video lectures really thats it its way too little for a capstone project coursestaff does not care about learnerss concerns zero effort to respond in the discussion forums it takes days before there is any response at allthe assignment descriptions and requirements are sparse and vague why are we doing face tracking when the description talks about location apis and putting it all together	0
i was studied about academic writing but did not finish still reading on recommend references academic writing tells about communicative what is the objective of the essay who is your audience academic writing looks about the flow and writibg style it avoid writing in short form like cant and ensures vocabulary	3
well presented with reasoned arguments some of the slides needed to be clearer especially the maps	3
great course 	4
not enough conversation on iot just in the last module way too much time spent on history that really doesnt matter and on stuff i can find on the net one module to run through all of these  circuit switching and packet switching computer telephony ss and then wireless would have been enough the remaining modules should have gone into the concepts of iot in greater detail and some high level technical info that someone who is just hearing about it can speak intelligently on it without having to develop my own dragon board next course	1
difficult to follow with no live coding	0
very clear and helpful	4
in my opinion a very basic course	1
you turn me on	2
the course is theoretical it would be better with more examples and case studies	1
has been postponed for months and its still only available for preview	0
an interesting course about some biological aspects in music as well as some comparing examples between cultural styles	3
great material to get you started with machine learning covers a bit of different ideas used in machine learning it definitely got me eager to learn more in the following courses	4
too many mistakes in the math i dropped after a week	0
good course and good teacher	4
about plotting in r not about generating real insights from eda	1
the studiant do himself the teacher	1
a bit thin on the psychology references are not hard to find and post in resources	1
ive done quite a few online courses over the past few years and i consider this is without doubt the poorest the lectures do not comprehensively provide the information needed to complete the assignments i think this is not just my opinion either as posts in the course forum suggest other participants have the same view the stated module completion times are wildly optimistic i only managed to complete the course by substantial independent research consequently i would not recommend this course	0
good intro very motivating	4
unacceptable assignments length the reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload it took me  weeks not  hours as tutor mentions to complete half of the second assignment and i am about to tell that i learnt nothing about mongodb the videos cover the very basics and in order somebody to complete the assignments needs searching in the internet the videos must change to include more details about the presented topici am about to drop out of the specialization only because the specific course	0
not everything is explained well so very challenging for someone with no prior coding experience	0
good for understanding the various types of neural networks but i had hoped to spend more time learning methods for optimizing model fitment	2
hard to follow ideas are not organized and are not well presented lecturer has many pauses that even on increased playback speed x are still distracting do not recommend	0
helloive completed  modules of the specialization successfully with excellent grades however the biggest challenge and disappointment was the capstone the case given is pertaining exclusively to the north american market students enrolling into the course are situated globally which makes it extremely challenging to gather data to understand and substantiate our work on the project several hours of extensive research yields no usable data which could provide a logical direction to the project reading material provided explains mainly the company profile a few links are blocked due to geographical restrictions reports that are available are to be purchased etc while the money invested is not refundable now however coursera with university team needs to seriously resolve this point all learning done through the course remains largely a theoretical knowledge if a student isnt able to apply it in hisher job	0
the instructor is not good and doesnt explain things clearly	1
clean and very understandable	4
an excellent course with rich pedagogy and informed insight into terrorism and counterterrorism easily one of the best courses on coursera	4
highly recommended	4
very clear and effective	4
great material some things i didnt know about disabilities and colleges however the presentation of the videos that were not of a guest speaker were poorly done the instructors sounded like robots and you could tell easily that they were just reading from a script	0
excellent course it is a very interesting and it combines the practice and theory perfectly	4
i just finished this course i want to give a frank feedback since i see a lot of untapped possibilities in this course on the strengths it began with a high note and got me glued with expectations and promises the instructor sounded extremely comfortable and confident with her subject and had a very calming and pleasant presence which helped establish a kind of remote trust on the improvement areas i however have a few to list for one the intensity rigour and tothepointedness of the content sharply fell after the first week having known about mindfulness metta meditations gratitude it became personally disappointing to me how this course conveyed so little about them and impacted so less than can be possible with the time and space alloted the framework which initially looked hopeful is perhaps not the best framework as much as is said about this not being spectator course because this format diluted the intensity and possibility of the course making it drag and bore towards the end i wish there were guest interviews of more experienced academicians than what happened here as interviews from which there was little to learn honestly this is my th of th course on positive psychology and this one will have to make many a fixes to any other that ive taken on coursera the course ended and i find myself not a tad upbeater or nourished or knowing something useful that i did not know already other than about vegas nerves which really did not make sense to end user who are here to know what and how to do things and feel better	1
dont take this course unless you have a programming background week  has a programming assignment that is way to advanced for students without any programming knowledge this assignment deals with functions where the code is complicated whats unfortunate is that you have to finish ever assignment including this impossible assignment for beginners to get recognition for the course i spent most of my time researching other sources for information because the lectures and the supplemental information given on a different site by the instructor which indicate knowledge that the lectures are insufficient give trivial examples when the programming assignments are anything but this course needs some serious adjustments either with the prerequisites needed for success in this course or with the material within the assignments themselves	0
a nice course for beginners that include basics of communication satellite segments and services please include slides when the course reruns in future and additional study resources for better understanding of concepts	2
the course is an advanced one and not really suggested for a beginner who would want to understand basic concepts also during the course the teaching was fast and there was lot of content to understand the practice programs contained lot of code which was confusing for a learner like me hence hoping that these shortcomings will be sorted out as and when the course profile is updated	2
this course is quite interesting for people who want to understand the development of the biggest network in the world  the internet understand the basics of networkrelated technology and security techniques for digital transaction however the review questions are fairly easy	3
the course seems more like a cutandpaste version of prof shillers financial markets course from yale open courses than a proper coursera mooc while the courses content is interesting and benefits a lot from prof shillers extensive scholarship and insight it could be improved along several waysi downloadable slides giving a comprehensive overview over prof shillers key points and power point slidesii a split screen with prof shiller on the right and the slide on the left side like in metrick and geithners global financial crisis moociii clearer presentation and explanation especially concerning mr redleaf but also for prof shiller he rambles quite a bit	1
great course with easy to follow videos and information	3
very theoretical and somewhat dry if you are interested in applied machine learning techniques for text retrieval and analysis this is not really the course to take gives a solid background though which in my opinion every aspiring data analyst needs	2
although the content was informational the presenters were uninteresting and made watching the videos hard to do	2
great starting point to learn machine learning difficult concepts were explained clearly	4
concise practical and covering all aspects of the markets 	4
description of assignment questions is not clear the expected answer from the questions are confusing	0
much more difficult assignments than taught in lectures	2
this course may be misleading aspiring data analysts and scientists it may give the false impression that with the tools learned here you will be able to analyze your data by yourself in fact you would be completely missing on large chapters of statistics and as a result you would often end up drawing wrong conclusions and believe you did a great job for example what is the point of giving you a single minutes video on how to do regression in tableau if you dont even know regression which is at least a oneterm course in graduate school and only after several other prior basic stats courses beware get a much larger background in statistics before applying anything you learn here in real life some minimal stats knowledge should be recommended as a prerequisite for this course or else you end up doing like those monkeys using a statistical software without really understanding what they are doing and drawing conclusions with blissful ignorance the problem is some of your audience will know and will notice more often than you might think and you will end up looking like an idiotsorry to be negative here but i think i owe you my costudent at least a warning do learn more stats elsewhere  good luck	1
the most important benefit of this course is the fact that it exists at present the course is mediocre to bad its educational value is low transcripts are disgusting they are not proofread omitted pats of sentences inconsistent english they almost completely obscure disrupt the sense of the presentation the course offers no slides i see obvious negligence in preparation of many lectures especially bad week threethe target audience for the course is professional biologist that are comparable with arithmetic and elementary algebra and can easily use an internet browserthe course contains numerous mistakes in particular the elementary formula dr cecilia lasser presented in her week  lecture on differential ultracentrifugation contains an errorthe lectures presented by nonnative english speakers are very difficult to understand because of poor  inconsistent englishplease make the lecture slide available for your studentsplease arrange a forum giving a possibility to ask a questions and get understanding of the material that remains unclearthe lectures on electron microscopy were very good  thank you johannathe lectures on afm was the only one that was just excellent  thank you dr shivani sharmaplease review the sequence of lectures i think the week  material may be moved to week 	1
brillantly designed courses	4
charles severence is amazing at what he does his method of teaching is second to none you remind me of my physics teacher back at high school he was very unorthodox in his teaching also so glad to see the course has gone to include all the material from his phenomenal book thank you and well done snape youre awesome	4
the course is very useful but the video lessons are very very short no enough examples forums also need presence of tutor for help  it would be of better value specially that comes from great professorsi really thank professors for their efforts	2
the content was simple and well organized out for a good introductory course the first step is often the most difficult one to take so its nice that they kept it easy	4
the professors view of plato is unique and interesting i would not recommend this as a first look at the dialogues however also it was difficult to see how the lectures connected to the remit of the course to teach reason and persuasion in platos view the course was more of a modern take on ancient questions	2
this introductory course is perfect it gives you time to think you dont have to spend too much time in order to understand the materialconcepts and it is selfsufficient i would suggest to set the playback rate at  since the teacher talks really slow in addition i would like to see the teacher talking like a human being instead of reading his notes in a black background but this is not super important for me all in all i totally recommend it	4
a good course giving a thorough understanding of the various types of renewable energy their issues and opportunities i cannot rate the course higher because some of it is so out of date it really needs to be redone the paris agreement wasnt mentioned some of the research is from the early s many of the lectures are at least  years old this is an area that is changing rapidly monthly and this course cant really be seen to be current any more particularly the politics section in week 	2
it was an interesting first experience with python but it seemed a little bit to easy for me actually i have been able to complete the hole course on one free day	1
nice course to start python	4
very good introduction to digital marketing	4
great course with awesome theory the quizzes are great and help to reinforce the conceptsimprovement area is availabililty of exercises in r  python and more programming assignments only  programming assignments are a shame	3
do not recommend very poorly explained refers to some concepts without introducing introduces others without explaining spends most of the time looking to the computer screen instead of toward you and reading the text instead of explaining in understandable manner	0
simple and good overview of data science	2
course is very basic  although contents are compact and informative	2
the first three classes in this certification were excellent this course was anything but that there seems to be a significant disconnect between the first three courses probability inference linear regression and the fourth course bayesian i do not have a strong statistics background but i felt the first three classes in the certification challenged me while providing an adequate level of support and thorough  articulate examples the pace was perfect yet with the fourth course i believe that either  there needs to be a bridge course that prepares you for the bayesian course or  the material needs to be taught at a slower pace with more specific and well presented examples  frameworks to work from although i was able to complete the course i will now have to find an alternative source to learn from in order to really understand bayesian stats	0
the course is well organized but i dont think it covered all the basics	1
the teacher goes very fast with the concepts without really spending much time on each of them it will be great if instead of covering all things in short amount of time the teacher could write r code using each type of function in console so that students know exactly what to expect	0
some of the data that gets pulled in from the qstk package is missing for the exercises it takes a bit of work around to get to the final data set	2
great information however the professor who is clearly a specialist just stood and read the lectures not as interesting as they could have been	1
nowhere near as useful as the first two courses the assignment did not feel particularly relevant to the bulk of the course materials	1
good course	1
very lengthy	1
incomplete and not clear extremely disappointed	1
great course learned a lot	4
that person should not teach nobody the person is not able to construct a sentence without denial and course has really little information but lots of empty talking	0
good course material	3
great introduction for programmingi think it can be improved with more logic content and assignments as well as some real cases such as real examples of text file parsing etc	3
this course provide useful tools to understand and evaluate growth strategy i recommend this course if you need to learn how to evaluate a growth strategy	4
interesting but too theoretic	2
excellent course very useful and relevant to people who are working in different fields but have to keep studying to keep up with the advances ill highly recommend this course for anyone struggling how to make better use of their time and how to get better results of study sessions	3
i thought the material was presented at an overly high level and was not particularly useful particularly in the second half of the course add more detail furthermore the presentation style of the professor is not engaging nor does he address interesting archetypes or examples in his lectures the early material was fine but again presentation could be dramatically improved lastly the assignments were rather interesting early on but once again quality decreased as the course progressed	1
this course rely on commercial library i am sorry i dont believe the convenience of a commercial library is good for your learning you may end up locked in	0
poor video and audio quality not worth the price	1
简直是毫无帮助作业根本提交不了无法通过的its a waste of time	0
extremely poor quality of instruction the lectures themselves are little more than the material being read directly off the slides by an individual with a poor grasp on the english language the majority of the slides are walls of unclear and nondescriptive text even with reading directly from the slides the lecturer is overly circumstantial in her explanations if not just outright tangential i commend the authors for putting together a course outside of their native language but in this case at least it does more harm than goodin short this course has the air of a group of first year students giving a presentation verbatim from the slides as another commenter also mentioned below	0
the lectures for this course do not adequately prepare students for the graded quizzes and assignments	1
i had technical problems with both courserss online system and also with the rd party online coding tool	0
good idea  intend horrible execution	1
too easy	0
great course on introduction of machine learning	4
some content is good and informative but theres a big problem with the teacher accent adding a ch at the end of half the words and his diction hesitating on the other half the words also it seems that the course was created in a rush and lacks a lot of polishing sometimes the course assumes a good level in computer science and then  minutes later it explains how to do a decimal to binary conversion this makes many videos boring but the slides are not provided so you really have to view the videos entirely ive followed much harder courses with pleasure but here it was torture to finish it also most of the course is just definitions of some specific terms and not practical explanations i agree that defining a few words is important but here its just too much  some videos are in reverse order some are stopped in the middle of a sentence some quizzes are bugged and dont give credit properly and theres nobody to help students	0
there was some interesting information in here and i found a few things useful that said you have to sift through a lot of gimmicks to get to the parts of the lessons that actually matter	1
good course well paced a bit too focused on academic institutions	2
a good introduction to games without chance	3
so easybut the teacher is well	2
i think this course has many introduction about the logics of internet but its not so interesting as in the previous courses in the same specialisation	3
this was a very good course however the assignments were too long to complete in only a week	3
this course makes a valiant effort to provide as much coverage of bayesian statistical methods as the prior three courses in the statistics in r specialization do for frequentist statistical methods but the lack of supporting material eg readingtext exercises directly paired with each lesson really hampers this the videos are quite informative but if you dont catch on to the material based strictly on the videos the weekly quizzes can be a bit frustrating	1
nice overview of galaxy but does not really provide enough information for a beginner to start using it without additional resources	1
helpful assignments that got my more familiar with the language a more exciting class than the intro class for people who already know other cs languages	4
a bit light in terms of content this probably could have been condensed down into  lessons	1
good course but it is missing detailed explanations for some topics	3
this is a great introductory course for the health of transgendered youths many intersections such as socioeconomic factors race geography or access issues are not addressed which heavily impact this community and possible families that are disenfranchised by these disparities	2
nice course but be aware that this is at a very basic level	2
the course is poor exams are too easy video lessons are boring and not engaging content is poor too did not like the course	0
i have passed now the  first courses of the fundamentals of computing specialisation and i have to say that i am very grateful to the instructors for the amount of new knowledge i got from working on this coursesat first i my aim on taking this courses was just to learn python but now i can see how much deeper the scope of this course is i have learned so much more than just the syntax and grammar of a programming language i have just started grasping the way information can be organised and searchedi have to say the  parts course principles of computing is not easy the difficulty escalates exponentially as we move forward you will need time to pass the projects and tests take it with calmly and seriously its worth ita big thank you to the instructors for their efforts on making the learning way entertaining even just by trying to be funny you guys made it enjoyablehighly recommended	4
a good start	3
very nice and enlightening course i totally recommend it	3
i had great expectations but the course focuses on really basic stuff if you have worked with spreadsheets before it wont help much if you havent it will not teach you how to use it	0
too far from subject	1
this module was very interesting it just have to be updated as things change so fast	2
there was nothing in the course that i didnt already know but im no longer young  i didnt expect there to be i wasnt wild about sitting through lectures about being active while pregnant or making sure my kids exercise for me thats a waste of time i know what i need to be doing  i was hoping the course would inspire me to do it unfortunately it did not i got tired of hearing about walking or bicycling to work as the main way to get active i am now retired but even when i worked that was never an option	1
bayesian stats is a broad topic learners would benefit from more material	3
lots of great information knowing the history behind seo was a major plus for me	4
good introduction but it feels like it is not complete it is not much without the other courses so you either take the entire specialization or the benefits are not that big i feel like the specialization courses are an artificial break to a real university class if the university class had only the content from those videos that would not be enough	2
could have been more useful	1
the course has been released way too early clearly it lacks most of its content and what does exist isnt working properly either	0
the course could be completed in a matter of a few hours super basic stuff waste of money	0
easy to understand	3
this course was uninspiring	0
i slogged through it and got an  but the videos were boring and the quizzes were poorly worded and should have had greater correlation with the course content	0
i loved this course	4
un bon rappel des bases merci encorewwwbrandelyscom	4
immediately applicable to the workplace the learn at your own pace style is great for those with more rigid work schedules and the lectures are a fantastic resource i wholeheartedly recommend this course	4
i feel like the lectures were short summaries  not actual college level lectures i really dont feel i learned anything	0
excellent course instructor materials were great	4
major issues with the tests not accepting chinese or pinyin text which they failed to respond to despite multiple complaints	0
really helped me to plan  schedule and lead for my project	3
very elementary takes approximately  hours to completecannot continue with the indept material but have to wait until next week and payment ofcourse	1
too easy and full of straw meaning thing not needed	1
after about week  helpfulness decreased quite a lot	1
this course is great and fun tooi learn many thing that ive overlooked for these years just like nutrition label and soon this course tell me the basic knowledge of healthy meal and the importance of making my own meal unfortunately this course is pretty much short like the otheritll be super if the content of the course could be extended a lil bit or a lot more is better though p	3
too difficult	0
in my experience this course has a huge gap the lectures go through all manner of tools commands packages etc about cleaning thats fine and probably necessary its like this is a hammer this is a saw thats fine and probably necessary but then you get to the final projectall of the sudden youre plopped onto a construction site with your hammer and saw and a pile of wood and told to build a house youve never built a house before and dont have the slightest idea where to beginwhats missing is some principles of tidy data construction in the lectures when introduced to a new data set what are some approaches to understanding that data how do you develop a plan to build a tidy data set ie how do you think about developing a plan not looking for a step by step instruction setits disappointing that the only way for someone new to data science r etc to tackle the problem is to read someones third party monologue about how to make your reviewers happy	1
very helpful	4
i had a knowledge about graphics using opengl and i found this course a great introduction for using unity and game development in general	4
not adapted to an online format low quality videosinteresting topics but no efficient progression many sections become an update about ucsd research not adapted to the audience	0
way too general	1
this class assumes a lot of statistical knowledge and background that is not covered in the first three classes of the series so much statistical terminology and jargon was used by the instructor it felt like taking a class in another language where i had to constantly stop the video and google for the terminology she used it took a lot of grit to finish the class which was overall a very demoralizing and negative experience	0
i think you should make update process of graphlab more intuitive this was the only problem i have faced during this wonderful course	3
if you want to know the array of options of the various tools in the tuxedo suite and dont want to read a manual then this course is for you i was hoping that there would be some conceptual grounding in what each tool was useful for but that was not present at all	1
this is one of my top three favorite courses ive taken on coursera so far	4
taught me many planning algorithms in an easy way	3
i struggled so hard no way near the same level as the other coursescame from computer science background and felt that i missed so many terms and concepts that were required for this course	0
patronising and very poor in content	0
dear coursera team thanks for providing the course it gives best over view about research methodology it tells us how to askdesign a research questions how to plan literature review and what are different types of research methods	4
far too easy and far too basic for me i would have hoped for a more indepth and scientific look at food and nutrition	1
not that bad ive might have learned more visiting other mooc like openclassrooms where they give us more information about coding this course is just showing the basic not as complete as other online course platform where they show you how to insert video contact form and audio	2
nice course with good information and helpful practice	4
excellent resource for getting up to speed with some of the challenges that the accountancy profession is faced with i do however feel that this course and the accountancy profession as a whole needs to the consider the repercussions of rapid technological advancement and how these would impact the profession as a whole the accountants of tomorrow will need to be able to delegate the mundance daily tasks associated with financial accounting and bookkeeping etc and be able to think and act more like business people the course should also look into this aspect	3
too many speakers not very wellcoordinated or organized very wordy and diffuse where is the gist of what they are saying in so many words	0
learned spark apis internals	3
thank you so much	4
i audited the free version of the course i found it helpful in brushing up and polishing parts of french which can sometimes be difficult to find and study online theres a great portion of french media that is incoporated in the course which is great film clips comic strips pieces of writingif this course lacks two things it would be more assignments especially practice quizzes and above that more detail for some of the topics for instance i found the covering of pronouns to be lacking particular in detailing the difference between dont a qui à lequel etc and then asking questions about it a good course i think worth the time	3
no complaints this course revealed im more interested in the interpersonal dynamic of influence and persuasion vs the logic of arguments	3
please avoid to take this course lessons seems to be at least not prepared by the teachers	0
great and very informa	0
content of the course and presentation was great but the audio quality was not so good as they are echos on the background and need to set to high volume to heard the speaker	1
quite allright for an introductory course to image processing but to really understand the course one needs to have experience in basic dsp and statistics otherwise many of material wont be as clear	3
the lectures were informative this course is a must if one wants to understand the reasoning behind the creation of certain institutions and instruments the quizzes were dull and basic stuff they were just kept to test the attentiveness of the student during the lecture	2
would like to have seen more material using git and git bash commands more repetition here would be helpful seems like a lot of this information will be lost or forgotten when it comes time to use it especially as it relates to the data science specialization	1
a great course	3
liked this course very much	4
good introduction	3
this course is very easy to understand because of this its oversimplified	3
feedback in assignment is not good enoughfor example for the points and segment there are no correct answer in output as a reference	1
i have switched session but for the second time nobody reviewed my assignment for the second time i have a doubt about such approach and this particular course as one before a capstone project to my opinion it should be held after a capstone	1
couldnt finish it because assigmnets were not graded	1
there are tons of ml classes on internet even for free but this one is the amost comprehensive topics coverage and b easiest to understandi am not saying your will become an expert of ml obviously but you would get a full picture of what ml is doing and how will they improve your daily life and work you still need a lot of mathprogramming experience to build your own ml system or application software having said that by taking this class you know where you should start the nd comment is of course a compliment and requires years of hard work and practical experience to explain such a esoteric topic to everyday people like you and me through simple word and a wellstructured agendaif you have zero knowledge in mlprogrammingcalculuslinear algebrastatistic like me please take it and am sure you will get more than you expected	4
i feel content of the presentation need to improve second the voice quality also need some improvement it was not clear it was looking as if some one behind the screen is just reading the slide content please elaborate each points mentioned in the slide in some slides the end content was skippedbetter would be if some person is always present on the screen it grabs the attention of the listener	2
easy to understand but i just cannot recall too much half a year after finished itmaybe it is a little bit superficial	2
a useful overview of designthinking concepts with a focus on application	4
week three quiz is real bad i suggest you give it a try and see for yourself	0
last week was incredibly difficult	0
feels like everything is solved using a caret package while the backend theory is only slightly touched by using a single line command solver student may lack the foundation for harder problems in the real world	2
great course very helpful	3
great work	4
bunch of information but the videos are tedious	1
please include supplementary materials on controller tuning	2
highly effective course for me and my data science skills	4
no factual tools 	0
the final negotiation homework was very interesting and useful in internalizing the concepts i didnt like the fact that the course spent a lot of time covering legal topics perhaps due to the instructors legal background i wish there were practical recommendations on salary negotiation	2
helloi already finished the cours the cours show me ways and procedures to make plannings and schedule controls things that i was looking for since long time i strongly recommend the cours for planners initiators and budget schedulersbest regardshenry capellan	4
there is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignmentsquizzes	0
good courser for the beginners right place to start and begin where the course endsthanks a lot especially thanks colleen	2
good basic course	2
its so low that i can do nothing now after learning with every work in this course done	2
need to be more advanced even for a beginner	2
compared to other courses i have completed on coursera this is one of the most confusing ones so far	2
liked this course entertaining and challenging although im not sure how useful meteor is in the real world	2
awesome teaching technique i feel like she is right in front of me and not virtuallyand she actually is	4
not worth the money	0
good course learned from others	3
its so hard for beginners in my opinion	1
not all examples are right	3
this course was disappointing compared to the first course in the series introduction to data science if you enjoy reading academic papers and peer reviews then this course is for you if you dont then just search the web for tutorials on matplotlib and seaborn	2
i have mixed feelings about this course i notice that a lot of courses like these in us colleges are incredibly glorified the professor sounds knowledgeable i have to admit the material however seems mostly like common sense most of it is life skills that you simply pick up over time just like business courses people love to label everything concept or process with some kind of nice sounding term to make it look professional or whatever also very boring	1
very easy  very good for beginner	4
this course is a useful if superficial introduction the concepts presented are pretty basic but foundational the quizzes are very easythe instructor covers the topic in a pleasant and clear way i would however have liked examples of a more visual nature show dont tellironically the course materials show disappointingly little concern for user experience or design the slides look like they were thrown together in a rush and without much care for design or even spellchecking the quiz multiple choice answers are laid out in an awful confusing antiux way someone should spend a few minutes fixing all of this	2
great course	4
very brief  some points are leaved without explanation	1
most of this course felt inconsequential unhelpful and not worth the money id condense some of the commonsense aspects into other sections of the course and eliminate the  minutes of filler videos	1
not too interesting but certain things were useful	1
i liked this course and teacher i learned enough interesting and useful information unfortunately this course is paid	3
tiny lectures and no readings from professional books	1
the professor is wellknowledged and able to provide very high quality course i do lean a lot from his classthough english is my second language prof georges explanation is very clear easy to understand and on the point the videos help a lot when i was learning its more efficient and memorable than reading the book i also purchase the book and write notes during my learninggenerally is satisfied by the knowledge i learned so far due to device limitation i prof and other students may not able have interaction which may influence our learning quality negotiation required a lot of practice and experiences but i still can see our profs effort on making this class memorable to usat the end thank you prof george for providing meaningful education	3
the lecturers are very enthusiastic but i was hoping for examples and assignments based on pandas and skikitlearn instead the course examples and assignments are based on a machine learning package called graphlab that stopped working when it was upgraded to version  there are workarounds that enable it to work locally but clearly it isnt enterprise ready	0
why is this its own class seems like it could have been covered in a week somewhere else	2
the course is interesting much to be learned and topics are open to much discussion some of the presentation need to be simplified and shortened repetitions tend to lose emphasis of the main ideas additional literature is welcome but to those of us whom love science and specially brain mysteries this course is a different perspective from those physiological or pathophysiological brain courses theoretical ideas of the brain are not easy topics but it does make an interesting discussion thanks for the effort and the course is appreciated	2
overall an excellent course well organized and taught matlaboctave homeworks can be tedious but thats coding for you	3
the educator is really wants to be boring the questions doesnt reflect the material why am i learning so much about a dog or who is whose relative in a bioelectricity course	0
outstanding teaching by professor ng	4
files used were for an older version of meteorjs which made installing the application and doing the assignment really confusing  help was not forthcoming and i eventually unsubscribed from the course	0
an interesting class but left me wanting more i realize that this is an overview but the field of secular buddhism seems very shallow after going through this class and reading three of steven batchelors books i have the distint feeling that i may have reached the end of the subject	2
the breadth of the content was good but the depth particularly with the recurrent networks from later weeks was a bit lackingthere were a few quiz problems i spent a while on only to check the discussion section and realize that the informationimage provided was inaccuratethe coding assignments could be slightly more frequentoverall this was a good course it seems like it would be difficult to give a thorough treatment of this topic by simply watching these lectures and taking the quizzesprogramming assignments i think this course is best used for introductions to various topicsauthors which can then be used as a stepping stone for more intricate individual study on those topics	3
very good materials and practices thanks	4
we are expected to complete a quiz for which we can submit responses only when we purchase the course what bullshit	0
outdated course that needs a lot of changes to your code and in releases so you can follow professors codea lot of people had same issues	0
i liked that the quizzes were not easy it made me feel the class was worth it it is a good intro to study design and basic statistics definitely a gateway course	3
the course content was somewhat scattered and lacked focus i think the whole topic of the talent pipeline was completely lacking structure and cohesiveness cheris presentations were not as engaging as the others and her slides were poorly prepared  often difficult to read and not necessarily related to the topic at hand	1
the course is very hard due to the difficulty of the explanation the course has a lot of points to cover with few explanation	1
great course should be in every school	4
i had a hard time paying attention to the woman speaking and dropped the course after completing week one	1
this is a well explained course that gives many incites examples and provides the reading material to you at no cost ed hess is an awesome professor i took both the grow to greatness courses in	4
enjoyed the last weeks taking this course and assignments i would recommend any person to take this course	3
the reason why i am giving only one star that the course did not covered much information and the time allotted could have been less than  weeks so it was not really worth the money	0
far too academic nothing of substance but lists im not here for monotonous lectures	0
course is a little formulaic had trouble making my submissions follow the structure outlined but still i learnt some useful tips and actually got to just write something orderlyliked some of the visiting speakers the third speaker who talked about character  mature lady dark hair was quite good so was the first gentlemanoverall the course is ok but given the strict methodology and requirements for writing i dont know if ill make it through the specialisationthank you for reading	0
the presentation is extraordinary practice test helped in excellent intuition however more methods needs to be developed	3
ive started the course and i have found learn to program part but where is quality code	0
this course can only be taken who have good knowledge in programmingalthough there is a assessment quiz at the start of the course it needs to kept in mind that since this course is part of specializationmost people would take it and not all of them are programmersthis course needs a revamp to suit all sorts of security enthusiasts	1
if you are new in the learning of business model generation is a choice to start with but if you already have some experiencie this course is very very basic	2
very complete and up to the point lots of useful resources	3
it is very suitable for those who have no background involving machine learning this lecture is very basic but practical and essential	3
it seems like the team have tried to do the whole course in one take perhaps some practice would have been in order at least to work out what they are going to say next content is ok so far but delivery is tough to listen to	1
this course doesnt teach much beyond how to use galaxy tools	0
this was a very interesting and entertaining course i enjoyed it a lot and can only recommend it thanks	3
very rushed presentation blows right through a lot of fundamental concepts without a deep enough explanation or enough practice material especially in the last two weeks i feel like completing this class will require supplementation with better instruction	1
not as good as the others and way too quick	1
great course to get you started into ruby on rails	3
hi how do i finish the course i stayed in module two and i would like to finish the course thank you	3
i thought there will be deeper info	2
although parham aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization its a bit of a baitandswitch prof aarabi is an awardwinning professor at u of toronto but it turns out he knows little about ios and has jack wu teach most of the material jack wu is probably a heck of a developer but hes a terrible instructor this class is the best of the three in the specialization because mike spears does a pretty good job with the sections he teaches	2
the course materials are good and give you an idea about html css and js the downside is the presenter attitude towards the students presenting like she is talking to th graders	3
this was amazing every week there was something interesting and fun to learn and i couldnt stop wondering about that thanks to professor marc van oostendorp martin inga and other informants and contributors who made this course so highly informative and wellstructured you gave me a good foundation to continue learning please make more courses	4
this is a basic course but since this is what it is design to be it is ok	3
english is horrible and i am french	0
too fast	2
well worth the time topics are clearly explained most of the time i was getting a bit lost in the math towards the very end last couple of weeks but even though details were hazy i think the general concept was conveyed well the labs could be a bit more insightful for a few of the weeks but were overall good	3
good course	3
this course is not even considered as an introduction its a complementary for those whose career is robotics  in other words the required prerequisites are more than matlab programming skills and some calculus and algebra its assignments have many problems that cannot be solved using just the course studyingthe course doesnt give many information	0
very easy if you have a programming background however perfect for beginners the course is well paced and introduces advanced concepts at a good pace	4
i dont know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using spark and distributed and parallel computing and that is really annoying previous  courses were great maybe this one will improve	0
great course which covers different areas of machine learning with practical examples and real life use cases	4
its very good	4
the topics are of interest however the course content could be presented better in most instances it is hard to predict where the instructor is writing and is hard to read also writes over the slide material	1
if you want to memorize what year countries started their public broadcast systems this is the course for youit only briefly discusses critical paradigm shifts and shows the course lacks a critical analysis element and the video lectures are unstructured it would be almost impossible to pick three key points they want you to learn from each video	0
this course is best for recent graduates it covers the basics feedback from course participants is not very valuable unfortunately people just dont have the time or the experience to give any substantial feedback for a projectcentered course i would expect feedback on the project your resume to be importanta better course that covers the same topic in more detail is writing winning resumes and cover letters ive taken  moocs on resume writing and this course is by far the best much better use of your time	1
simple fast and useful	4
great really useful	3
im really glad i took this course most especially when it comes to bower et al really really glad for the opportunity thank you	3
too basic this should just be a read	1
i was really disappointed with this course especially considering how great the first course was imothere was too large of a jump between the two courses and the plethora of im totally lost threads in the forums would seem to back up my opinion im currently reading head first android development and it is exactly what i needed to grasp basic concepts as well get my bearings in the android world if this class remains the same i wouldnt be surprised to see attendance drop in further courses andor coursera starts receiving complaints about the difficulty	0
i need practical information but this video was full of tables	0
what a great class thank you very much for all your work on this it was a great learning experience	4
not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuffwe do all the work the instructor does little or nonetoo much peer raqting stuff which i despise and there seems to be no way to unenroll	0
i found plenty of useful information in this course overall but lectures often spent too much time dwelling on the detail of simpler concepts while more complex areas and sometimes critical information that was later built upon were only touched briefly or sometimes skipped entirely i missed a sense of continuity as we skipped from model to model with a minimum of time spent on how the models complement each other and their relative strengths and weaknesses in applicationthe way data structures were defined in the code was particularly difficult to deal with the coding exercises all suffered as a result it ended up taking way too much time to figure how to decode the data and trace logic around it this meant that grasping concepts and learning from the questions came in a distant second priority to debuggingdr koller mentioned that the material is aimed at postgraduates i felt that the level of content covered here would just as easily be grasped by most undergraduates in technical disciplines if it had been delivered in a more structured manner with clearer progression across models conceptually and mathematically and better code examples when delivering in this format allowances need to be made for the facts that tutorial sessions do not exist and the possibilities for informal qa are limited so any gaps become very difficult for students to fill in themselvesdespite the above shortcomings im glad i did the course and i would still recommend it to someone interested in graphical models as it does cover the basics well enough to make a decent start im not sure whether or not id recommend the programming exercises as they are a significant time sink but at the same time without spending time attacking the programming problems the concepts are not likely to gel based on the video and quizzes alone	2
prefer more challenging course on this topic	2
the swirl exercises were helpful but the video lectures and assignments were not therefore i cannot recommed this course there are better resources for learning r in general and r programming	1
greate course thanks to all who create it	4
amazing the course with the instructors charismatic and powerful delivery lives up to its name it truly presents management perspectives critically and with great impactthe delivery style is unique because the lectures are filmed at real lectures with the instructor speaking to students and students contributing their voices it feels like youre part of the real lecture when listening to the instructors teachingbeside exceptional delivery style the course structure is very engaging with business lessons that draw from history all over the world the assignments are thoughtprovoking and make students think critically about management through practical scenarios that were discussed during the lecturesthis is really great one of the best courses from ie business school	4
information strays between ridiculously shallow and unnecessarily deep eg the stuff about gpcrs is so far removed from importance when discussing addiction most of the time the questions are poorly worded and thoughtless and the whole thing reminds me of a bad high school class some parts border on misinformation does seem almost as if its been underwritten by the dea paints a very distinct picture a picture with an agenda and really incomplete portrayal of addiction points for trying though	1
excellent material and methods i found the course extremely useful and practical	3
i was disappointed because the name is misleading the course provides a good introduction  overview of the responsibilities of the cto but has very little specifically digital content it deals with twospeed it in a single short lecture so of course the treatment is superficial it is easy to find more indepth material freely available on the mckinsey website for example	2
too easy	2
the course was often confusing and the quizzes came down to a question of trial and error i found this very frustrating although the topics were interesting i didnt find them very well presented in spite of the enthusiasm of the lecturer but there was a lot of ambiguity and bias and the inability to discuss except through the forums was offputtingit wouild be good to know why answers were wrong in the quizzes particulalry when you had put a lot of effort into studying themin the final exam there are questions which are evidently wrong both in their wording and in their marking and nothing has been done to remedy this in spite of the complaints in the discussion page	1
very short overview well explained but wish there was more depth	2
i learnt a lot thank you	3
good in general theory part on complexity is too tedious	3
i thank coursera for this wonderful opportunitythis is a good course for learning basic concepts in python	3
its really not good this course told us a very basic things never give us deep detail and in most of course it shows us the code and you should write like this but there is no deep understand what is it	0
very basic course for those who dont have any basic knowledge	2
interesting useful really well explained	4
although parham aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization its a bit of a baitandswitch prof aarabi is an awardwinning professor at u of toronto but it turns out he knows little about ios and has jack wu teach most of the material jack wu is probably a heck of a developer but hes a terrible instructor	1
lot of considerably complex and dry accounting and statistics subject matter covered at a high level without much discussion quiz questions are unnecessarily complex  which imho will discourage  turn off those who are new to this subject matter in completing this course the last week is pretty interesting thoughi am taking the full business analytic course  and find that the quality and complexity of content is all over the place some are way too simple and some are highly complex	1
a little light but still effective course	2
executive summary do not spend time on this course if you have minimal common sense and have read at least one article on data sciencei finished the  week course machine learning  stanford university  by andrew ng  months ago which was such a great course it kept me busy for about  days at about  hours per day and i learned so muchthis course a crash course in data science  johns hopkins university  part of a course series the executive data science specialization provided just some superficial obvious information took me only  hours to complete and even this time i would could wasted timefinally coursera now starts to make courses smaller and smaller and them adding multiple of them up to specialization so that at the end you have to pay much more to get a certain amount of information and course time with this course they seem to have streched it to a new extreme the price for the certificate for this superficial short mini course has reached the same price   as what i payed for the extensive great machine learning course from stanford university by andrew ng 	0
although the instructor was good at presenting the information i felt that the reference sheets should of had the phonetic pronunciations next to the korean writing this would of helped learn the symbols better after the second week we were expected to know what they represented i felt it needed a video on just learning the alphabet i did still learn a great deal of vocabulary	2
when i started this course my only experience with html was b boldb i italici and uunderlineu after this course i have a much clearer understanding of what html is and how it works and i am able to now use it to a much greater extent than i was beforethe professor did an excellent job of explaining most things but i did find that on occasion i had to stop the video and go back several times to understand what shed said or to take notes despite having slowed the video down as much as possible in my opinion one should be able to slow the video down more than is currently possible especially for those for whom english is not their native tongue with me it wasnt that i didnt understand what she said so much as i didnt have time to take in what she meant before shed gone on to something elsei understand that coursera is able to do what it does because of its method which is basically independent study one watches the videos and reads whatever resources are listed and goes on from there if there is a question it is not the professor in the videos that the question is asked of but people hired as teaching aides these are the people other than fellow students who answer your questions and they do not always answer in a timely fashion while this method works well for some people i am quite sure there are others unable to learn with this method especially if the subject turns out to be a more complicated intensive one some people need to have a little more than just videos which they can only repeat over and over with the same information hoping to learn something new from itthe only other thing i have a problem with is the lack of oversightsecurity theres no way of knowing if the person who earns a certificate is the person they claim to be or if they earned the scores givenall in all i think coursera is a great tool and well worth the low prices charged i am sure there are plenty of courses still remaining after the purge that i would love to take	3
its mixed from previous courses on scala not coherent many unrelated topics with little explanation of their importance and realworld use cases	1
informative with lots of additional resources	3
wow the presentations are really boring the java script part is super confusing	0
the instructor moves very slowly both speaking and covering topics points get belabored i usually watched the lectures at x speed but i also have some basic tableau experience	1
overall this is a good course it provides many handy tools frameworks techniques for datadriven decision making process it does improve my decision making skill however the course is quite short and doesnt have much indepth content	2
great course this has definitely helped me understand how to meet an investors goal along with how companies decide on investments relative to a clients needs	4
course address some elementary issues about iot but the instructor at times seems like he does not have a good grasp of the lecture materials no access to quizzes or evaluations as auditing participant which is a shame since most of the coursera moocs allow access to evaluation material under the auditing modality	1
this is a fantastic finish to a brilliant specialization i gained real usable skills and a lot of confidence doing the capstone	4
clear presentation interesting examples encouraging knowledge helpful professor	4
this course is amazingly interesting all the course content are relevant and easy to catch up everyone should join this course to create basic knowledge of finance	3
although the content is good the course itself does not reflect in any way what a good asynchronous course should be where is the discussion board how can one communicate with the instructor or with other classmates although peer review of an assignment is one aspect of asynchronous and synchronous education said assignment should also be reviewed by an instructor especially when said instruction carries so much weight in addition i think overall the tests are unfair i was marked wrong twice for a question that asked my opinion also in the check all that apply questions if one misses one of the answers the whole question is marked wrong finally many of the test questions themselves are irrelevant to the content of the course one last thing the course says its a five week program but there are only  weeks something needs to be adjusted	0
focused a little too much on telephone history though some was interesting perhaps spread out to other modules as short background materialwould have preferred historyoverview from internet age with focus on various protocolstechnologies that were introduced ip tcp udp mqtt thread bluetooth zigbeemodule  made up for its more dynamic and more germane presentation may be make it the st module with other modules going back for a brief historical overview	2
the exercises ae far more advanced than the lectures and study materials	2
its very good till now i am thankful to god that i came across this	4
interesting subject matter but difficult to understand as a native english speaker very awkwardly worded and errorridden tests	0
needs a little more of a breakdown on decision trees caculationsgreat course though	3
thank you	2
this module makes me think about the tax i have been studying about the taxes and how working  thank you to the leiden university i have been learning about of the famous beps and other themes sorry for my bad english	4
the videos were ok reading materials added some value although about three years have passed since the launch of the original course and the materials are all the same i expected that something new would be introduced to give it a bit more value but what is very questionable is the architecture of the quizzes on one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers some of them  to say the least are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong what by itself is not very reasonable and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered i am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple i am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructors opinion is regarding the question at hand in some cases the best answer chosen is absurd highly questionable this approach again i believe that evaluations should be challeging but these quizzes are a bit esoteric they lack objectivitynonetheless it is important to say thank you for being present in this platform and having the will to put it together i wish you luck for the future	1
i know it is a lot asked but would be great if the delivery was a bit more enthusiastic also a couple of suggestions to make the learning easier please do not use loud keyboard when making videos and please be mindful that some people use single screen to view video and code on the side so if the details on video are very small it becomes quite hard to see what is being writtenthanks janis	3
its cool	4
rough around the edges the assignments are not clear enough i never got contacted by my mentor and didnt know how to reach out to him eithercontent is good	2
there are a number of cryptic instructions that really dont need to be hidden simpler instructions would make the course more effective for those who arent developers in their dayjob	2
all of the courses lecture are great until it reaches week  where its really hard to catch the programming assignment doesnt give enough hints and lecture in this topic doesnt help much	2
great course easy to understand and build on concepts but the week  and  assignments were very similar might want to do something different there	3
i think the course covers pretty good range of topics and gives you a good information i really liked the peer review assignments and i think they put pressure on you to achieve the goals and learn from themi definitely did not like the multiple answer questions or the last assessment the questions are not well presented and there is a clear violation of the help and error recovery heuristic for me i also did not like the video setup the quality of the course material is really poor and disappointing i would like to believe that on a ui course people would have come up with a better and more intuitive setup finally i would like to have a document in the course resources that students can download and keep that contains all the information we taught like quick reference guide again we can download the videos but when you are looking to fins something specific searching in  videos is not fun at all	1
interesting course which goes one level dee	3
too much speciific details that make the course difficult to understanding	1
several courses have been combined content is not updated now is 	1
shame you have to pay for this course although the content is good	0
my best coursera course so far  and probably one of the best courses i took ever the information was really new to me eg the greatest enemy to learning is procrastination  in german aufschieberitis or start hard jumpy easy it was presented in a funny and easy to grasp way i loved the zombies and the little private photos and videos from dr oakley it was extremly helpful eg anki and the pomodoro methodas a mother of two teenage boys i am happy to pass on what i learned to my kidsthis is a valuable and fun course and after the course they keep you informed with regular emails on the topicthank you thank you thank you	4
i missed something more about the last lessons some achievements like in the previous	3
useful course if you dont know programming if you do its a bit simplistic love that all of the slides are available for download	4
i feel that this portion of this course did move a little too quickly in terms of introducing new sql concepts the first couple python program demos has my head completely spinning and i think this could be largely avoided by having a couple more slides piecing together the logic of the programs other than that another great course	2
too complicated	1
nice course but lot of troubles are arising during the completion of this course still i am unable to complete it and could not find out the reason once i got a message that my course is completed and i can get my certificate but now it says still assignment pending i dont know how to deal with it	2
tutors reading from a teleprompter comes across as robotic lifeless and boring we should be told before we do a piece of work that we can only submit it by upgrading not afterwards	0
i expected more content the course description says that there is material for  hours however the videos are only one hour long	1
more technical aspects could have been touched upon details on how to implement code on any java platform using inbuilt java libraries and several others	2
it was too basic informationmaterial for what i was expecting	1
excellent course great lecturers very knowledgeable of the field both lecturers gave an excellent explanation on their respective stand point on the crisis and how the effects were viewed one from actually trying to mitigates the effects while the other observed i will recommend this course to anyone in the banking field and search for similar courses to gain a better understanding	4
good course but too much data for the modules to fully grasp without a background	2
it was very good to learn terrorism from the theory angle and believe the two groups should work closer	2
foreign accent is totally ok but very poor presentation skills by lecturer material should be refreshed some already outdated	1
more excercises should be added to the course	2
i like the content at a high level and i have a better appreciation for the value of graph analytics that being said i struggled with the graphx hands on exersizes where many of the scala commands simply hung	2
a lot of the lecture material is unclear and does not fit with the content ive learned from other bi books lectures and experience additionally the quizzes dont seem to test for realworld bi knowledge rather they test for the ability to interpret the instructors fairly unique views on some bi topics furthermore the additional readings need to be culled significantly it looks like someone just googled bi topics and then copy and pasted the links they found please prioritize the additional readings highest value to lowest value and then post only the  to  reading that rank the highest a pairwise comparison process may be useful when doing this	1
very little interaction in the final project seems this module does not follow the principles of the earlier  with regards to virtual teaching	1
the course is very good	4
i didnt like that course because ofweak explanations of algorithmsalmost all assignments i googled i spent all my time googling these algorithmswhen code is submitted and something goes wrong it is not possible to understand what is really happened	0
provided unity scripts for projects dont work properly with newer versions of unity quality of video recording is kind of crappy esp audio most of the stuff learned in this course youd be able to learn straight from the unity tutorials anyway not recommended unless you absolutely need scheduled assignments in order to learn	1
brief highlevel ideas could use more specific examples	1
hello from russiaits very good course for learning chinese language i like it	4
the course could have been marked by  stars if it werent for the promotion of a commercial python library developed by one of the speakers there is no way a student could complete the course without having python installed and a free licence acquired from datocomstudents should be able to use any programming languages and scientific libraries to do their homework and the subsequent courses of the machine learning specialisation are excellent examples of such approach	2
this is really an useful course understanding the concepts of learning in turns helps in learning something new the concepts explained in this course are simple pictorial easy to understand and easy to relate im feeling good about taking this course sincere thanks to drbarbara oakley  terrence sejnowsk taking this initiative this course will have good impact on the lives of many	4
this is an instructive course but not represented in a very engaging way i wish that the representers find a more interesting and engaging way to teach grammar i will be doing the whole specialization but there moments that i get so bored and unmotivated i have to force myself to keep going and i love english and find grammar interesting in general	2
a great course about europe we will learn a lot about europe its instiutions history foundationsand above all you will learn how you can act for europe at the end of the course you will have everything in hand to know how and where to begin to actyou will need to study very seriously for this course but it worth it	4
it is very basic and the principles are for a thirdgrader after all the things said at the end the first video was about pancakes nvm they were gluten free	0
class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials also the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week	2
this course is a discreditation to coursera and its low standards are appalling from a purely certificate based perspective the only requirement to complete the course are completely the quizzes they are short and can easily be googled or the slides can be downloaded and the answers simply crtlf for keyboards there is zero need to watch the lectures  at least for the first  weeksthe lectures are terrible themselves the english is beyond horrible and i dont understand the modern culture of having teachers teach in languages they cant speak it is purely reading off the slides in any case word for word i learned more about the basics in neuroscience in a  minutes lecture from a separate course computational neuroscience than the entire first week hereif you actually want to learn neuroscience check out hardvardxs intro course	0
very helpful in my everyday life 	3
really basic info that most foodies will already know i liked the cooking demos but i am vegan glutenfree and eat mostly organic already	2
the course was really great and understandable in my point of view it would have been a bit more challenging but still a great course especially thank to colleen and her great approach	2
a good intro class thank you for sharing	4
very informative	4
the enthusiasm of the instructors was the best thing about this class but i really wanted a more rigorous methodology  and didnt really get it here but it was an alright introduction to machine learning but not enough if you want to know what makes the black box work	2
lecture presentation is very very robotic its hard to follow the lecture without proper diagrams or examples	0
need more material course is too simple	2
totally not what i expected most of it was concerned with mathematical problems	0
while the material is undoubtedly useful te structure of the assessments is not very helpful for example in week  we are asked to create data frames from input files these are presented in descending order of complexity for cleanup furthermore the points for most of the questions are  despite what are very different demands fore each part in the final week the dictionary of state names is counterproductive in answering part one some state names are region names and one can either get  or one fails the course as one question is worth  of the gradesome of the autograder feedback is so terse as to be downright infuriating add to that frequent issues with the notebook crashing and much of this coursework was an exercise in unnecessary frustration rather than increasing enlightenment	1
very well organized lead and makes you apply all the skills youve acquired on all of the courses in real life example enjoyed while working on the capstone	3
interesting but didnt explain in depth many of the topics	2
very informative and very useful course full of knowledge packed thank you so much to all the teachers	3
so good buti hope korean subtitles more perfectly	4
the course and the knowledge provided is ok but the peer correcting is really bad it takes tool long some people are cheating and if youre unlucky you may not be corrected at all and fail the course	1
well i expected more and more debt it seems the course is oriented to the general public	2
good video lectures pointless assignments 	1
there are better courses on the subject on coursera and other platforms it worth it pursuing it if you are interested in joining the capstone project	1
an essential help for those who are determined to gain enough insight on project management	3
i would only like this course better if it was longer and more indepth excellent	3
i found this course interesting and engaging i originally worried about whether i would be able to understand the instructors accent but there was no problem understanding the instructors english the material is a good introduction and i learned quite a bit	4
simply the best course out there 	4
i expected little more in terms of how to structure food habits and diets	2
puerile made up examples with made up data no deeper treatment of the mathematics involved than the hereisamagicformulauseit approach and mistakes including serious conceptual and factual errors evident in the quizzes and the r labs far better to look out for the data analysis and statistical inference course by duke on coursera that is presented by a passionate statistics teacher covers the same material and more and provides a far better introduction to r than this courseone of the stated purposes of this specialization is to clean up the way social scientists conduct science and are perceived as scientists in this respect it appears that the worst enemies of social scientists are social scientists	0
this was a very thorough course that i really enjoyed and learned a lot from	4
it is very interesting but realy an overview it seems that the main information is on the next moocs of the specialization if you are looking for a standalone introduction to marketing i would recommend searching for another course	3
there was no home works	1
no open source libraries this course is not educational it is a sales pitch to use their expensive software good luck having an employer pay this amount of money for software when they can hire employees that can use free open source libraries	0
the course was very helpful the lecturer taught very nicely and made the session interesting	4
quick and easy but i would have liked more examples for instance how npv and irr actually works on excel luckily i have some prior knowledge of the subject but sometimes it was not so clear for a complete beginner	2
the course is very bad and feels thrown together at the last minute learning a and dijkstras algorithm is great however the assignments require you to learn not just the little details but to discovery techniques not even mentioned in the course material in addition you must have strong matlab programming skills and be familiar with much matlab functionality in order to debug some of the assignments you must have more knowledge concerning matlab than any of the course material or pointers provides meaning that beginners will not pass this course the automatic grader provides no feedback at all except pass or fail this is unfortunate as it can look like your code is working correctly but the grader is using some edge cases to grade the code but will not include any information indicating what to look for this is really atrocious although the tas do occasionally provide answers to questions the total amount of time tas spend answering questions is just really poor dont expect even well asked questions to be answered at all in addition the coded template quality upon which your own code depends is horrible and thrown together you will spend way too much time analyzing it for clues as to what went wrong sadly enough all of these issues have caught up with me and i was unable to pass assignment  part  even though everything looks like it works and achieves the desired goal and even works with all of my own test cases the grader is merciless perhaps in the feature more time can be devoted to make this course better and i can spend more time learning how the algorithms and maths work rather than matlab and the automatic grader at this time i dont feel like my money was well spent on these courses i dont think i would like to risk another  dollars learning matlab and debugging the automatic grader on any of the other courses in this specialization that is very disappointing as i really am passionate about learning robotics and looked forward to the other courses as well	0
some of the reference materials might need updating but perhaps there are no better studies to share at this point but overall found this an interesting application of the traditional ps of marketing to the digital world	3
disappointed by this class instructor and mentors added not value to course the main reading emarketing was good but all video content and assignments were directly from the emarketing guide by rob stokes also  they couldnt even get rob stokes name spelled correctly in the references	1
one of the best course i have ever taken i wish i would have taken this in high school	3
videos were not ellaborative examples sparse and were not edited to completion after months of this course repeatedly being delayed we see a complete failure with information design both in course and in practicei was very dissapointed with this course and the timewasting assignments i have enjoyed the courses leading up to this one but this course was obviously rushed and poorly planned	0
i really do not like the r language i think it is sloppy and inconsistent this class did ok teaching the basics of r but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of r code a key part of writing code best practices for modularization and factoring and so on in other words it teaches you how to write r code that kind of works but does not teach you how to write good code in r	2
class was boring and the professor wasnt inspired nor inspiring	0
course doesnt seem to be of much use was not much informative only some information is relevant	2
great course a lot of fun	4
the strongest part of this course is that it prompts the learners to apply the designing skills	3
very poor lecture i barely learn anything about excel from this course the course title is quite misleading	0
the material taught in this course is great it focuses on how to launch your idea using the lean start up business model etc if you have been reading some books you will find some of the things mentioned to be familiar you will also learn how to build your team and navigate through difficult conversation such as equity division you will learn on what to look for in hiring key management and professional servicesunfortunately some of the points mentioned may not be relevant to countries outside usa	3
i wanted to love this course so bad but unfortunately i couldnt there was a great distance from what was taught in the lectures and what was asked for you to do in the assignments and its not a matter of knowing how to program i know ruby and python but r is a very peculiar language itself perhaps they should invest more on gradual exercises like the one they advised to do on github or some easy statistical exercises now i dont know if i should take the next module or if i should look for something out of here where i can learn r i see potential on this course	2
great course with fabulous teacher i still want to learn more	3
bad content and instructor no logistic in place if you are planning to pay to get certificate i would suggest look else where my  are stuck in here and they dont reply to forum posts	0
waste of money	0
there is insufficient peers to review the content is mostly theory from the etextbook	0
very awesome class for statistics very clear explanation recommend for any one who want to know statistics	4
lectures are very confusing instructors should use white boarding to explain codes difficult to follow them	2
there are many details dont explain clearly enough for a beginner to understand	2
the test is terrible and teacher is just reading the ppt boring	1
a very precise and interesting overview into the world of design and graphics	3
bad teaching quality	1
this is a very introductory course meant for people having absolutely no background in d graphics or d game development as a student with some experience in opengl and concepts like d transformation algorithms and whatnot i believe that the course clearly delves into the making of the games rather than having deep insight into the algorithms required for that which is absolutely amazing and easy to understand for a starter however if the course takers are expecting a deep insight into the d world and the mathematics behind that youll have to rely on other sources like books on computer graphics however as an introductory course this clears the required concepts to a required extent	3
this course is not challenging at all	1
case study was superb	3
it is easy and interesting	3
great course the material is presented in a logical order and in an easytounderstand way in the videos proofs for most of the concepts and methods are discussed so why is no longer a mystery the textbook also is a good supplement to the videos i would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about sequences and series	3
sorry but although i found the topic of interest i found the delivery very dull yes prof covach knows his stuff but basically what we got here was little more than a reading of text from his book i know he explained why the actual music was not included but think he could have done more to provide links and stimulate listening i eventually just started reading the transcribed text of the lectures as i did not find looking at prof covachs talking head at all stimulating prof covach did nothing to stimulate discussion in the forums and although i posted a few things there was very little going on in the forums i bought the book on the basis of being interested in the topic but it is not at all necessary for the course	1
if you have higher education and studied derivatives and matrices this course is a quick review and test of your skills if you never studied course subjects you would hardly be able to learn them through this course i completed it as a part of specialization thats the only reason	0
great kickoff for what i am sure will lead the students to countless hours of solving puzzles with python i wished the assignments would have been a bit more challenging but they definitively fit the purpose	3
never received a certificate or a grade no one responds to email i will never purchase anything through coursera	0
simple and logical for anyone to follow	3
a great intro course to machine learning concepts the only problem with me is the environment its course dependent and dont feel like it can be widely applied in various fieldsi would love if tensorflow or sikitlearn was adopted through the coursegreat course though 	3
frankly so far this is the best in career success but still not well presented	1
this course is immensely helpful for any one who wants to get into the area of digital marketing the lecture series along with the recommended course material gives a very good insight into the vast world of digital marketing i am happy i find this course and could complete successfully as well	3
this nicely packaged course is learner centered it engages the learner by enforcing practice through interesting exercises and quizzes kudos and thumbs up to the team of great instructors	4
very confused so there is little point only vague news  nothing substantial	0
i loved participating in this course i really learned a lot  thank you	4
audio is terrible  cant continue	0
too much marketing bs practically zero valuable information  minute videos targeted at tinder audience probably	0
very interesting thank you	3
i enrolled in this course just because it is offered by nobel laureate prof robert shiller coming in i had absolutely no expectations completing this course changed my perspective of how markets operate prof shiller covers a wide array of topics and i was dazzled by the fact that every aspect of the market is closely intertwined	4
i found the course interesting however i had trouble finding all of the written materials to read some were available online but none were in our library system i think it would be better if more of the reading was available to people i also thought that the final assignment instructions were a bit confusing as it is i never did get to upload the photographs for the final prompt i asked for help on the forum but no one responded	2
ive only finished the st week yet i can say that lhl is very effective my learning abilities have greatly improved it helps a lot to understand how our brain works for a more effective learningit is so good that i am going to buy the book a mind for numbers thanks barbara oakley dr sejnowski and everyone else for making this course free and available to everybody 	4
in my view this course may be too simple but it makes sense for any beginner	3
i find the course material at coursera all very good what is lacking is the peer review system i understand that there is no way they could offer these courses at these prices it is however the only reservation i have	3
very generic advice although the interviews with childrens writers were illuminating and helpful the marking system was inaccurate for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasnt good solid advice about setting character scene and place and ideas to help you out of writers block the two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience some of the activities were repetitious but i guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist	1
it is an excellent course with and excellent explanation 	4
the content is really greathowever you can buy the book for  and get almost all of the same information  in sum the class is essentially chapters from the book the movie and a bunch of links to websites with relevant content	1
not enough notes	0
the scope of the course is interesting the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine but the contents and quizzes are very often offpoint a specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents affirmations are most times not justified at all incremental prototyping will yield a featurerich and robust software the quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before the contents about scrum are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here i know it takes a lot of time to prepare this material but clearly that last effort for quality was not done	1
great coursegood jobif you could remove the small errors this would become close to perfect work	3
a very great leture about game theory really appreciated	3
too basic wish they had more content	1
great accounting ratio analysis	4
i hate to write a negative review when the designers of the course have clearly put a lot of love and attention to detail into making it butthe quality of the code is bad the quality of the testing code is even worse this endeavours to teach some horrible practices thats a shame because the editing quality of the videos is excellent the use of git and rspec is likewise commendableeven worse its not entirely clear who the target audience is a lot of the topics introduced are aimed at complete novices yet not explained in a way novices might understand the course needs some serious rethinking and refactoring	1
very short quality of the course is ok	2
week  is an unreasonably difficult jump from week  this courses beginner friendly lectures do not align with the level of understanding needed to complete the assignments	0
need clearer examples and explanations slides summing up concepts or used functions will be great	1
this course give the basics for machine learning principal algorithms it is very clear	3
 is not enough to express my desier to study data science	4
good introduction	3
this is a very unevenly paced and constructed course  not at all delivered to the standard of the previous coursera courses i have followed some lectures are clear and guide the learner step by step  and then others suddenly assume a level of knowledge and sophistication that is at a significantly higher level and includes concepts that have either not been introduced or have been dealt with in minimal detail it also ends up focusing more on music analysis than music theory  while there is a relationship between these  approaches i did not embark on this course to become an analyst  as a practising musician i wanted to understand more of the concepts behind what i do and hear very disappointed  i will now look elsewhere to satisfy my learning	1
this was my least favorite of the course the questions were out of order the videos and lectures were terrible and dry	1
i enjoyed this course matthew yeeking is an excellent lecturer and is very well versed in the topic	4
really helpful the way theyve explained stuff with such ease makes it totally worth it	3
honestly not a very well designed course i went through the videos and tests for weeks  and  and found that its just rushing us through the basics while not really telling us much much of it was heres an introduction to a tiny detail you go find out the rest	0
really not good i am trying to find out how to un enroll	0
despite all the bad reviews this course got i told myself to give it a try to refresh my antic prior knowledge and since it is for my personal usage and not a career i m not interested in a certificate so i went through all the open sites which were extremely disappointing since i was warned by the reviews i was not even tempted to pay to unlock further pages i attended many interesting courses on coursera but this one is simply a waste of time from the very first moment	0
i felt like the testcandidate for a new course while the coursework and the presentations itsself were excellent the homework was a real pain as very often the autograder didnt work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct to be accepted as the right solution cannot recommend it to be honest unless they improve their systems also it was said that the other course specialization start soon but it seems they dont and i paid for the full package	1
great foundation to power electronic learners	4
very interesting lots of useful structure	3
the instructor videos were clear and informative the course had a balanced mix of game development theory and practical exercises solid introduction to the unity game design platform the projects increased in difficulty and time commitment as the course progressed building on prior knowledge the peer review of game files was challenging at times but it was a good experience to create actual games	3
could have been much bettergood for newbies	3
a good course but the learning curve in the middle shoots up so the hill is quite steep to climb some typos here and there in documentation but overall a great course that really challenges you to think hard	3
from the first  seconds of the first video i can know ill love it	4
the theory is excellent but the exercises are too difficult for beginners	1
i did not a lot about marketing in general and even less about digital marketing having started a business with a friend with an archaeological background i felt like in the middle of a dark forest this course is really well organized the concepts are well explained and you have really the chance to understand the subject with case studies and assignments i strongly suggest it	4
pretty decent course for learning r basics	3
errors and glitches in the first two quizes that arent fixed dont worry be happy its just a formating error ignore the literal text displayed and just use your imagination to interpret what we thought we meant to say have left me too unimpressed to spend more time wondering if i need to debug my code or debug their quizesthere are many other resources for learning python out there and some of them take pedagogy seriously not it seems this one	0
dr chuck is just awesomehe gives valuable information in such a very fun way i love this classlearn about scraping the web apis rest architecture all that while strengthening python programming skillsthanks dr chuck	4
having done some other machine learning moocs  this course seemed rather basic to me and did not enjoy too much using non opensource software for the programming assignments the material is nice in this sense i would have expected to default to scikit learn and offer using graphlab create as optional	1
learning online was better then expected sometimes there was some hard tasks without all the hints but searching for answers is a good way of learning there forum isnt very helpful though	3
i am really disappointed to be honest course covers mostly trivial stuff lectures are just presenting code snippets many inaccuracies nothing about html entire weekclass can easily be completed in one weekdefinitely not near the quality i am used to from coursera udacitys intro to html and css and javascript basics are way better	1
it was great although i expected a bit more of coding touch	3
actually i think this course is a little too easy and not so informative	2
where do i start	0
two stars because i have found poor explanations of assignments i finished the course without being very clear what i was asked and i lacked more feedback when one of the tasks is wrong the teacher and the videos are very good	1
good subject and good selection of documentsi dont appreciate the speaker voice on the presentation i rather like to see and hear the author too fast and too short	2
few tools on xls has been shownmore extensive and complex problem are required on use of monte carlo method	2
did not like the course complicated concepts and poor representation  i still really really appreciate the efforts of those who put it together with their hard work	0
the teacher needs to improve her delivery the quizzes are also useless they dont really add to important information that we need to remember instead the quizzes usually have questions that make you gofer for irrelevant info made to test if youve gone through the reading honestly i barely listened to the teachers videos it wasnt all that helpful nor engaging we got all the info from the readings	1
didnt like the course though did only one week in the first week you are supposed to write a research proposal though there is a lot of talk on what research is no actual advice is given on how to write a sound research statement whats more with no knowledge on how to do it you are supposed to assess the works of your peers i doubt that inexperienced in research beginners will provide valuable feedback  at least i would never do it if i hadnt been quite experienced in that the second week is devoted to the discussion of the importance of literature review isnt that obvious	0
this course changed how i learn and solve problems	4
i enjoyed the course looking forward to the next  modules	4
you cant have a music of the beatles course without playing some of the music surely under the fair use provisions of the copyright act parts of the beatles music could be played as well as parts of youtube	2
this course needs a update im really disappointed of week  and the assignments are outdated and nothing new	2
interesting bit not worthy of the invested money	1
capstone project methodology is a bit disappointingthe previous modules were great	2
essencial for learners this course give me not only a big picture of how our brains work based on neuroscientific study but also beneficial techniques to learn brandnew thing without giving up strongly recommend for everyone who wants to learning something new and accomplish your goal	4
good course to understand the basics of data structures and performance of different data structure implementations	3
have certain degree of difficulty	3
i really enjoyed this course it boosted my insight into managing projects and solving conflicts	3
not the best course for beginners too much theory and no implementation also the assignments were impossible for a beginner	0
unclear ambiguous direction and material that is unhelpful for building the final project	0
great course it is so awesome that a concept such as happiness can be studied academically and yield good results  	4
great course  i would strongly recommend	4
good info but kind of dry	1
enjoyed the course	3
the course material did not cover anything that we needed to complete the final exam although i learned a lot working on the final exam i felt overly stressed  i had to self teach myself in order to get through it	1
the information is useful but i think the five courses in the specialization could be merged into a single one	2
it may be the purpose of the course or the specialization but ive been finding it too easy i wish it could be more challenging and that it could offer me more opportunities do practice	2
excellent course the only thing i would change is the meat dishes suggestions	3
very hard and confusing for the beginner	2
very basic content i am not sure that there was anything new for me in this course i am born in france and i guess we learn this from our families	1
prosconcisemodular based learningconscourse needs more auto graded assignmentslack of feedback in discussion forumsassignment language is not very clearoverall i prefer this course to the android specialization but not for the reasons you may think the android development platform is more or a less a mess compared to ios android studio feels more like a toy than a complete product emulation is slow and almost unusuable with plenty of boilerplate code required to do simple events xcode by comparison is very smooth and easy to use swift syntax is also very clean compared to java syntax but is not without its grievancesat the end of the day you will choose the platform you work best in	1
some materials are useful but the teacher has no idea of teaching techniques and good presentation very bad choice for the university of irvin california to entrust such an interesting course to such an incompetent and feeble instructor she is reading in a monotonous way and nothing more her presentations have no meaning she does not appear in the video lectures she can not introduce animated elements the materials she selected are sometimes and only somehow relevant the most of the materials have only percentages and small details on history a course of poor quality	0
this is a great a course	4
i think there are only few contents	0
originally i rated this course stars however i have since decided it is worth star after taking the next course in the series bootstrap i thought that there wasnt enough time to cover all the material to make this course good after taking the next course i see that it is possible to deliver a lot of material and concepts in short order however it takes thinking planning and dedication i think this course is terrible and seriously needs an overhaul after taking this course you barely know any css and despite passing assignments that dont challenge youre probably worse off than a student who fails in schoolthe course suffers from the extremely short timeframe covering one of each of the three core topics a week is just insufficient to provide any sort of depth to this course while there are supplementary readings coursera and the participating institutions need to understand that there are those who are taking courses to get more than a one page wiki style coverage of a topic	0
lectures should be more detailed	2
great course if you like coding and would like to know more of the fundamentals of python then take this course	4
content was great and prof shiller is one of the most important economists of his generation however the assessments could have been better structured so as to be more challenging and a better diagnostic tool for learners see the wharton school introduction to corporate accounting course for an example of well implemented multiple choice exams	2
an excellent introduction to an extremely powerful digital audio workstation  one which i had used for a few months but still learned a great deal from the coursehighly recommended 	4
it is an amazing course and a good gate for machine learning	4
powerpoint slides were never offered in this course even though they were supposed to be no follow up from teacher or teacher assistant	1
i did not feel that i learned as much in this course as in the previous courses of the series the assignments in particular seemed trivial and were compromised even further due to some technical problems with the simulator recommended for students without access to actual hardwarethis course would be a good candidate for revision with a focus on gradually increasing the depth and complexity from stage to stage and on commonlyused components such as current amplifiers and shift registers problems with the simulator should not be cause for compromising the assignments themselves there are other ways to address those problems many of which were employed by students as they competed their assignments	1
good resources and material for self study the guest separe was very interesting	3
compared to other python courses i have taken this is course has no meat on them bones and is not worth  at all even for a certificate however for free ok worth the introduction to some useful tools spend your time and money on a more valuable course like fundamentals of computing specialization which is awesome and is about the same price as of this writingthis course offers no challenge little content and the assignments let me down assignments are basically handed to you where you only need to alter one line of text to get the right answer on what is supposed to take an hourintroduction to interactive programming in python thru rice u has content and weekly mini projects that really push your learning ability and after taking the courses i felt like i really got something out of itthis course barely scratches the surface of accessing web data and does nothing to challenge your coding skills the positive side it introduces you to web apis the basics of beautiful soup and other buzzwords at least structure assignments to combine all of the efforts learned in previous chapters onto one anotherside note what is the professor doing filming lectures on vacation or at lunch this does nothing to add to the content of the course and is distracting and unprofeshthe meaningless assignments let me down	1
well presented and clear however the course is more a history of smartphone operating systems than emerging trends of the technology	2
well structured course which is presented excellently highly interesting and thought provoking the topics covered were relevant to the context especially the diverse case studies all credits to the teaching faculty	4
too many grading errors	0
the videos ramble too much which makes it hard to really dig into the material	1
this is the only course in this specialization that doesnt seem to belong with the rest of the material it seems out of place and too little was done to relate it to learning pythonmoreover learning databases and sql is easy rather than taking up a whole course this content could be relegated to one week of lectures in conjunction with some external references for further reading four weeks were spent on this external topic while the more interesting discussion on using python with databases is glossed over haphazardly in the last weeki am a big fan of this specialization and think prof severance does a great job explaining some of the basics of python in a short amount of time but this course needs to be restructured	1
nice introductory course to learning which fills an important gap in education i would have personally liked a little more rigour to the assignments and material but the current level is i suppose targeted to participants of all kinds which is fair	3
very good introduction lightweight explanationsbetter animations and videos could enhanced the learning processquestions are too easyneeds more complex tasks to integrates the different sections together	2
topic is interesting however the lecturers not quite lively	0
assessments are way harder than the taught content be aware to spend way more time on them than the estimates	2
very good course for developing yourskills with web many new interesting and usefull information good constructed tasks recomend	4
the teaching is good the course is a little heavy and a lot to take in in the later weeks but as a further grounding for statistics and r i would very much recommend it	3
as a professional actor i knew the ability to write my own material would be an invaluable skill ive been writing tvfilm ideas for years without a the slightest clue as to go about creating a full story in script form having no formal training this class was the perfect introduction into the craft professor david wheeler simplified the intimidating feat of writing a tv pilot into a realistically executable series of steps i will definitely be revisiting this course in the future	4
the content was interesting but the quizzes didnt relate to the lectures very often it was as if there was a major piece missing in this course one of the questions even referenced a book that was never mentioned or made available also several of the musical sections seemed to be in the wrong place i think maybe this is one of the classes that doesnt work well in this format	1
course goes through basics of upstream midstream and downstream oil and gas industries also its markets	3
this a very readable and useful coursethank you very much for this information	4
i found the video lectures less helpful with this course than the quantitative course and resorted to reading the transcripts in order to learn the important information i did enjoy the assignments  observation and interview processes and found the application helped better understand the theory	2
incorrect references subtitles that do not follow the video questions in the questionnaires that have not been studied and which one does not even know where to find references the worst course of this certificate	0
content is very condensed  but finehowever you need to pay to do the quizzes and even the peer assessment  something where you are contributing by reviewing other participants work charging me for supporting other participants and supporting a learning community mindset seems ridiculous to me	0
incredibly vague and hand wavy i didnt feel like i had to write anything down	0
good course with adquate information	3
 introduction videos each week and tons of links for readingdo not wantthe worst course i ever tooknot enough video material with good explanations all we got  links to articles which we can found ourselves without any help	0
love the practical recommendations given by the professor and the course basing itself on research and case studies instead of  textbook however the professors nonverbal communication palms down can be a tad unpleasant	3
practical tips are few and neuroscience is not the title of the course but is widely discussed the title implies tools for learning but i didnt get anything useful out of this course	0
for most people this might be four stars there is solid content here but i couldnt help but feel a lot of this stuff is fairly standard odmanagement material and in some ways it felt like asking say a project manager to deliver a data science course if you have never done any managerial training or read material on intrinsic motivation org and team culture then you will get value for me this was pretty stock	2
too easy for cs major	1
i get this course since i really want to learn on boosting however i think the course pace is too fast and should be include more nongreece symbol i have a background in biostatistic and epidemiology but im still having a hard time understanding lecture i would say that this course is the most difficult among this specialization practical machine learning is much easier than this i bet many students will have a problem in this course since its a beginner level specializationmy suggestion is to slow down  expand the lecture with more drawingpicture explanation more r coding and get rid of those greecesymbol as much as possible	1
probably a very interesting course but the way of teaching looks very indigestible no video and no real explanation or examples	0
very good for people new to programing	3
i really liked the course has been developed and delivered by prof andrew ng the course is cleverly designed to accommodate people at different skill levels while the videos assignments and lecture notes are very valuable and free to access it would be more encouraging for people to join the machine learning working community if the certificate fee is lesser than what it is now thanks to coursera prof andrew ng and all the volunteers	4
solid introduction  slightly disjointed and fairly boring presentation	2
one of the best courses	4
very little content on offer other than some short clips and mildly interesting readings the vast majority of the course is dedicated to short writing tasks that are supposed to get you engaged ie discussing diplomacy but the practical effect is at best busy work with little new knowledge or insights gained extremely disappointed	0
good course	4
sorry the professor has a genial  cheerful personality but the program material is just too basic and it takes forever to wade through it all i will enrol in more advanced courses my mistake not yours thanks for the opportunity	1
it is very interesting but we have to face problems with teradata i have not been able even to log in and a lot of students are in the same situation and the problem persists even in the duedate of the test	0
perfect for beginnernovice programmer who wants to take the next step	3
i really enjoyed the coursework for this class in particular i loved how challenging some of the assignments were however i do hate that i cannot submit final quiz answers without paying for the course i also did not like how little help there seemed to be offered to some individuals on the forum regarding issues they were facing with their code specifically with the genefinder projecti took three of the courses from michigan on working with python and they were completely open to complete without payment which means you opt not to get a verified certificate i wish that this course and the specialization that it is part of fell into the same category	3
bad content and instructor no logistic in place if you are planning to pay to get certificate i would suggest look else where my  are stuck in here and they dont reply to forum posts	0
different fun approach basic science	2
horribly designed and developed jack wu may be an expert but he does not know how to teach others	0
had important problems with sas which were due to a bug in the software but did not receive any help from moderators however the course was good and interesting	2
the presented material wasnt coherent for me i didnt walk away with knowledge of functional design principles for largercomplex software the topics presented seems just a bunch of topics next to each other	1
i suggest to do this course only if youre doing whole specializationcourse is simply bad teacher doesnt give to much information and project is very hard to finish	0
to be honest i thought the course stumbled and fell short it was too basic and slow paced the tone was a bit immature at times and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroomnot something for working professionals and its certainly not mature enough or challenging enough for a university class even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience it could accomplish that while providing more content and making the content relevantis the course worth the price hell no if you do pay you may feel very cheated at the end the entire course can be reduced to  pages of notes one would be better off checking into other free online tutorialsim not sure about the value of the videos titled office hours they all appeared as selfpromotional behavior from the professor as if to say hey look how great i am making this video in paris theyre really nothing more than that in one video he corners a guest speaker at a conference who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brushoff other people here would like to talk with me too after all of these videos you will ask yourself okay why did severance make me watch that what was the point and youll shrug your shoulders and say another waste of time	0
while i really liked the first course i have massive problems with this course the first  assignments a high concept document and a story bible were doablebut a full gdd and a prototype on week  and  these arent parttime tasks for a few days these are fulltime tasks for at least a full month each to do them properly from scratch these assignments are so unrealistically hard that they demotivate and im saying that as someone who already had quite some ideas for one game and even started experimental programming for people that are taking this specialization without a focus on game design andor without ideas this course is going to be hell to finish in time	1
there is very little insight in this course the instructors slides are very poorlydone relying on graphs that arent appropriate for the data being presented and without labeling the axises there is no engagement in the course forums the quizzes are trivial to pass	0
too basic should give an example on how these math skills are used in data science	1
wonderful course for a starter however there were although very few points where a more structured approach could have helped making things easier to understandbut a very helpful course to understand the landscape of the business metrics and their application to reallife business problems	3
this course is a good review of what i have learnt before and it clears out some confusions quite useful	3
awesome course definitely worth taking	4
the course is really trivial maybe i was expecting so much but the material is really to simple also there are a lot of material which lector things is fun and cool but it is really anoying please try to focus more on programming instead of being cool and fun thanks for understanding	1
the course could be week long instead of  the material offered is introductory level quizes are too easy programming assignments still have bugs and grading procedures cause a lot of confusion	1
usefulbut not very deepsucceeding in giving a general understanding of python	3
huge gap between videos and final assignmentvideos should be edited we are not interested in trials and errors of the instructors	0
some prior knowledge is assumed but the course does cover everything although the basics are glanced over very quicklyhtml and javascript coverage was excellent but i felt that a little more time could have been spent on more complex css	3
platform tooling for emylators and native devices is tricky and if done wrong it impacts a students ability to finish the coursehowever these topics get very little attention	1
hopelessly fast compared to the excellent basic statistics by the same team i gave up in week 	0
i recommend this course	4
first and foremost thank you for providing us with all that material which is of high quality the only improvement i can think of is a better sound quality and also having a person of your institution to review peers assignment or something of similar logic in order to improve the evaluation process of the assignments thank you for your time and may you continue your wonderful work	3
overall some weeks were fun some notin some weeks are too many chapters and exercises i actually think that the exercises are too complicated compared to the examples in the chapters sometimes are the explanations in the chapters not sufficientit would be helpful to know the name of a proof eg perchs law or law of the excluded middle this would help to find more information and help	1
its a good introduction but more optional hadoop exercises can be added	2
didnt provide much info beyond the basics of git could have skipped this one	1
this is a joke right minutes long videos with questions after it shall teach me effectiveyou guys are ridiculous	0
this course does not belong to this specialization poor content poor assessment quiz and felt quite disappointed it is way below par i never thought i would have to rate it this bad if not for specialization that i am aiming for i would never take it period	0
i think the teacher had to little expression  it was like he was reading loud and i felt i might have red the text myself i lacked some enthusiasm	0
average course some cool case studies but overall not amazing and not many business models	2
this course is structured around a specific and costly python library called dato it is possible to do the homework without it but it is extremely difficult to do so if the course wasnt structured around using dato it would be a lot simpler and a easier to complete the assignments also a lot of the mathematical notation was written in a kind of psuedo python code that made things confusing sometimes	0
this course was tough but i dont mind a challenge but what i found frustrating about this course was that first the quizzes were often inconsistent with the lecture material the tas were less helpful than my fellow classmates without whom i would not have made it through the course and the final was an immense challenge that took over my life for about  week  despite the calculation by the instructors that it would take  hours i did give it a few stars because i honestly did learn things i did not know and i understand the value of the application of what was taught for modern businesses i have been informed that the course is being reviewed by the instructors for strengthening and i  agree with that direction	1
this instructor is godawful im sorry to say by the rd week i stopped caring about this class and my grade for that week definitely expresses my disinterest im having to force myself to finish it has she ever taught a class before i felt like this was her first time uninspired  not looking forward to her next class	0
this was a very necessary but boring class	2
 points out of  for professor peter  point out of  for professor mike the first  weeks were good as professor peter presented with very brief and sum up the ideas on another hand the last  weeks were bad professor mike didnt do well in term of summary he spent  for introduction of each topic before reaching to the points that he want to make most of the time he didnt make any points plus he didnt answer the questions that he asked i am disappointed i was expecting to learn more as the course structure was impressive but the actual lectures are not covered the topic	1
somehow interesting course about data analysis the lectures are interesting for those who have no prior knowledge about the topics but boring to those who have it the assignments are quite challenging and the disadvantage is that they are not connected to the lectures and are therefore not well explained what i like about the assignments is that it is practical	2
assignments are very inaccurate mess with table and field names oracle vm is very heavy and slow to use on regular laptop	1
inaccuracies and low level of engagement	0
very interesting and useful course	4
this course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching the topics are broken down into manageable chunks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest however when i wanted to go back and reread for clarification i found the transcript to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible as an example inacol national association for online and blended learning is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribed in the text in a number of different ways ian nicole inacles and inickel i really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures many sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words enrollment was spelled enrolment often i just wanted to read it the lecture not hear the instructors voice but found the written text to be less than clear i also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material but unfortunately there was not not that i could find finally some of the questions on the final quiz are confusing for example question   which two of the following and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply i hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction	2
ive only gotten started but there seems some assumptions made about how much we know and how quickly we can pick up these new terms and ideas	1
excellent starter course for core data and networking	3
the informations were useful but the videos were repetitive this whole course had the amount of informations as one week of many others if it was free i would have no complaints but since it is part of a specialization i expect more removing all the fat each week would have  minutes worth of materialalso i did not appreciate the length at which the speakers promoted their books	1
this was a bit challenging not in content but more in organization i felt like i was getting freshmanlevel lectures and than was given a graduatelevel assignment the directions and expectations could have been clearer but the ta was terrific in trying to help us thru our difficulties	3
really good study and practical materials i really liked itit wouldve been better if the autograder works correctly 	3
the lectures were not very interesting or instructive the reading materials were much more so however the assignments in the class were based much more on the lectures and on selfreflection than on the materials i learned a little bit and as such found the course worth the time i put into it but i almost think one could get through this course with little difficulty without reading any of the written materials and thus derive very little benefit from it i would encourage the makers of this course to do a significant revampingin addition to greater incorporation and emphasis on the written materials i think more reallife examples of diplomatic successes and failures would be a far more effective and entertaining use of the lecture time than the esoteric philosophising that seems to characterize it in this edition	1
what struck me the most was the fact that some of the concepts that are taught in this course are things a lot of people are already doing on a subconscious level it really helped me look at things like this from a different perspectivewhile you could argue that some of the examples and metaphors that are used by dr oakley are a tad childish for older students they get the point across very wellthe book pretty much covers the course material and in that sense i dont consider it a necessary purchase having said that it helps to read through it to help you solidify the things that are taught in this coursethank you to everyone that helped for these life long lessons and sparking my interest in neuroscience	3
i liked the course very much for a foreign speaker though i found it particularly challenging the nuances of words are particularly important when dealing with matters of style and i struggled through the exercises which i found a bit more abstract than those in preceding courses of this series maybe it was just selfconsciousness in any case because i encountered this struggle the course was helpful in making me think about how do i want to pursue my next steps in the process of creative writing  should i continue in english or should i try instead to do it in my native language i am sure this is a question that many other students have asked themselves i shouldnt conclude without saying that i do recommend the course in any case	3
great entrylevel python course	3
i didnt enjoy this course as much as the others particularly due to the fact that i am only looking for hands on knowledge on how to develop a game and not create a business around it	2
while the content common predictive regression and classification algorithms and tools like xlminer was useful little to no support was provided in the forums the assignments in week  and week  in particular were either vague or had errors that nobody double checked and coursetakers had to use trial and error approach to get answers right	1
this code is great to learn the fundamentals of python the videos are interactive and the quizzes and assignments will help you practice it in detail	3
does not give much intuition around the subject i found the lectures a bit uninspiring lots of powerpoint just text no images or visuals really and the lecturer just underlined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out i found the udacity intro to machine learning course gave a much better intuition and understanding of this subject we also had slides on how to split data into a training and testing set on pretty much every lecture  what a waste of time	1
constants errors in explanations made you work very hard to complete it we typically work hard the organization of this course my you to suffer you will go to learn a lot like i do final grade  learn in this course can be frustrating they will push to the water you will need to dedicate a lot of time discuss course material with fellow learners mentors and instructors to learn how to swim to save your life	1
the early lectures were profoundly dense monotone and cluttered with noncontextual detail while being strangely given the subject seemingly empty of a real desire to share or convey understanding i am confess that as much as i was looking forward to guest lecturers i couldnt make it past the first three	1
good course but could be more challenging for people growing up with the space race it has a lot of interesting video and written materialbut there are a lot of simple errors in the material and the assignments hopefully that will be addressed id give it  once its all sortedrecommended if you can cope with the odd frustration	2
this course was clearly not ready the autograder for the final project was a complete fail it was not a fun experience trying to change around my code to figure out what the autograder wanted	1
i liked the course  there were plenty of useful tips throughout however i felt some of the assignments were unnecessarily oblique and complicated particularly the second assignment ultimately it was a helpful course though i feel much of the information expectation and specific instruction could be more streamlined	3
the lectures are too brief and do not go into details pertinent to the main theses of the course while it is evident that each of the roosevelts had a significant impact on their respective time in history saying that it was a rooseveltian century is going a bit too far nearly all the reforms that they initiated were countered by the end of the th century wagnerpyser glasssteagall were gutted by the end of the century and as for the un we all know how in ineffective that has been at protecting human rights the only thing that has lasted has been social security and that is under attack by a coopted ultraconservative congres	1
the course is comprehensive and covers technical social economic legal aspects of bitcoin the technical treatment is hands on and gives a really good fell for how bitcoin and blockchain works compared to several other sources where treatment is superficialthere are several parts of the course i was not able to get a clear understanding  such as implementation of the actual bitcoin core in the stack based script also i found the questions for the programming assignments convoluted and not very helpful in describing what is required from the student had it not been for discussions on the student forum i would not have been able to complete the final assignmentdespite the shortcomings i would recommend this for someone who is good in java and would like to get a technical as well as comprehensive understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain	2
great  even for a non native english person  is easy to understand the dr charles severance had some struggles during the homeworks cause i didnt understand exactly how they want me to do it  did it first in some way  got same answer but not same process  so that was the hard part for non native english person besides that it was great	4
the instructor says in the first video you do not need to read a book on how to write a script  in my opinion you do better to read a book or two than waste your time on this course the videos are extremely short shallow and a waste of time	0
course has been insightful for me andrew has put the ideas in a way that made me nicely absorb the applied value of machine learning thanks to everyone who is part of this course it was a delightfully enriching experience	4
nice course and good study materials	3
do not like the slides and the way it is explained compared with other ml courses on cousera this one makes me feel that it is more like a handbookdictionary instead of a tutorial to teach students if you already know it it would help you refresh the mind otherwise you might find it is just to show off how how complex and mysterious is the data science	1
first two weeks are too much theory  but i guess that is needed for clear understanding of an awesome week 	3
really wish there was an option for onetoone mapping of the stanford course in its full rigor	1
not enough tableau use for it to be in the title of the course	2
this course is too broad and specific to usa	2
really great	4
good course but the way it is required to be done sucks	1
good for someone who has no idea of anything about calculus	0
needs to structured a bit betteranswers to discussions if provided will be very helpful and help analyse situations in the way instructor aims tothe mit case readings not min things thos cases are all like  pages	2
good content with a nice bit of character and playfulness from the professor be prepared to find your own ways to practice and solidify the skill though	3
whilst i can see why the idea of reproducible research is important there wast really enough material in this course for the full four weeks  and in fact a lot of the videos repeated the same information	0
very lovely and knowledge impacting course	3
the assignments had a lot of ambiguity the course content was wonderful it would have been nice if d computation problems were involved week  was really interesting 	2
html and css were great javascript was very confusing as it did not teach me what each part of the code meant including the syntax  and hence i was unable to understand anything by week  despite having listened to all the lectures and participated in the all the activities i wish javascripts structure was more consistent with that of html and css	1
excellent course difficult but woth the effort	4
lectures are very boring and designed in a weird way he is simply reading the book that he wrote and no real practice was ever done	0
might be a good introduction for those completely new to computational tools but not useful for those with any background in git or r can be safely skipped	2
good course but i dont like how you have to finish each module within a week it would be better if you could finish everything in fourweeks	1
if the course had the same information and effort as week over all  weeks i would gave  stars although the assignments are pretty good and i learnt something new however the assignments are fun but the grader is annoying as the single error output is something is wrong try again	0
i didnt learn anything usefuli just didnt like this course at all	1
it is a very simple and smooth course for new comers i think it would be better to have more challenging tasks and more related to a real world thats why ive put  stars practise is everything so good tasks are the essential part of learning process	2
even if you are fluent a review is always helpful to remind you why things are done a certain way if you are not rusty it should take you no time to finish but if you are rusty in some area and just dont realize it this will point to where the problem may be and fix it	4
very basic	2
excersices real excersices to really understand the theory	2
id give it a  but its not possible so im leaning more towards a  than a the most positive thing about the course was prof van lent who really knows her stuff she also has a calm soothing manner of explaining things and moves with it at the right pacethe content was easy to follow and quizzes were useful final assignment was messed up and they really should fix that but the additional eight questions were basically a transcript of the code itself and if you did your own code you shouldnt have had any problem distinguishing the bad code from the good one extra stuff for those who successfully finished the course was a nice touchthe real downside of it all was the staff i got my question answered nine days after i posted it when i had already finished ive also seen some rude and condescending yet sparse answers to other students similar but worse things happen in css course as well i dont know who those people are and how they got their jobs but they should be replaced or sent to professional conduct and time management class	3
good overview for those without management experience for experienced folks  probably a good number since this is an executive data science course  it was pretty basic also some of the elements come down to management style for some other approaches have worked well and might not be ready to switch philosophies based on the courseotherwise pretty good	2
i wish i had paid closer attention to the refund policy the production quality and content did not meet my expectations	0
the course contents are pretty good but the suggested time to complete each weeks assignment is misleading i spent on average  hours for each assignment that suggested  mins to complete i end up spending way to much time on this course than i planned to	1
a very well done course from the university of michigan	4
nice course and very engaging although in virtual learning	4
very essential topics but the instructors delivery of content is inconsistent glosses over explanations at time umms and arrrs a lot talks extremely fast at times making this course quite hard to followdisclosure english if my first language not new to programming not new to mooc courses	1
the videos do not work the sound disappears and sometimes vision too otherwise it could be very promising	1
short overview of history without much of a value	0
awesome course with lots of hidden gems of insight hintons bury the lead lecturing style makes every video a treasure hunt students get to discover those pearls of wisdom if they listen carefully and read between the lines	4
instructive and fun	3
this course is really helpful learning is a skill which should be mastered by everyone and this course will guide you on how you can improve yourself and master any subject	4
explanations not clear and feels like hes reading rather than explaining thingsconsecutive videos feel like they are disconnected videos stop in the middle of him talking something thank god for the swirl assignments which make things much cleareralso the course proceed very fast not giving enough time to the concepts	0
very well presented and informative some of the early assignments are hard to grade if the person makes a small mistake and the only possible marks are  and 	3
excellent course with good relevant information	4
you must use the exact format to get the correct answer on problems or it will be marked wrongthe course is as is meaning when there are mistakes in the coursework neither web hosting nor faculty have are available to correct mistakesmoderators are not allowed to correct course content so what they end up doing is editing your post in the forum get use to this a moderator deleted your post in calculus one because of spamreview our forum code of conduct to learn more about guidelines for participating in course discussions but i and others are only posting problem areas thus rendering the forum discussions uselesssince the moderators only have the power to delete and edit your post there is a list of content errors for the course that you will need to look at real smart i asked to have my grade adjusted but they deleted that post also	0
 almost no content  all just general knowledge the instructor was very hard to follow his intonation is totally off and the sentences are broken so you cant connect the thoughts together there was no forum and thus no interaction	0
i didnt like very much the two teacher	2
the materials explaining the course are too poor this is a core course in the specializationthe quizzes are out of the materials league	1
this course is well suited for those just beginning their journey into web design but it is also a good refresher for those of us who havent played with bootstrap or explored the concepts of responsive website design	4
the best course 	4
explanation of concept was poor	1
the course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas i found the assignments frustrating and spent much of my time trying to understand what they were asking rather than actually solving the problems	2
the course is quite demanding from the get go if you are trying to get by with casual interest then this is not the course for you much of my december vacation which i had earmarked for playing video games was spent coding on this coursethe biggest gripe i have about the course is the grader system it gives a binary output indicating whether you got the question right or wrong unfortunately often that is not good enough to debug your code i spent hours figuring out whats going on the forums were also not helpful since there were not many taking the courseat the end of all this if i ask myself did i learn a lot the answer is probably no however i did get a lot of coding experience debugging experiencewe have many databases mysql mongodb cassandra etc which have far more powerful features than what pandas can do therefore as a system designer it is unclear to me as to why i would ever pick pandas over the rest it appears quite slow compared to the likes of time tested databases it offers very few features when compared to a db lastly i can use it only with python to me it appears to be a nobrainer to use any one of those dbs to store modify and massage my data maybe there are valid applications that can make use of pandas like features but i did not learn that from the coursesummarybetter motivation to use pandas over standard databasesbetter grader design	2
good high level overview for someone considering entrepreneurship or trying to map out what skills they need to prioritize if youre already in the game  skip it too basic	3
totally disappointed	0
the tests were not upto the mark where the questions were not very logical and the options were confusing	0
the audio volume throughout the videos should be improved consistently my ears were bombarded during the first shots but as soon as the sideshot plus code came into view i had to crank up the volume in order to understand what was saidotherwise it was a very well thoughtout and enjoyable class thanks	3
an excellent introduction to the world of global diplomacy from a world renowned university	4
thoroughly enjoyed this online course	3
an outstanding course with extraordinary intuition behind to make clear basic calculus many thanks for the content and especially for the creativity and motivation of the lecturer to deliver the lessons	4
the course has a lot of interesting material but i believe that a few points may be improved exercises with matlab are not programming ones except for the pd controller in my opinion more detailed exercises with a guide for solving them would help to understand better the concepts behind the theory for example programming a rimless wheel or a slip template the course has a strong emphasis in theory some of the lectures were boring an difficult to follow as i said before a more practical approach would be more rewarding quizzes were sometimes based on intuition or topics outside of the course rather than topics learned from the lessonson the other side the tas were highly involved in the course in addition an extensive list of additional resources books papers is a plusi believe that the following sessions will be better than the first one	1
a good course to understand the basics of python though theres no difference between the book chapters and the video lectures lectures are basically readings of the chapters  i expected more info in general	2
however good the material and lectures may be the use of an outdated version of octave which is not macfriendly and exceedingly brittle to the extent where the supplied code requires manual patching in windows and linux is a complete turnoff and makes it nearly impossible to complete the assignments on time unless youre prepared to spend at least twice as much time debugging your setup as doing the actual assignmentsill come back when this is done with r or python	0
good general introduction	3
an essential course that should be taken before enrolling or participating in any other study material	3
excellent intro to the social media marketing	4
good basic course for money management	2
it would be nice if you could combine the lecture notes into a single file for download	3
i wanted to like this course but and perhaps its a mathematician thing the teacher just kept doing stuff without explaining why he is doing the stuff he is very animated and a good presenter but even when i understood what he was saying i couldnt get past the why is he doing this it is never selfevident for me	1
theres in a change in the way of presenting the course i prefer the previous  section though	3
great course loved it	3
great and timely course i really enjoyed it and looking forward to the capstone	3
this was such a wonderful and informative course i love the mountains and travel frequently around the world to experience mountains in other places as much as i can the videos were put together wonderfully with different speakers and resources such a great collaborative effort education and awareness is so important for sustainability i also really enjoyed the interactive maps and tech tips really great course all around	4
good python course	3
this is an exceptional course	4
more scientific evidence would have been useful	2
till week  i think there is no useful information till now	0
i really enjoyed this course and felt like i actually learned the material the only reason i didnt give this course  stars is that due to the issue of giving away the answers to quiz questions there were a couple of quiz questions that i couldnt understand and unfortunately still dont i think this is an area that could be improved	3
the course provided almost no value  and there was almost nothing covered that you couldnt find online for free the presentation was probably the worst part of the course it was extremely boring and made it hard to get through the videosi didnt expect much practical parts in the course but there was even less than what i expected what was described as setting up a hadoop cluster consisted of downloading a preconfigured vm image and running it and then typing in a couple of commands that were provided to you again nothing of value was added and quickly going over the faq page of any of the products mentioned would be more helpful faster and a lot more interesting	0
i really enjoyed this course it both further my reading and knowledge in some areas while introducing new topics to me that id not yet encounteredmy only problem was with the final assignment  it does not do justice to the topic of the final week which is the issue of colour on ancient monuments in particular the arch of course and the implications of colour on composition and on later perceptions of antiquity the assignment itself did not give me an opportunity to really explore these issues	3
the course delivery is regrettably boring the second breaks dont work very well the lecturer is not trying to be engaging or at least pleasant to listen to i hope he lectures this way in the attempt of being clear however it comes across as being very monotonous and boring i had a strong motivation to follow the course but honestly had to drop without completing the second lecture a missed opportunity	0
firstly i think for a coursera course it is not long enough at all there are not enough assignments which motivate studying and fixing the newly learned things in the memory there are neither required nor recommended readings at all for me reading is a very good addition to the videos so that you can slowly think about the thoughts and arguments especially in a topic which is undoubtly very controversal in public as in academia like especially the history of israel and palestine from the s onwards it is important to give different narratives of history to the students there are no narratives critical to british colonialism at all mentioned instead of the white paper of  after all the course represents a very one sided an biased narrative which is presented to a global audience of students even if a certain narrative is preferred by the teaching scholars which is completely acceptable and natural not just in the field of history it nevertheless is important to cover different narratives fairly and as neutral as possible which does not happen in this course when mentioned other narratives are quickly downplayed or denied and repeatedly dichotomies like the inferior arabs the ferocity of the arab oposition and so on are mentioned or cited without beeing problematized at all nevertheless the course was a reminder of many things i learned before and brings up some interesting historic connections and key points	2
quizzes kept requiring information that was oddly specific needing an exact decimal number without multiple choice options which would have been okay except that it was not covered in the lectures ended up dropping course because there is no way to get through the quizzes if the information is not covered	0
this specialisation started off good in the first  courses but has since taken many steps back the content is dated and not well though through and it feels like the whole thing could have been put into  courses	1
bad course a lot of talking but no explainantion non of the math is explained and that is themajurity of the questions that come back in the tests	0
i really enjoyed the first two weeks when it came to javascript i couldnt follow so much information was missing and lessons were not clear anymore i understand that the goal was to teach the most in a short time but this was not the right approach	1
good intent but poor execution tries to summarize all the major topics but ends up delivering a totally disjointed cutandpaste experience with no real flow	1
i would have if possible not rated this course i was not interested in the work of the more recent photographersphoto manipulators this is a course for the art crowd not for those interested in the history of photography	2
the course is good but it has too much chinese and im not chinese	2
im sorry but i felt the week  assignment materials is not consistent to lesson videos or the lesson video does not explained enoughi think that making students think does not mean making explanation indistinct	1
not good enough	1
dear professorsinstructorstasmoderatorscodersit is very good for you to start your work in a very early time but it is so rude to send emailsnotificationsgreetingsreminders to me in a very earlylate time eg am pm during that moment i was waked up frequently by your emails which do not include a big deal	0
took this as a bit of a looks interesting  wasnt disappointed was well taught engaging and pitched at the right level id recommend it to anyone	4
i really didnt learn much too much code too complex too fast	2
lightweight and marginally informative while it is clearly aimed at a lay audience a deeper presentation of the scientific foundations of the disorder is sorely needed if youre interested in the etiology of autism youll need to look elsewhere	0
very useful to make your lerning time more efficient	4
very basic overview of the tools and installation of them should be an optional course rather than part of the specialization	2
it was quiet mathematical for a beginner like me	2
it was a good one for basic learners but there were less explanation on several topics	3
absolutely brilliant and very entertaining course which at the same time uncovers a really useful set of tools  i really liked how easy yaakov made the process of building a site look this was clearly one of the best courses that i have taken on coursera	4
very general course doesnt give much insight into data science	1
no teaching just a guy talking and sometimes complaining about imaginary students hypothetical thoughts do the problem sets for practice if you need help pause the videos and try the code out yourselfseriously though a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it he doesnt work through code but talks around the concepts	0
it was a good coursebut it was super boring as hellthats why i didnt continue learning the other modulesmost of courseras courses as boring but this was the most boring	2
i liked it very much an accomplishment diploma would have been okthank you	3
severe lack of support zero from the professor or tas some wrong solutions were provided for assigments but were never addressed or acknowledged that it will be fixed some assignment files are not mac friendly or is just not viewable by all students i cant tell materials are quite good but grading is subject to broad interpretations and there is no human to provide guidance on what are the best practices to think that i paid for the specialisation in order to take the graded assignment and i have to do the grading but i do not receive support this is ridiculous i will have to think three times before i pay for a coursera course in the future never again i will not recommend this to others	0
this course should be called intro to fundamentals of website design you may learn in the process of a few days how to create a website but not how to create a website in a weekend	0
one of the best course for learners who want coaching as well as practical work in academic writing very interesting and engaging	4
get new material  new videos these videos for all your classes are years old  the quizes dont relate to the material taught and it seems you guys got this set up years ago and just forgot about it	1
the material in this course is well presented though scarce at times however it has its share of problems little to no interaction from tas or mentors in the forumsthe quizzes are often out of sync with the lecturesthe final exam has severe problems with questions form not contentin more detail on the final exam some of the questions dont even contain all the content to answer them they can request multiple answers but have single question boxes andor the reverse	1
the video quality was so bad can not see the code clearly please update the better video	2
this course only works if u pay which is shit coz most people dont have money	0
this course offer a lot of interesting topics but the way of their presentation is not very amazing so the student loses easily the concentration	0
this was a great courseso much detail and she asked to many questions that it really makes you think and then helps you to determine how to apply it to your story amy bloom was very easy to listen to and learn from the assignments were thought provoking and definitely helped me to hone my writing skills	4
the course is very good and informative	4
very compressed but its good to have the main themes and then go deeper in each one with other courses	2
not very detailed and quite general nevertheless you get a good sense of what iot devices are and how the work for an introduction its ok but i expected more information and more assignments to make it really useful in terms of value for money id say youre better of spending a few hours on google and forums	3
too theoretical for my needs but gives a good background to how to approach analytics	2
it has a lot of nice information about the brain and ways of study but this whole course is a way of procrastinatingi feel like it could have been summed up really much better into written text and finished at a much faster rate	1
similar to other courses in this specialization the material is very nice although slightly easy and straightforward but the course instructors do not moderate the discussions enough to make them a useful tool especially when im paying for the specialization i would appreciate responses to my questions	0
good if youre really a beginner	3
this material is important but the assessment quizzes were tedious as the right answer often hung on some small obscure remark that was hard to recall	1
not practical some audio files are not working 	0
great content but making the theory of ape or chimp the origin of humans as the corner of the course and intruduce it as a truth is very wrong and shameful	1
its often not clear the point the professor of this course is trying to make instead he often seems to ramble pointing out a  little questions that a world designer might ask himselfherself during the process without ever focusing on any the reader is left not knowing what the key take aways were	0
as always great level of teaching by dr chuck but milestone tasks was not so challenging as within previous course thanks	3
short course but enough challenging and interesting i really like the short course to update my skills on web development week course are really good	4
this course is not wellpresented lectures are unimaginative and there isnt enough supporting material or readings	0
the course is too short and i didnt learn much	2
this could be improved by adding more interesting subjects  how to use list adapters with list view how to use menus how to use scrolling view etc	2
had big expectations for this one really one of the ones to look forward to after working through the beginning of the specialization but for some reason it seemed any prof or even ta interaction was absent this time around like in none of the other specialization coursed to date bugs in the new interface and quizzes werent really addressed couldnt even get an official response about the apparent removal of distinctionlevel now which id been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option still interesting content as a free course its still really valuable as one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization this is the one i felt didnt return as much value to justify the payment with no official course staff seeming to be involved this round	1
could be a useful course if youve never worked with it projects or for younger students everything seems to be about building a mobile phone app	1
capstone exercises were very ambiguous the students were left to interpret they way they had to finish and how they rated their peersthe peer reviews were poor with little to no feedback and the focus was on how the material was laid out vs what the content wasi have done other coursers and capstones in coursera this was one of the poorest uiuc has to revamp this more guidance to students in the instructions would be the first step	0
the class started with great instruction and was easy to follow coming into week  the class sped up really quick and became a lot more difficult to manage	3
this course is fun but the instructor or course admins need to put more videos contents and information to the course than just a few videos few topics per week like this the global diplomacy course should provide clearer and deeper about diplomacy than to pose what is diplomacy or what the diplomats do in their very actions of daily routines	1
great tips of time managment	4
its really informative and helpfuli will definitely recommend it	2
very low length to content ratio basic content	0
helpful course in learning	4
very helpful course i liked a lot although i would prefer for some quizzes not to be locked unless paidthank you for sharing your knowledgee	3
great topic but the course was less interesting and profound than i expected the professor could be a little more motivating worth the time though	2
very good course for beginners first step towards understanding project management  excellent presentation and content	3
excellent course  its easy and fun to learn to program	4
the most important part of this course is peer review imho so i put a lot of effort and consideration into the reviews i gave trying to make them helpful constructive and encouraging but it was not very reciprocal i did get a few great reviews very thoughtful very constructive but sometimes i only got two reviews instead of three and usually the reviews gave no criticism one review was a single word nice i got a lot more out of the other courses in this certificate i was disappointed with this one	1
more examples can be included and if assignments are in python that would be helpful as most of the high level frameworks are in python and that will build good ground work in numpy etc	3
im going to try to continue to the end but the first three weeks is probably  minutes of videos with the most annoying music available playing for way too much of the content i also didnt need to watch  seconds of an animated caveman grunting and smashing things on the screen i would probably enjoy that part more if i felt that the information that is supposed to be learned over three weeks was more information than  pages in a book	1
the instructor should spend more time putting equations and concepts into concept and tying them together it often felt like values and questions were arbitrary this is less about master data analysis in excel and more about gaining ground in a few key concepts so the title is misleading as well	2
a very good introduction to some of the fundamental and important ideas in philosophy delivered in an engaging and straightforward fashion highly recommended	3
the instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures this was a little unfair it may be the way to teach for inperson learning but it is frustrating for an online course others have commented on the rapid pace i would not mind the rapid pace if the materials presented were also the ones tested	2
although very interesting and very innovative in its presentation i had the feeling this course was an introduction to the master program at the unige rather than a stand alone course at times it was difficult to comprehend the speakers i would have preferred deepening of one aspect of this topic rather than such a broad approach	1
i feel its too simple and really just for beginners who know nothing about coding	2
the professor has a very biased view of the islamic world which is heavily based on his opinion and approach not on the real facts and dominant his	0
not the greatest python course in the world teaching seems unprofessional and disorganized technical issues are common and the discussion forums do not offer much value as you cannot discuss your code with your peers and the forum staff are more than often unhelpful the exercises are unoriginal and do not require much creative thinking  often its enough to copy  paste code from the lectures and change a few variables around youre better of looking for other python beginner courses on the coursera platform as well as on other platforms the only thing i liked about the course were the interviews with people behind python but otherwise the course does not facilitate deeper learning and is not engaging	1
as a self taught person in graphic design it was interesting to put words to my basic knowledge i found particularly helpful the lesson about composition	3
lots of readings would have loved a more engaging format also found the content slightly ambiguous you might have to do some trial and error and might be surprised at the answers in the quiz	1
i wish i could at least read the assignments if not get reviews on them in the audited version	1
sometimes is hard to follow	2
very good course	4
basic but quite useful i really enjoyed it my favorite coursera course so far	4
beware  will make you upgrade to complete quizzes and pay  should definitely be much more upfront about this from the beginningseems like very poor tactics on their behalf	0
this is an excellent course indeed access to real world data is a huge  some of the questions in the quizzes were difficult though and also the witty jokes by the prof 	4
excellent course that shows how buddhism can be rationally compared with modern psychology and how that comparison results in acceptance of its objectives rules and believes since it is a modern philosophy from hundred years ago	4
this course is very strong with respect to presenting the concepts you need to know for data science it is extremely weak in terms explaining those concepts if you are like me and did this kind of math back in the s and s but have not used it since be prepared to seek sources outside coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes the instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the conceptexample in the permutations and combinations sections results of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer  minutes later totally as an aside you get the explanation the course is not taught in such a way that a leads to b b leads to c and c leads instead the instructor will tell you about c might explain a and forget about mentioning b until the graded quiz that is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplainedcom or kahnacademycomthe student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites  where the explanations are worth your timein addition to failing to present steps in a logical order the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much much higher level again to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass any of the required graded quizzes the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources the explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correctthen there are the issues with coursera itself the course navigation using chrome is quite bad if i did not constantly monitor what part of a course i should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next i often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented the tas response to my complaint was flippant and wrong she then closed my question and i could not respond or ask for more detailsif i had it to do over again i would invest my time and money somewhere else in my opinion coursera should rescind the instructors rights to charge for this course until the instructors improve and meet higher teaching standards	0
i cant even make precourse survey which couldnt have wrong answers	0
how can you not learn and love dr okeefe	3
its a good course but not great something is missing and i cant pinpoint what	2
its alright but could be much much better i didnt feel engaged and half of the time i was just wishing the video would just end the course itself highlighted some good ideas about saving time and prioritising but the way it was presented just fell short for me	2
the course started really well and followed on nicely from the first course in the series but im really disappointed and frustrated with the video editing issues many were fixed but there are still some errorsomissions and the second half of the course was very short of content compared to the rest such a shame as im sure the writers really know their material and conveyed so well when the content was there im looking forward to the next course and hope the material is all ready to go	1
unable to submit any home work for marks	1
i didnt like the python environment i thought it will be more like ngs course nice explanations but for amateurs	1
the greatest course on finance evergautam is fantastic he makes finance understandable and fun i love his courses and his way of teaching he seems to love the subject matter and shows that he is interested and cares about delivering the material to the students so that they start appreciating it too there should be more teachers like him top course top professor	4
probably the worst class i have ever taken on coursera the teacher asked us to do tons of things without explaining how and used tons of complicated math formulas without explaining what they were what they did or when and how to use them there were also actual incorrect answers in the videos on occasion so that even if you did do things correctly you would think you were wrong and be confused and there were a lot of inconsistencies between the spreadsheets used in the videos and the methods used to solve things compared to the actual spreadsheets given to us which makes things pretty impossible to learn if youre more advanced it may be easier to find and understand the differences between the video and the spreadsheets but the whole point of this class is that it is for beginners	0
very good course	4
very disappointingtoo much emphasis on mathematical notationswhere are the practical applicationslack of examplesit seemed more of a prose than a lecturewould not recommend to a beginnerperiod	0
it is really complete and easy to follow i really loved it	4
highly detailed insight assignment makes it more interactive and thorough	3
great course fantastic the only thing that could be improved is collaboration part that feels a bit underthought description of case studies could be better in terms of what students should do	3
it is a little hard to student who not major in medicine	2
awesome course the professor uses daily analogies to simplify complex financial concepts and help learners understand the workings of the financial world	4
fantastic course	4
i think this course was way too ambitious its neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks but one should be realistic sure we had lectures explaining things but in the end we mostly had to copyandpaste code and confirm that it worked there should have been many many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understandingperhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate to really understand and absorb this stuff ill need to spend a lot of time with the additional resources the lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot but it would be hard to say i really learned very much	2
it has been amazingly helpful thanks a lot	4
an excellent course a very inspiring and effective tutor	4
one of the better programming classes definitely recommended	3
this is another course in ucsds big data introductory course the material is not pertinent to a specialty on big data technologies further the course does not increase ones knowledge of machine learning in any way that justifies spending the time in the course	0
it is an interesting course but mostly for beginners	2
thank you very much this course is so useful to me	4
i thought the course was oldfashioned it doesnt prepare you to be a journalist in the digital age where terms like crowdfunding search ability new businessmodels apps and social media are key factors of success yes there was a small section where they explained crowdsourcing lol but interviewing as many people as you can seems to be cryptosaurus approach also the social media tips seem to be very interesting if youre  its worth following this course for free but definately not your money the free course on futurelearn had ten times more content and i learned so much more	1
this course is not set up right the assignments ask you to do things that arent explained until the next weeks content its kind of discouraging in the end it does teach you the basics of r its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravatingthe reason i still only give it  stars is because of the quality of the courses itself there are many many  and  minute videos these couldve easily been combined the teacher seems unprepared in his lectures he stutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between slides this shouldnt be necessary with prerecorded lectures the assignments and quizzes are also poorly written and contain spelling and sloppy mistakes which doesnt make sense because the material isnt new it all just makes it seem like the teacher doesnt really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effortif you are not following the specialization i would not advise this course for beginners im quite surprised to see the course get such high ratings	1
good but sometimes cannot hear clearly what the tutor says whenever they have strong spanish accent	2
this course probably deserves  stars in a better maintained form but the entire specialization is not maintained the lectures have no production values basically its a money pit that coursera is keeping up cynically its a real shame because the syllabus correctly addresses a gap in most data scientists skills	1
the course is very simple	1
it was an useful course i believe that i will use the tools learned in this course	3
javascript course content can be increased	3
the content of the videos are just some engineer citing with some brief headline of security its lacking of depth and explanation totally wasting my time 	0
none of the previous classes will prepare you for this one this is not really a class but rather a project on a topic never covered in any of the previous classes in this specialization	0
this course is very useful and i really liked it it provided interesting and useful information which backed up with neurological discoveries and gave useful tips and activities for student to learn better it also listed interesting popular readings and academic journals for reference	4
what i really enjoyed in this courser is that i learned how to measure and discuss the performance of a software	4
the jupyter notebook made this a horrid experience plus coursera really doesnt want you to bother them with your silly questions relying on peerforums if you scroll through the weeks discussion forums many student posts go ignoredyou cant drop the course past the second i guess week so the system will keep on keeping on long after youve given up on trying to figure out the janky notebook thingwill not return to coursera for any reason breathtakingly bad experience	0
amazing class	4
opening the quizes and the internal acreditation for free should be a most for such a good course like thisits a shame that non premium users have access to only the video material	2
missed agile framework and other emerging techniques	2
i am learning from this course and thats far more better	3
the course requires good knowledge of statistics as a prerequisite	0
amazing course with lots of good information especially i have cleared my concepts on o  g price economics after learning through this course	4
i liked fun videos some explanations and teachers but the quality has really disappointed  a huge amount of misprints in printable exercises a few grammar mistakes in the answers mistakes in the execution of the online exercises the part about passive tenses is only about one tense past simple and the whole design is really destructing awful typefaces different styles different colors i enjoyed some explanation in videos and fun teachers but in general im really happy i havent paid for this course	1
i had very high hopes for this course i was actually planning to purchase the specialization  just as a thank you gesture unfortunately there is very little to be grateful for herein this course you get a series of super short lectures giving you an overview of the math and physics behind the aerial robotics i cant be the judge since i hold a degree in this area but i dont think youll be able to get much if you arent familiar with the topics yet and you most certainly wont learn anything new if you had some previous trainingand then suddenly there are assignments that have almost nothing to do with the lectures but require quite a bit of matlab programming did i mention you wont be taught any matlab in the process to make things worse the assignments are rather poorly explainedby the way you wont get any replies from the course team  they even ignore questions about errors in lecturesthe course looks very sloppy as if someone forced the team to put together something for coursera a huge disappointment 	0
very well explained i was able to follow easily the basics are there the tutorials were very valuable would be nice if the cours was updated by more modern topics like deep learning	3
general and shallow not very informative could be inspirational for those havent cooked in a long time recipe are at the end of course	1
i didnt like the professors teaching style he took way more time than was necessary to get his points across plus the little quips where hes pretending to engage with the viewer made it feel like a kids show there were some good nuggets of info but there was too much filler to get to it	1
excellent introduction to big data and hadoop practical exercise reinforces materials	3
i learned a lot from this course	4
good overall beginner course but definitely for the beginners only the last week may be interesting to people that already know a bit about html and css as the javascript part at the end has some interesting assignments like hiding an image in another image	3
why the whyunderstanding the reasons behind things is why this is a  stars course	4
this course is dimensional and not of high didactic quality i have followed several other courses  also python in coursera set up and this one really disappointed me  im in wk  out of  now it is a bit of a pitty that the instructor speaks too rapid  it is ment to be also for nonnative us speakers the material is hardly explained step by step so what i do at the moment i watch the video and than go to yuotube to find other videos that deal with the topics in an easier and didactic better wayexamples of good cousres in my opinion are stats and probabilty course and the python courseps all of the data toolbox course seem to have the same flawsof course my knowledge level is low concerning programming  i am a md so hardly scientific educated nevertheless i hope this feedback can be of any good	1
great introduction to statistics presented in a very interesting and engaging way	3
fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course the balance of instruction to exercise was very low i also resent being sent to raw bootstrap documentation if i could have read that i likely wouldnt be taking the course it makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had  minutes of lectures  minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something newupdate im also impressed by mr muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews	1
the subtitles were bad not in sync with the words of the professor and were wrong in many casesdelivery of lecture and visuals of the lecture was okmodule   were very confusing and not interestingthank you professor for your time and effort	1
while the lectures were a little slow about providing information they were entertainingbut i feel very mislead about the costs the lecturer repeated over and over how everything is free but in the end only the first course in the series is free then you must pay a monthly fee in order to go oni would not have continued with the first course if id known that was all there was going to be	0
can be packed into a twoweek course	1
an interesting documentary but i wouldnt call this a university course quite annoying the continuous advertising of the professors book	1
joined this course as i was really interested in understanding meditation itself from a scientific perspective the monotonous drone of the instructors combined with the super low volume that one has to strain to hear the extra extra long essays which read like one long chapter less novel the videos which extend what couldve been covered in  minutes to nearly  all take the interest away unclear if this was intentional  intended to enable participating students to be more patient and tolerant of imperfections around them	0
many problems and mistakes found in the assignment programs and i felt a lack of staff assistance on helping solving them	1
the course was interesting but overall very wide and didnt make a clear point	2
simply not as engrossing as i had hoped it would be	1
i wish the course would give me more structured information and examples of applications	2
a very friendly course which digs very deep into the core mathematics behind machine learning i was very interested in autonomous vehicles and this course enables me to figure out the steps that i have to take to achieve my goal this course helped me have an intuitive understanding of how machine learning algorithms work	4
thank you for a very structured and approachable introduction to the language	4
i am loving this course the instructor is great helpful and knowledgeable i am already confident that i will learn a great deal about pr from this one course i plan to enroll in the specialization	4
didnt learn anything	0
worth doing but hardly enough content for  weeks	2
this course presents an overview of different machine learning tools but i rather prefer starting from the second course were more specific competencies are given i believe that in courses like this the contents are to sparseit would serve as an introduction but the contents of week  and  are not even in the specialization	2
need to record the sessions again with more confidence and less errors	0
hopeless  less clear and understandable than simply reading a textbooka waste of time	0
didnt learn very much	2
i like this course because it was jumping directly into latest and greatest of frameworks or libraries and making things easy to get startedthe instruction give on assignment wasnt clear	3
im not finishing it since in the test are missing a lot of sounds 	0
dr dixon really knows how to teach stuff excellentthe reason i give it  stars is because it could give us some real examples of inclass applications of all the useful techniques taught it would really help us enrich our inventory of teaching techniques	3
very basic overview no real meat on these bones	1
is a little basic introduction to infosec but is nice a good to start	2
this type of course structure may work at an undergrad level but for continuing education it is subparthe video lectures were the instructor reading the slides reading from the course reading or showing videos that were listed in the course reading the course quizzes had too many questions that focused on memorizing details from the case studies or a statistic shown for a bit in the lectures rather than try to foster understanding of the materialthere were some technical issues such as links from the course readings expiring and not being replaced inlecture questions dealing with a subject matter different from the topic of the lecture etcthe one good thing from this course  it uses a great textbook free which provides lots and lots of useful data and insights into digital marketing  and this is the sole reason the course gets  stars instead of 	1
it was fun to learn a language which i considered to be difficult	4
this really is a good extention to the calculus one course a bit harder to understand but i assume this was the main idea of jim fowler  to explain as he mentions in one of the videos that mathematics is not about calculations  its about insight so be prepared for less technical calculations in the tests and more creative thinking on how to solve this or that problem	3
good lectures but the rlab is horrible do not take this class	0
really unhappy with how difficult and over complicated it is i came here to learn about excel pivot tables functions the course really loses focus and its unfortunate that i am now stuck here and cannot continue the entire specialization	0
assighnment is partly possible only with classmate who has full knowledge of python	0
the assignment code is ambiguous and the assignment is not clear the lecture is not much helpful than i thought it would be overall i would not recommend this course if you dont need the certificate	0
very good basics one star dropped for being a little too theoretical sometimes would have been nice to know more why some things are the way they are in the body	3
i do not recommend this course it did not fill my expectations i am not able to create application for mobile phone after finishing itfirst  modules were somehow useful but since module  onward it is just waste of time i did not learn anything useful i did not learn how to code advices for sources were very shallow and it was not shown how to work with them i could gain same information with basic search engine requestthe teacher is nice and willing to give information to students but unfortunatelly he did not prepare for recordings of videos his speeches lacked structure and focus very often he was lost in talking and he often reexplained in detail staff which was already explained in previous videos this caused that videos were too long considering the amount of knowledge that was provided to students and watching them was waste of timethe course was shallow information did not go deep students participation was not supported nor required after  module	0
great practical exercises and content i learned a ton really having fun with the classes	4
they dont give enough inputs and instructions to complete the assignments unless they could offer addicional material	0
excellent course highly recommended	3
no stars for this course  modules i did and i think is not a valuable course gives a bad introduction to the language there are inconsistencies in the theory and knowledge of the language the preparation of the course is poor there is no direction a lot of errors using playground and the instructors hesitate and doubt all the time during the recording of the screen thats not good point for the prestigious university of toronto and coursera one star for the review is too much no preparation lack of security bad quality	0
i dont think it could be better very demanding and interesting you will certainly learn a lot if you take this course	4
the contents of the course were very good it is essential material that everyone should learn about as early as possible in their life it should be essential learning in each school all the material is based on scientific facts there are however reasons why i did not rate this course with  points the amount of material takes a lifetime to digest and adopt to cram this into a few weeks was not the appropriate way to teach it there were way too many videos one was supposed to watch within a single week sometimes even the summary videos for a single week took  minutes that is just not right i was so busy memorizing the material that i did not find the time to adopt it in my daily life what a pity it will take me many months to really digest the material	3
the instructors explanation is not orderly nor structured and with a lot of noises	1
this is not a beginners course so a decent grasp of the r language is necessary it is best to take this course after some stints with data camp swirl or code school	2
very good course for getting a high level understanding of the machine learning concepts	3
i was somewhat disappointed in this course as i expected much more practice the assignments did not have you actually perform any analytics activities the course materials seem very out of date considering how much things change in the digital age reading blogger posts from  on a blogger blog that hasnt been updated since  is not forward thinking in my view yes things dont always change but the face of analytics changes daily	2
a good course taking into account that it does not require previous knowledge i am giving only  stars because for a basic no previous requirements course i would expect much more additional readings on the other hand if you have programming or database experience you will find some topics too basici have liked it more than the first course on the specialization but i would expect more details i think general topics are well explained	2
awesome thank you andrew	4
probably more useful for someone with no background in programming	2
i found the presentation of the topic very convincing ill try to foster micromoments of positivity resonance in the future and i am fully convinced that this will have a significant positive impact on my lifethe videos were good not too long and each making a point im not a big fan of the round table format but i admit it was appropriate for the topicthe only aspect where i see room for improvement is the type of assignments the quiz was part of the course but the weekly exercise was not it is maybe worthwhile to create some little assignments with a peerreview to foster a deeper investment of the participants into the course	3
it was halful	0
applications exercises are allocated within specific areas of larger scripts which allows the student to complete small tasks that are still put into context of a general projectthe lessons are well illustrated and developing intuitions of the mathematical concepts is well facilitated	3
i dont like to tie quiz to the paid course	2
miniproject grades system is awful btw you have to wait till three students review you project one more point is that the contents of videos are not that enough you can just read the required textbook to get all knowledge and examples	1
i really did not like the portion that went into detail about business analytics and related career paths not a technical skill or ne	1
i expected more week  on streams in my opinion was a very strong week and well worth time and effort week   and  were pretty weak in my opinion i dont feel like ive learned much or that the exercises reflected what was being taught in the lectures for example on week  the exercises do nothing with futures even though theres  lectures on them week  spends  long lectures how to build a discrete simulation application and exercises are about property checking course felt disjointed and not really finished would not recommend and definitely would not pay  usd for	1
this course is absolutely incredible if youre looking for new perspectives about learning process here is the first step to reach your success on everything you propose yourself to learn	4
problems with vitual machine for r assigment for peer review detail evaluation guidelines is need	2
videos kept cutting out either entirely or the sound would cut out made it very difficult to follow	1
absolutely fantastic program professors are the best	4
this course basically treats you like an extremely slowlearning retarded individual totally waste of your time by watching a bunch of videos the contents are so thin all the contents covered in these course videos can be summarized in a minute video if you have a lot of time you dont know how to spend enroll in	1
im in the data science specialization statistical inference was my th course all of them have been on a spectrum of good to great but statistical inference is a mixed bag for mefirst if you are thinking about this course take some time reading the other reviews i find many of them resonate with my experience leading to  starsone reviewer who gave  stars said they loved the course they suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out i dont find this to be the case many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the courseanother reviewer enjoyed brians dry humour i must have missed the jokes after watching each video  timesfor the record i almost aced this course the reason for not getting  was because i was so annoyed with one of the quizes that i didnt bother taking it again to correct it i decided living with  correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points yes that is how much i hated this coursethe first  weeks of the course were the worst i dropped out for about a month because of life priorities then i couldnt get motivated  month turned into  months then into  months i basically took the entire summer off finally i bit the bullet and completed the final  weeks the rd week of the course wasnt actually all that bad though the quiz was terrible the th week felt like the first  weeksterribleby the way its a mistake to take such a long break i had to rewatch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzesif you dont have some sort of statistical knowledge or inherent aptitude be prepared to work four times longer on the course for all your quiz and assignment timetocompletion estimates multiply them by  or more seriously i spent probably  hours on the final assignment which said it should only take  hours each quiz took me an entire sunday afternoon my partner was not pleasednow here is where things get awkward i hated the course  buti learned things that actually stuck so in that regard i give this course extra stars it accomplished something that some university courses could not i even found myself using the new knowledge in real world problems so ironically is that not a sign that its dare i saya good coursewould i take the course again i actually might but only because of its place in the overall certification if you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course i dont think i could recommend it because there are far better ways to learn in fact just doing the swirl lessons could be good enoughif you are a prospective student and you want the certification then youll have to take the course why are you even bothering to read reviewsso im giving the course  stars if i gave it  or  stars my review would be clustered with the majority if i gave it  or  stars id be lying	2
this course was really good but not too deep i went on to study the cissp manual and some additional training this is a great course if you want an introduction to cybersecurity	2
way to much emphasis on nondata science this one course covers more information that the rest of the courses combined	1
i think this course is good but it short and expensive	3
good one	3
not much here	0
the ask in the fist assignment was not formulated correctly felt the class needed more hands on learning although the lectures were clear and concise going back to them really didnt help me with the assignments	1
i dont need the teacher to read aristotle for me reading is not teaching	0
mismatch between assessment and course content after not being able to pass the assessment ive fallen behind on the course and im too busy to catch up	1
its resource full and informative	3
most of the content was included in functional programming in scala and reactive programming principles in scala	2
awesome course	4
professor jim fowler is amazing great scientist with this sense of humor that inspires me to study math moremore more	4
this course is poorly taught the instructors often speed through significant concepts and are generally unable to explain the concepts clearly to someone who does not have a major statistics background	1
the lessons are amazingly interesting	4
no use at all	0
great introduction to the topic built on the last course and deepened my r knowledge a lot	3
i loved this course i was a little familiar with some of the concepts before but mr severances commentary helped answer some of the questions i had about it i have a much more solid foundation and understanding than before	4
the video lectures are not very polished and i think it would have been better to have a few longer videos than so many short ones	1
i am working as an organisational consultant and thought this would add some knowledge  however it is really difficult to follow because it seems repetitive to me i have paid for the certificate and still it is difficult for me to focus it seems there is too much information and too much talk for things that are easily understood and do not need all this going over and over again i got bored by the time i got to week  and it is seems impossible to stay focused and complete all assignments i hope this changes in my third and last chance to get the certificate	2
very happy and positive about taking this course builds up my confidence about speaking hanguel language and very good material for learning	4
i think it is a really good course unfortunately too advanced for someone that is just starting to play the recorder and recognises the notes and so on also the fact that the notes are abcdefg instead of doremifa made thinks a little bit confusing for me i learnt some stuff until rd week where started to be quite complicated th week was frustrating maybe in the future ill come back to it	3
i would rename this course as programming octave with application to machine learning rather that machine learning once you start the course you will have to focus on octave rather than on ml topics if you want to do programming exercises there is no degree of freedom in programming you are provided with a lot of weird octave codes which you will have to complete instead of writing yourself from scratch more than  of my time was spent in order to learn octave and understand guess octave codesso if you really want to learn ml and try it in practice this course is not for you however you could just watch the videos whose level is not more that elementary introduction to ml	0
nice class with dr chuck	4
while the instructors may be well versed in their fields i felt the course took too long to get to the meat of the issue i suppose i wanted a fasterpaced course without a lot of handholding	1
there are no lectures on services and content providers which are two key components of the android system it really disappointed me	2
the course information was fairly useful but the execution not so much the material spent more time on somewhat repetitive examples than it did on explaining the actual concepts those examples were illustrating and the videos were primarily just lecturers reading parts of the slides that you had already read but in their own wordsthe tests sadly were poorlydesigned for the subject matter of the course behavioral biases  like many psychological phenomena  overlap to some degree and the frequentlyused format of choose all that apply  or worse choose all that might apply  resulted in trying to guess what the testsetter was looking for rather than trying to apply the information that had been learned when you find yourself trying to decide between the best answer based on what you have learned and a conceptually worse answer that happens to meet the wording of the question  and trying to guess whether the testsetter is looking to prove your understanding or catch you in a mistake  then you start to suspect that the course has been designed more as a way to earn grades than to actually learn	2
course content and assignments were difficult to follow loads of statistical content along with highlevel r content means it was probably the toughest of the  i have taken so far in the coursetrack	1
this course is very difficult for beginners	1
excellent explanation and practical assignments	4
awesome job by margaret	4
too basic cant even do the quiz without payment	1
thanks	4
i did not find the lectures at all informative and the readings were not targeted enough to understand what items required focus and what information was more background i did not find the course especially helpful	0
very good introduction to agile processes and practices	4
due to change from xcode  to  important parts of these lectures are outdates hence it get complicated to follow the course	1
slow and redundant would have preferred a fasterpaced and more substantive course	1
i would not recommend this specialization to anyone the first assignment is just a first review of the final project but it is almost impossible to pass because the questions are not organized in a manner of constructive feedback	0
this course was delivered months behind schedule and the assignments halfway through the course cant even be completed due to technical problems and sloppy content when students try to seek support to fix the issues nothing is done and they receive no response the specialization started so well but the care that was taken to craft the specialization course content in the beginning has been lost in the later courses	0
the instructors approach in this course is very cursory he tries to split the difference in going through the mechanicsmathematical theory and practical applications as a result he fails at both i think it would be better to leave the mathematics and application learning to supporting materials and focus on explaining the theory and concepts of statistical inference in the lectures	1
this course lay down a solid foundation for the virtual education specialization on which you can build a great practice in the field	3
practical and immediately applicable  language and activities to start your positive classroom participants are dedicated and the assignments offer insightful opportunities to explore concepts and create content for your classroom	4
open your mind to broad your mind	3
great content but too much video for me since i prefer reading about it	3
the best online course ive ever attended the explainations are crystal clear even for nonmethematicians and the topic is widely covered  no deep learning nor bayesian methods though if only my former college teachers wouldve been half that good	3
salute to the instructor	4
the cpurse is for someone who eants pure programing in my case i want python for predictive procedures	3
interesting firstintroduction to financial markets	3
course content feels upside down youll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve	1
fascinating knowledge delivered by instructors whose first language is definitely not english and who make it difficult to learn by their bad grammar pronunciation and overall monotonous tone of speaking however the knowledge gained in this course is fascinating and i am thankful to the instructors for attempting to instruct more people in regard to this field and the details of it	2
the course is as much about computer programming as it is about statistics the statistics i can do with pen and paper the programming i found very very unhelpful and confusing eventually i gave up on the course	0
its a very helpful and interesting course	4
great and inspiring course	3
its not a course this is a very short general introduction to d printing	0
a good introductory course to pythonintended for real beginners	3
learnt alot of new things even though id say ive got experience in this field evaluation and conducting interviews as part of principles is a fresh way to look at how we understand design  recommended	4
awful teacher and explanation and material	0
so why four stars vs five stars of all the data science certification courses that i have taken i some of the examples and quiz challenges dont work as they should ii machine learning is rapidly changing area  should be updated to reflect this and perhaps a high level taste of deep learning iii posting the final project is overly complicated relative to methods of the other courses  this should be cleaned up  still not clear how point to a github repo link and also have a rendered html page working from that same link  requires two links to present materials and must use default names like index vs a project name	3
very good intro to maths	4
a very clear break down on the state of arts on iots i wanted to polish my knowledge on iot this course gave me a very clear idea and brought my attention on how lacking security is in the current state of affairs at least the magnitude is astonishingi especially enjoyed the read on regulating iot law paper i know we are to cover only a few pages but the rest of the paper is just as interesting thank you	4
very complete	4
the actual educational aspects of the course are interesting and insightful but the requirement to grade the work of others makes this course a chore to get through if the material wasnt so useful i would have rated this course  if the peer review requirement did not exist it would easily have warranted a  rating	1
i expected some more coding in the capstone rather than just apply code that has already been written	2
это не курс а набор эзотерических бездоказательных практик которые способен придумать для себя даже школьник учителя павла кочкина о которых сам он с гордостью рассказывает  норбеков и лапин псевдоученый с псевдостепенями и тантрист это курсераthis is not a course for coursera its a shame that this kind of nonscientific blabber found its way onto this platform the techniques pavel kochkin is promoting are basic to say the least his teachers are a known quack and a tantrist and pavel himself is proudly telling his story of how he lied his way into a job for which he had no skills hes giving false definitions to personality and intrinsicextrinsic motivation hes confident hes got presentation and cute animation but his message is just as quack as his teachers i am shocked and disgusted and on top of that theres a lot of selfadvertisement and links to pavels online coursesits a shame mephe put its label on this course its tragic that coursera swallowed it as well	0
it gives an interesting general view of the financial market and the guest lecturers contribute with very interesting views about the professional financial world and the causes to the recent financial crisis very good as an overview	3
a lot of powerpoint nothing else	0
nice and comfortable dive into world of ruby on rails very pleased	4
it was a bit hard to follow the instructions	2
there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos which is fine and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audienceto solve these problems i have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for helpi agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practiceyou cant slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand much harder than anything seen during class and expect me to do it in  hours per week maybe  hours per daydisappointed i wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but i will most likely try to get back the money i spent on this and let it go	0
very good course thanks for coursera thanks for andrew ng	4
the course is very simple so far hope its just because its the first one in the specialization love the teaching style	3
poor course never give any algorithm no clue where the problem come from the forum is only help a few people no general ideas how to solve the problem waist a lot of time debugging but still couldnt pass the assignmenttotal waste my time and garbage course	0
good course for beginners ive picked up the nuances of branding via reading materials outside of this course through my professional network etc and hence i was expecting more from the coursealso i would like to mention that the quality of video lectures can significantly improve as some videos that were shot in an external location had too much noise and it was a distraction to focus on the lecture	2
i previously gave this course a star review however upon realising that there is no way to access the classroom after receiving the final grade and certificate i simply cant give it the same excellent review i have no way of accessing discussions and my final assignment to see any feedback classmates have given there is also no option to retake the final assignment which was peergraded and i believe i was not properly evaluated by my peers	2
save your money and just work through the free galaxy  tutorials on the galaxy site i found that the lecturers sometimes used random terminology without ever explaining it for example tags is another word for sequencing reads but this is only ever used in rnaseq methodology and then only rarely also the final peer reviewed project isnt explained very well and uses tools and methods that arent even within the scope of the module mostly just a waste of time	0
the final project did not require use of the material in the course beyond the first week and a half i did not take any quizzes or otherwise have my knowledge tested on the material in the second half of the course	1
this course needs a total overhaul in its current state it is a detriment to both coursera and the wharton online brand first there was relatively little content there was less than an hour of lectures each week and no actual programming involved second the material was pitched at a very basic level but not in a good way third the tests didnt manage to even test the material being covered for example when given a mean and stdev when asked to find a value often the lecture would use an approximation  ie a tailed  distributed   std devs  this is a class on excel there is no excuse for not introducing normsinv and normsdist when asking that question when the test required the approximation rather than the exact calculation everything about this course was wrong it needs to be scrapped and thrown away	0
great course good insight on business analytics	4
i like that it took the knowledge id acquired over  years of working in the technology field and applied it to the new organized business analysis field that has become the norm	3
to be completely honest i was expecting more from this course one big setback is that the course material does not really go into biochemical fundamentals of what is going on and instead jumps straight into algorithms this might work for someone with enough background in biology who needs to learn to code i on the other side have already had some exposure to software development and algorithms but when pavel mentions gene expression and transcription i have a very vague idea what he is talking about	2
very basic collection of concepts not too much practical exercices	1
really great course which helps to understand basics of data tidying ive also enjoyed regex explanation its really clear	4
mr sverance is so funny and humorous the class is easy to unserstand	4
this comical man makes me very annoy	1
teaches you java in a toy environment blue jay would be helpful to learn java in eclipse or another ide that you would normally work in	0
a great course for helping you understand how your mind works i have learned that learning need not be something laborious but rather it can be a fun journey with the right tools and techniques i look forward to applying what i have learned to all aspects of my life not just in my formal education	4
i found this course is very much theoritical i should have included mathatical models and ways to relate them with our day to day lifethanks	0
ill give two stars cause lectures are way to boring to follow	1
it was a good class to begin with however it would have helped to tailor it more towards newcomers to programming language in general i also would have like it if roger would have highlighted or circled or something to specify where in the slide he was talking about i felt that at times it was hard to follow where exactly he was talking about and what part of the codefunction he was mentioning im a visual learner and that would have been greatly beneficial	2
prof andrew ng explains the main ml concepts in a very concise yet detailed manner that allows both students with a background in cs and those without it to learn so much in this course the class is well structured and the assignments are amazing examples of the applications of the concepts learned	4
it was helpful and taught everything you would need to know	4
i wish the javascript lesson had more examples specially for the material at the end of the lesson functions returning functions etc	3
toughest class in the offering there really couldve been  classes for cleaning data i struggled with the lecturers style spoke too fast	2
extremely inspiring	4
the videos were pretty goods but a bit too slow and easy the assigments were ok but too guiding also there were too much reimplementation of algorithm	2
very limited content not possible to complete the projects at the end 	0
good but not as good as the other modules in the specialisation the instructions for the assignments are a bit too convoluted clarity would be added not by adding more information but by reducing the text	3
interesting and topical from people who were in the thick of things and dont pull punches the camerawork leaves a bit to be desired but not the content	4
this is the second week being finished and i am so happy to follow this course it is really great	3
the machine learning methods introduced in this course are very powerful and the course was taught in a way thats easier to understand	4
poor video quality weak ad hoc examples not well thought flow seems like tutors have not spent time on proper preparation free courses on itunesu especially those by stanford university are far more better	1
just pid in matlab and not very well explained	1
this course had a lot of depth to it both in the lectures and the programming assignments the last assignment seemed needlessly complex with not enough focus on the parallel programming aspect i wish there had been more of a focus on how to actually write the parallel and task constructs which were instead given already implemented without much explanation	3
i have enrolled in many classes on coursera but can not finished any of them because they all get boring at the end its my st course that i have finished because from first to last this course remain interesting to me and got no chance to be bored m adam is the best course instructor to me till now i wish i could do her classes live because she knows how to teach on mooc this course is no only interesting but also highy educative this course should start give certificate of accomplishment thank you 	4
this course is very sparse on details and just a week of content the lecturer is not the best at explaining concepts	0
good concept and such a true message hard to realize and for sure finally the only way to get slim and stay slim	3
great course i really like the explanations it really makes sense	4
not very engaging i ended up just reading the notes as videos were slow and took too much time not enough pathophysiology or treatment details for me as a healthcare provider disappointed after taking a previous course which was wonderfulstudent conversations and dialogue from around the world	1
i am writing to thank professor michael for his great course i considered this class one of my favorite courses this class honestly gave me a new understanding of the world his lectures were always so well organized and easy to understandhis excellent teaching skills helped me a loti learned so much from professor michael and i look forward to learning more many thanks for being a remarkable teacher best regards raed bin sadan	4
i thought it was a great course it really prompted me to consider the different aspects of the political landscape and how it will look drastically different in the coming years as my generation enters into the field i recommend this course as a good starting ground for those wanting to gain more perspective for those considering the public service route	3
great course for intermediate level it can be more indepth	3
really good course about the dos and donts of the day to day management of a team	3
by far the best course i have seen in coursera i have bought the book downloaded every video and engrossed myself in it captivating	4
this course is the worst course that i have taken so far i am not happy with the course content and the way that the lecturer uses to teach this course i really want to refund my money	0
a good course for introduction too simple and too little exercise	3
very insightful thanks	3
the content was useful and i do feel a foundation is being setthe area where i think the course fell short is on the support we got from mentors or instructors in the forum basically null  pun intended there are some points where its easy to fall into a rabbit hole like i did without support a simple challenge supposed to take a few minutes can turn into hours days	2
a quite simple beginning might end up being a little bit too simple the future looks promising though	2
great course	3
clustering topic is covered superficially too much time spend on employing ggplot graphs not very useful since making graphs is straightforward on other software like excel once you aggregate datasets correctly i had not found it very enriching as a course i would merge this class within rprogramming section and call it part  rather than categorizing into exploratory data analysis	1
awesome course	4
i have absolutely no idea how could this become a separate course  and one spread over  weeks it is extremely basic extremely general and extremely high level it should be compressed to  hours and added as an _optional prerequisite_ to other courses in this specialization i personally feel cheated out of my  usd star	0
really learnt a loti wish they conduct more couses on architecture as well	3
the course seemed not to be prepared with anticipation i left it because of that	0
nice but not the best	3
good high level understanding of analytics	2
i give this course  star not  star because the level of programming assignments are bit difficult as compared to level discussed in lecture videos although lecture videos are very informative but beneficial only for very basic level programming and to solve these programming assignments lots of learning is needed	2
might be useful for total newbies but this was very simple for me	1
no accurate help no feedback on the graders  out of  assignments where not specified correctly or just wrong this course will only teach you to be frustrated	0
topic and approach are interesting however the disturbinglymodulated voice and exaggerated accent of the professor can get a bit unbearable at times and make lectures arduous to follow and enjoy	2
poorly designed and explained you do not really gain much knowledge from this coursei would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course there are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices	0
wasnt much of a class about responsive design only one of the four weeks talked about responsive web design much of the class was about parts of building sites that arent relevant to building a responsive site the week that discussed responsive design just talked about using bootstrap	1
the course is just awesome	4
just about okay wouldnt recommend to pay for this	2
a little bit ambiguous and vague however it gets better in the next sessions in my opinion	3
c	0
the subject seems so interesting but we need more historical information its nice to have a personal point of view but it is difficult to follow the process then	0
this level of detail was good for easier statistical concepts but there are much better courses on coursera for machine learning	2
the information was presented so slowly that it was hard to follow i have taken a couple other introductory biologygenetics courses so some of the information was familiar but i and a friend who watched over my shoulder found the videos nearly unwatchable due to the slow pace the presenters were speaking	1
this is a great course taught by a clever teacher butthe content is presented in a very dry not easy to grasp manner in several cases i had to use external sources to understand the content andor derive it by myself when i finally understood the content i couldnt understand why it is presented in such a cryptic manner when the concepts are rather simple to grasp and the math not so advancedprofessor caffo is a good communicator in some occasion the module on power for example was incredibly well communicated but most of the time he just throw us some result without properly setting the context and concepts as if it was understood that we already know most of what he is talking about not the casei plan to make a document that follows the course module and fill in the missing piece of contextual information derivations and concepts but this takes a lot of time ifwhen it will be completed i will try to find a way to share it with future generation of students because honestly the content of this course is not so hard and shouldnt be	2
really confusing and struggled a lot the course doesnt prepare you for the final project	0
amazing course i loved this course and it helped me a lot and is going to help me more and more and more	4
almost nothingis it a courseso frustating after one weeknot details	1
excelent course much of your time will be needed to do the assignments	4
switching back and forth between linux and android is going to be problematic it adds an unnecessary complexity to the course and adds extra skill set requirements which were not mentioned as needed ahead of time while they say you can choose one or the other later lessons will only use one or the other it switches and this causes issues if you actually intend to follow along and learn something	2
not worth your time or money	0
need some extra work in order to get this certification	3
i do not like this course being tied to a commercial product in my opinion it should be using an open source python library and not focusing on the dato product	1
i really love the way dr chuck is teaching it is incredibly clear and you never get bored even if each lecture is over  minutes long after each lecture you do feel like youve become an expert in that topichowever the course is very diluted only  lectures over  weeks is too little content especially if you are to pay the  required for certification each week contains a lot of videos that although being interesting are not directly relevant to the course i finished the whole thing in  days 	2
a wonderful course as a father and a sports nutritionist i am always thinking how to make my son eat better healthier thank you team standford for putting together this great course	4
a brief discussion to the questions asked in between the video lecture might be useful for those who got it wrong	3
dr moerman is passionate about qualitative research and does use some interesting examples to illustrate his ideas some of which are drawn from his own research experiences do note that if you were to take this course you need time because the assignments are time consuming and the videos are i think a little longer than they really need to be also some of the assignments are designed in a pretty strange way eg one weeks assignment requires a shocking  peer reviews to pass but when i took the course there were only a few submissions this probably means i cant get my cert until the next session starts  if im lucky	1
great course it brings a clear understanding of the project management base principles and guides you through risk management and budget accounting fundamentals	4
mistakes during the videos are only corrected in its review often theres a new attempt of andrew ng to say something without even cutting out the first attempt the mathematical symbols sometimes didnt encode at all the quality needs to be redone as this was not a completely satisfying experience for an usd course	1
amazing course	3
very basic things any examples for regression	2
too much of introduction can easily cut down of that when you first listen to it  there is no way to remember all the details	3
the topics and tools provided in this course are effective and help to unlock greater potential as a student and as an individual i plan on retaking this course as a refresher at least once in the future it has been quite a positive experience	4
awesome course content nice explanation by the tutor must for beginners who want to have a start with angularjs grunt gulp and other tools	4
one of the best course on mooc platforms thx and good luck	3
good information and great instructor	3
i wasnt as challenged as i thought i would be with the capstone course	1
the course material was quite boring i have gained some theoretical knowledge about problem solving and decision making techniques but we werent given enough practical examples on how we should apply these techniques at work i wish the lecturer had t suggested additional material on the topic	1
because of this course i am more aware of opportunities to negotiate in my every day interactions with others i enjoyed professor siedels teaching style he gets you to think on a deeper level especially when he poses questions and presents scenarios the course material is framed in a comprehensive manner in hindsight this course on negotiation has shown me how much of a poor negotiator i was however i now feel more empowered by what ive learned	4
awesometruly awesomeprofessor severance aka dr chuck is an amazing teacher explaining the content in a clear yet engaging way  truth is it gives the impression of being a wonderful human being toutcourt the coding exercises are very well crafted and show how to use tiny python snippets to carry out heavy tasksso if youve never really sat down to learn regexes or if you want to have a minimal web crawlerscraper running in less than one hour this class might be your cup of tea	4
the only attractive thing in this course is a name of the author the course itself is poorly designed homework is hardly connected to the content of lectures might be interesting as an introduction for scala newcomers though	2
the subject of this course is awesome and very interesting but the effort that berklee put into it is nothing compared to what they give to students on their official website i completed a certificate with berklee online and i do not recommend this course  but i do recommend berklee online courses with written lessons and interactive worksps the videos stop all the time and this makes it harder to follow what the teacher is saying	1
as a basic course on html css and javascript is really concise and pragmatic	4
the lecturers are speaking very fast some times at the code practice it is not understandable how to solve the problem	1
im in week   cant master data analysis in excel	0
 weeks was a bit of a rush to get everything done but the course was very informative and met expectations	3
great course for learning the basics of game development and getting into the unity d game enginesuggestion the workload needs to be re organized the first two weeks need little to no efforts while the last two weeks are more intense	3
the last assignment of the course is compared to the others more difficult in my case i ran into several errors which i couldnt get help in solving by using the course forum as the end of course deadline was just a few days ahead i had to analyze the tweet texts for the last graded assignment without using spark framework nor any of the other big data tools explored in the coursei also found some of the videos by phd amarnath gupta were difficult to understand his examples were unclear and in my opinion too complex and difficult to follow and understand what was the reasoning thread	1
good lectures but no exercises or assignments leaves a flat and unrealistic image of the subject	1
though i use ms excel on daily basis but this course has shown me new ways glad i joined in	3
no good without the missing course and capstone projects	0
this was a good course a little hard to follow at times but very beneficial	2
a very poor course the teacher just ask questions in order to stimulate students but doesnt teach anything incorrect terminology ahah please study aaron allston works before inventing other wordstest are cool	1
i have studied some bayesian statistics before i feel like the materials itself is not sufficient for entry level and will actually confuse some of the learners anyway this is just my two cents 	0
great course thanks	4
this course provides clear and crisp additionsmodifications in our daily life style that can bring about significant changes instructor illustrates these solutions by means of very simple yet powerful examples and provides useful monitoring techniques thatll one help become more productive all in all this is a good course one must take to learn or if you already know then refresh the ideas to become more productive	3
i didnt learn anything more than what i already knew which was basic concepts and was able to pass anyway im very disappointed i want to be a good programmer and this did not teach me any programmingthe videos are not conducive to learning you need a more engaging teaching plan dont just read slides to me i can do that myself use videos to explain concepts but stuff your videos with practice problems put more code in the videos and walk me through it put in miniquizzes in the middle of videos to keep the student aware of how they are doing in short increments dont move on to the next thing unless they have learned the first thingi was unable to complete the projects because the practical coding was not taught  dont throw a third of the course into the first practice i get to without first walking me through short contained examples of how to actually use the code and testing me on each piece before putting it all together	0
course did not meet my expectations i would not have paid the  for it knowing what i know now i also found the lectures to be not very helpful	0
this course is not a beginner level course rather it is an intermediate one i had to put in more than  hours a week to complete this course a basic knowledge of control theory is a must	1
all of the course material and talk is available on google documentation didnt get to learn anything otherwise zero experience talk no real scenariosexamples not worthy at all	1
very very bad session	0
this course is not as good as the ones that are part of the digital marketing specialization it was hard to keep traction and interest to finish it	1
solid and to the point it will not get you ready to do a research but it will give you the tools to design a solid enough draft or question for a research	4
quite informative and relevant content i must say	4
nicely targeted for the programmer needing a jump start into android while having a good base in java	3
nice course with very introductory information	2
ok course well tught but overall i prefer more business related classes	2
it is very good introduction course	4
directly and efficient	4
waste of time	1
great i would also particiapte in an advanced course	4
it was very informative the instructor needs to slow down just a little though i could tell hes a little nervous speaking to large groups otherwise it was great im from bawa and i am familiar with and love jhu so i support any great course coming from there	3
the course is different from expected it is more software project management than software product management	2
it is better if allow me upgrade only when i finished this course	2
this course was ultimately frustrating to take there is a gap in the material presented and the skill set needed to complete the assignments using optional methods to complete this course such as to use the textbook and forums is too time consuming deciphering a text book or insulting forum mentor responsesto to solve the assignments it usually involved trying to  refreshing yourself in math concepts not used by a beginner or nonmathematician  deciphering what exactly the poorly written questions were asking  scouring the textbook or internet for functions or strategies never covered in the lecture  having snarky and unhelpful remarks by mentorsthe unprofessional behavior of the mentors was especially hard to handle even from the early weeks lectures we learned about semantics and how simple mistyping could lead to programming errors so i wrongly assumed the mentors would understand that some of us would probably make simple errors for example in the final homework i had a simple mistake but since we cannot show code it led to more frustration and a mentor basically just saying we covered this already im well aware of what we covered but if someone is stuck on a problem there needs to be a much better way of helping that person i did not want to write in the forums after my initial foray in the forum led one mentor to just tell me your logic is wrong and the spout the same simple strategies of the lecture that could not help on the complex assignmentthere probably will not be anything fixed with this course since it seems like it has been the same for years now please fix the questions stop using project euler and let people directly message code to mentors will probably save time rather than try to blindly and frustratingly explain code over and over again ultimately i felt that unless someone either has previous experience in coding or has no work to do other than to do this course it still is not worth it to just obtain a certificate	0
terrible course compared to all others ive seen on courseracontent is scarce quality is low maybe okay for college graduates but being in business its just too slimvideo quality is also terrible dont waste 	0
fairly easy good for start	2
highly usefull overview of different technologies and minor improvements to existing systems	3
it said it could be done on your schedule but that is not true i want to withdraw from this stupid course  it sucks	0
please include exercises for computing the ratios and the valuation methods invideo questions would have helped more the quiz does not actually test the understanding of the topic indepth there can be some external readings suggested  resources that help us get more understanding on the subjects discussed	1
good course for improving working with sql in data warehouses	3
from the child hood i am interested in photo voltaic s but i didnt get the right place to know about the solar energynow my quest for the knowledge in this field is going to full fill through this coursethe dtu course team put tremendous efforts to bring forward this course to the course era communityexcellent job	4
very informative course instructor was great and very thorough i missed some way to review most important events and dates quickly	4
there are serious issues in the it infrastructure for this online course coursera needs to upgrade their it infrastructure for it to be real time you may go through the threads in help for more information and issues posted by other usersapart from this it is extremely difficult to communicate with someone in coursera regarding anything and in any form ie email live chat etc	0
love the way this course is taught	4
good overview of all the services but i could have read it just from the service list and all the labs can be done without watching this course there is no barely any information about machine learning except for a small tensorflow playground overview and copy pasting python to datalab but this negative comment is only because i was expecting it to be a bit more comprehensive for someone who has no previous information about any of the subjects this can be a good introduction	1
this is not a stepwise introduction to r for the novice useful in many respects but the uninitiated to the field need more time slow increments in project difficulty and more thorough step by step explanations i think the designers of the course wrongly assume that all r programming should be taught in this course which is erroneous it should be about laying the foundations on which the student can then expand hisher r programming abilities	1
this course was supposed to be the last one before capstone and what did we learn nothing about electronic huge amount about networking on very basic level  question is what are people without this knowledge at all doing in iot course how you can tweet from raspberry pi hey is somebody crazy here lot of words about camera few minutes about servo motor and thats allwe have to write a web server update which is completely unexplained and no one didnt do it because no one understood it that way despite the fact that webserver is webserver and server is server and during whole course no one update the task definitionthere is no discussion board it was turned off during earlier courses and for me only explanation is that no one from uci doesnt care and the certificate for course cost very pathetic approach which i can only explain with  words easy money	0
videos and readings were very clear i appreciated the fact that our professor was very knowledgable on the subject of international criminal law there were many different examples and case studies presented that helped further my knowledge of how international criminal proceedings go	4
poor fun american english intermissions thats about it	1
difficult but really useful	4
poorly structuredbloateddiscontinuous content	1
it is a very basic course to give you high level of what the course is going to cover and the tools that will be used throughout the course if you have much programming background this course will be a breeze	2
awsome and useful	4
a good course with an informative execution centred curriculum	3
this course is very useful and easy for me to follow it ill try to do some nutritive meal	3
for an undergraduate course its good  my only comment is on delivery  quotations given verbally might have been better if shown on screen to drive them homei hope the professor will do a military history course that analyzes war more particularly now that we have the broad strokes my interest is piqued from this course and i want to know more about specific warsbattles i am also interested in war prior to  esp ancient civilizations	2
review of documentation from meteorjs websiteslow and boring courselast assignment is where something starts to be moving but thats the end of course you could dive deep into subscribepublish what is below meteornodejs etc	1
very good course for basic physics if youre looking for a physic course to build the base for mechanical engineering highly recommend this one	1
great course although feeling as always a bit rushed on the last lectures at least it makes you want to investigate more about the subjecti find frustrating however not to have a proper instructor example of the final assignment it is hard to review other participants work and realize what they  you have done wrong without actually knowing how best the assignment should have been fulfilledand as all courses in this specialization there is not much interaction between participants and not much effort by mentors to animate it	3
far less staid than some of the more traditional academic teaching formats in this science field i was surprised i actually anaged to get through the introductory module but by the end of the course i was less inclined to want to attempt the end of module project simply because the instructions did not really provided sufficient indicators that guided newcomers to the subject of programming but in this science field it seems that is the norm with many introductory programming coursesmaybe the people teaching have forgotten what its like to start at the beginning and recall a time when they thought surely there is a better way in which to teach this subject that makes the connection between theory and practice and the relative interconnection much like bitesize stepping stones links a more plausible and achievable option for those unfamiliar in the field of computer science not sure why this aspect seems to fall short in cs but for some reason it doesi should imagine this course for many people who are either familiar with the fundamentals of programming andor aufait with cs concepts on the whole and have already acquired the necessary basic skill set  knowledge base of programming will find the subject and teachings rather informative and a move forward in the development of programming languages as the format in writing programs does depict a much simpler approach when compared to other languagessadly for a complete beginner to cs this in my opinion fails to sufficiently guide or assist newcomers in building the confidence to later embark on a project that draws on the subject topics taught thus far and to that end its a bit of a shame as it tends to dampen your enthusiasm if you are interested in the field of computer science as that lack of clarification on what aspects relate to what factors does not become clear so when faced with the daunting task of the end of module project you may find yourself nonplussed wondering which topic relates to which task in the final projecti am sure other people will be inclined to disagree with my opinion on this but this is after all just my opinion after giving the subject taster a try the end result for me was that the teaching methods were good as they appeared more relaxed and format was offered in a far more enjoyable way of teachinglearning a subject that i felt attempted to invoke or entice people where an interest in cs had been sparked and was perhaps aiming to offer a route in which to build the foundations of a programming language but then by the final week it was a case of well we have thrown this information your way its now up to you to decipher what you need to apply to the which part of the final project and is done so under the guise of problem solvingthe latter being a plausible concept i would find perhaps more applicable later on in the specialisation as you develop knowledgeskills but to be incorporated into the very first module of this pathway it seems doing so is what it seems like most introductory programming courses invoke and is quite a leap to embark upon especially without first being offered stepping stones sufficient enough to feel certain you have adequate understanding to be able to sift through the information provided and subsequently decide upon which aspects are relevant in order to attempt to accomplish the tasks set that ultimately form to complete the final projectits actually through being guided by the experts whose teachings highlight to newcomers through practical visual sessions where we actually begin to learn where these interconnections link between these chunks of informational topics  all of which form the essential fundamental building blocks  and in so doing that perhaps perceived initial spoon fed approach then enables a newcomer to build sufficient skills and knowledge to then be able to actually develop their confidence without the essential basic foundational mixture how is it possible to engage newcomers enough for them to determine when they will then feel equipped to attempt a final project this stepping stone approach is surely the most effective way to equip a person new to a subject field so they can then broaden their knowledge base alas in cs it seems the falling flat on your face so to speak is a preferential approach to learning in this field of studyits such a shame these highly intellectual people who create these courses forget what its like to start at the very beginning and the time it takes and guidance needed in order for a person to be able to feel like they are ready to dive in and give a topic like this a whirl like i said its only my opinion but this is where the interconnection and building of the knowledge base falls short at an early stage of development	2
good and very practical content ready to be applied	3
i enjoyed the course to review my csshtml skills and get started on javascript i would recommend this course if you have some preliminary experience if you are completely new to these materials it might be worth doing an introductory course first as this course is fastpaced and for a beginners many details might be missing	3
nice course useful to know the most common tools used to do bioinformatics	3
test questions for week  are incorrect and do not match video  reading had to go to youtube to figure out most of it	0
this is a really interesting course and the teacher is really clear with the explanations ive acquired new skills that i will apply it on my current research project i invite you to join the course	4
i think this part is greati have learned something very heuristic	4
i highly recommend this course there are some specific tips for improving your efficiency and it supported by some real life ex	4
good material with a very generalized but advanced overview of conceptssome fatigue and lack of confidence was noted in the lecturers more confidence with assured speaking will elevate the review stars	3
there	4
best but it could be little difficult for beginner	3
poorly described but versatile in coverage could do with accessing lecture notes	2
great course	4
why intro is so longit becomes boring without any physical interpretation of knowledgecant you take at least one design project or demomany things were said but very little went in head	1
definitely they can do a much better job despite therere many improvements compared to the first course however the introduction is lack of logic and i still find myself lacking of systematic command of the material towards the end of this session kind of disappointed	0
pretty boring and quite hard to follow not all subjects in the quizzes were covered in the study material provided or in the lessons	1
too sample  and i would expect more in detail	1
despite the fact that the most indemand course is free of cost prof andrew ng teaches it as best as it can be taught to beginners like me who does not know anything about machine learning altought have to know atleast basic to intermediate maths concepts the explanation of complex mathematical algorithms and concepts are made very simple and interesting i hope this turns out to be beneficial and practically useful for me as i progress thought the courseat the time of writing this review i am currently in week  successfully completed all  weeks but in  months	4
a basic intro to html well structured and easy to follow	3
this course is a great introduction to fire safety engineering it gives a clear overview about the subject i really hope there will be more courses on this topic	3
this course covers the basic knowledge of statistics and probability but skips the mathematical details behind the theory great for beginners but not perfect for advanced users	3
excellent course that i have already recommended to a couple of people only annoying thing is the continued inconsistency between the graphlab version and other versions i use sframe with python  no graphlab  some of the instructions are less than clear and needlessly waste time	3
interesting and important course so useful and rich in infothank you	3
straight forward instruction which easy to follow provide practice to get familiar with the course environment	4
this course is an excellent comprehensive introduction to stats it is challenging but in a very good way expectations are set sufficiently high that you need to grasp the concepts to succeed excellent mooc	4
the course is way to basic and easy	2
definitely a very light course designed for beginners and to promote the leidens  years international studies program in safety and security somewhat very disappointing to me useful to note the not so realistic  peerreviews awaited in that course two of  words and one of  words totally unbalanced	1
a university course should be a place where you advance your knowledge with a limited and reasonable amount of time spent in the course the role of instructors should be to invest the time to provide the concepts and information for the students of the course to learn faster than if they had to research the planet by themselves to find the knowledge the information provided by instructors therefore must be accurate and complete this course has so many incomplete pieces of information that it requires insurmountable amounts of time to find the concepts required to apply the knowledge hence it becomes a gigantic time waster unfortunate the tool and the concept of data science is necessary but a course organized this way is only for full time students that have only one obligation study this course as it is should not be in coursera	0
outstanding tips to write a scientific paper know how academia works and also how to organize your work i recommend	3
is great  	4
this course has nothing to do with excel it should be called statistic and binary modelling with little use in excel if you except to learn about functions pivot tabels macros and the many other exciting features of excel this is not the course for you	0
i really enjoyed how expert professor sachs is on sustainable development he seems to know a lot about the subject and we can see a spark on his eyes when he is teaching moreover the lectures and quizzes are comprehensive and well organizedhowever apart from the last week i think that solutions for the many problems that professor sachs presents are not showed properly although there are many issues unsolved there may be a lot of good examples throughout the world to be presented together with these issueskind regardsrodolfo	3
all the courses in this specialization are great but compared to the other  i did until now this one seemed a bit short on material especially week  and somewhat week  was without good material weeks   and  were great i got lost somewhere in week  on collapsed gibbs samplingstill very much recommend this course it provides a good introduction to nearest neighors kmeans gaussian mixtures and lda thx prof fox	3
good introduction easy to follow	3
five stars for emphasis on accessibility explanation and detail of semantic elementsthree stars for course content testing prior to publication and for omission of linux i use sftp on a commandline interface and did not learn in this course how to use mput for putting multiple html files and web assets onto my live site there is no hyphen in metadata nor are there two hyphens in local area network	3
not very helpful in the homework i spent more time wrestling with commands in r than actually gaining an understanding of the subject matteralso i really didnt need so many subject matter examples about the professors babys pooping habits and my family is dutch with all the offensive humor that comes with it so its not just a matter of the sense of humor not translatingim retaking statistics with calculus online at my local state university and frankly i cant notice any benefit from taking this course first my current online statistics with calculus course is rewarding and i feel like im truly gaining mastery of the topics whereas in the basic statistics course i was flounderingthe graphics in the way the lessons are presented are well done but i would have been just fine with fewer graphics if it meant more workedthrough examples	1
i took all  previous courses in this series and they were all greatbut suddenly coursera has changed its policy and one can not take courses for free anymoreif you just want to learn and gain knowledge without chasing the certificate than the course is useless because you cant receive feedback for your work	0
this is very basic and fundamental	3
extremely boring and not	0
this course is amazing	4
very nice course with lots of insights about survey data collection and the issues related with getting right data for right inferences	4
i soon got bored with the simplistic solutions lack of challenge and frankly a condescending attitude i then took all the quizzes guessed or surmised the answers got  right and went on to something more productive	0
i really appreciate the attempt of the course what i got is that we should trust good research and that claims need to be proved the problem though was the approach in my opinion i felt that someone was giving me the right answer for everything and i wasnt supposed to think about it alli would rather focus my attention on the large gap between reality and scientific claims the power of a costbenefit analysis is enormous and it could be even broader with a personal interpretation and with a high level of awarenesswell done with the aim of the course just develop the approach impactps the part with the guy that is apparently in asia is really chaotic and i couldnt follow that amount of short videos	2
the course was very simplistic and more targeted to a new manager or a student who has never taken a conflict resolution course i only found the interviews with karen and joseph to be of interest the instructors teaching style is too monotone  i didnt get a sense of her real world experience coming through no sense of her brand	2
good course material and wonderful instructor was able to learn a lot	4
this course is garbage the instruction videos are fine but the assignments are imprecise in their language at times and there are certain key points needed to complete them that arent covered in the videos the mentor in the forums is lousy and his responses are worded as if hes talking with a peer and not a beginnerstudenti may or may not try another coursera course after this but if this experience is any indication coursera isnt very good the same uofm course appears over on udemy and i wonder if it is just being repurposed on as many platforms as possible without the care needed to make sure it works	0
the lectures for this course lacked substance the quizzes predominantly asked for verbatim recitation of the substancefree lectures	1
simple excellent clear what we all need to know 	4
nice syllabus overall with great exerciseswish it would teach more commonly used excel skills in business eg pivot tables indexmatch vlookup etclectures were a bit hard to follow esp the mathy ones  id suggest reworking the blackboard craft	2
irrationally difficult and inexplicably sloppy having taken first business metrics for data driven companies i had high hopes that it would be on the same levelwell i was wrong it was extremely messy jumping around from definition to definition with little to no explanation and there was a general lack of motivation from professor eggers partapart from week  that had some necessary basic knowledge of excel all of the next weeks lessons were fast paced beyond a beginners comprehension by week  i had lost the motivation to go on and was only able to finish it through a great deal of trial and error on the quizzesi would not recommend it unless you have some basic knowledge of the economic theories used in this lesson	0
good course coming from a traditional art historical contextcontent which is still a very valuable methodology in this age of visual culture thank you	3
it is not any technical lab based exercise bases i mean	2
very useful to help you in understanding how financial markets work  and how they react to number of variables especially economic and monetary variables	4
chaotic organization unclear instructions and confusing due dates i would not recommend such specialization	1
many mcq in the quiz were out of the course we studied	3
a recommended knowledge for learners enjoyed it a lot thank you	4
a lot of time devoted to the job stuff may not be super relevant for most students and was certainly not super relvant too	2
boring most of them are history dont worth it   week into the course very boring not technical enough the test basically asked people to remember things that are not useful 	0
two stars because i really suffered during this course i didnt like the instructor behavior of explaining the topics he representsfirst of all i didnt like the idea of building over one website if you didnt get what was happening so you already ruined a part of the total website which you will continue building over during the whole coursesecond the assignments requirements requires additional searches which wasnt explained in details during the sessionthird the explanation is so boring and you can easily lose your concentration because of poor communication skillsforth the assignments requires two many details really also i need to get the code of other classmates using get source code  option on my google chrome and then run it again  there are much efficient ways to handle that like running the delivered assignment directly on the server	1
it appears the teacher doesnt take the necessary steps to polish content and tests everything feels unstructured and adlib course videos dont seem to follow any kind of logic or purpose and tests are based on highly subjective content but are not prepared to deal with the subjectivity of reviewers ie forcing them to provide feedback instead of giving points arbitrarily	1
the content might be great but the teachers dont seem to enjoy presenting the course at all they are basically reading from a script very monotonous atmosphere	1
this course was designed near to perfection  dr barbara oakley and dr sejnowski did a wonderful jobi liked the optional interviews a lot and learned from the insights of special achievers in their fieldi liked the idea of writing essays on our plan of using this knowledge for our own and for teaching others what we have learned  fascinating and rewarding	4
great class easy to follow and very informative	4
actually i want rate  as the instruction for the installation of new tools are quite vague and misleading	0
this is probably the most pedagogically inept course i have ever enrolled on although the content is what you would hope to find in such a course the delivery of it is outrageously bad when to complete your assignment google becomes your best friend rather than your lecture notes you know that something is wrong the idea that a baby thrown in the water may just learn to swim rather than drown is pedagogically retarded unfortunately this seems to be the approach here	0
the materials are very useful and exciting i have learned the necessary skills and processes to learn professionally	4
went in a slow pace enjoyed the modules especially final assignment	2
good course for beginners	4
tedious introduction delayed second week hope that the following section will be better	2
so much of the content was limited without paying for the course that calling it a mooc is a real stretch because of these limitations most of my work was done on my own and by purchasing the related book since my local community college used to run this course but now points to this onine course instead its a huge disappointment most folks who are going into business for themselves need good information but have little cash the one star is for the handouts i believe pulled from other websites but pointed to by this course  these have been useful	0
too much emphasis on taking tests versus actually programming	0
lectures have very poor teaching skills	0
i think these courses need to be condensed into a single one as the contents are rather limited individually	2
excellent insight into how we become addicts encourages further research	4
very hard to comprehend for  weeks but could have been great	2
very bad course the content can barely be applied outside us you dont know from which perspective its explained for sales or purchasing people the videos are bad quality the teacher is babbling no extra resources no interaction with the audience outside the assessments	0
an interesting class that traces the origins of buddhist meditation and the western usage today a nice dovetailing of research topics covered to attempt to link measurable changes due to meditation practices while trying to maintain a good control group not easy	2
really awesome course for the beginners in ml	4
i took this a year ago and i still use the strategies i loved it	3
easy to follow yet advanced techniques simplified by great software	4
much trouble with freezing and no sound	1
this course is clickbait for the purpose of soliciting information about the private life of participants it barely contains any facts and it contains in total zero references to studies that facts are taken from this shouldnt be on coursera and an organization making a course like this shouldnt be allowed to call itself a university	0
extremely highlevel quality of the material is significantly lower than in the previous courses	1
contents are interesting and useful even if the course deals with few topics i think it is too expensive a good grammar book is cheaper and more completei would not enroll this course anymore	1
i really delight in doing this courses i think they are amazing for new teachers but also a very good refreshment of good practices best practices for experienced teachers	4
the big assignment at the end contains instructions that are outdated and incomplete given the length of the course it feels like you already need to know the material before even taking it	0
where is the material there is nothing under any of the weeks lectures	0
the material in this course is very interesting i feel comfortable with the concepts and algorithms i am definitely prepared to utilize these skills in an entrylevel manner  it will take some handson practice with real datasets to build expertise understand the nuances of these approaches and expand my knowledge base i recommend a decent level of comfort with programming i completed the python for everybody specialization but still struggled with the programming in this course	3
the deep learning part needs to be improved	2
the professor just read the materials through all the modules and the course was really boring but the content was quite updated that was the only good thing does not worth such a high payment	1
ill start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of d printing there are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways the last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinkingthe reason that ive only rated  stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework i think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation i do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course	2
very bad explanations you dont understand anything about what youre doing just pressing buttons this should maybe go after the command line course so that at least you would have any idea of what youre doing	0
informative and interesting	3
kinda too slow in speed but overall great	2
lectures are clear and extensively cited assignments are interesting	3
the student needed to have a good foundation of statistics and high levels of math to be able to follow the class i have not taken statistics or trigonometry in many years so i struggled i would have benefited greatly if there were more examples of how to calculate the models including the calculations part of it the professor did not do that and that got me wondering not knowing how to calculate the formulas i think if i had seen a few examples it would have been enough to understand and keep upso more stepbystep instructions on the mechanics of formulas would be my biggest recommendationbut the professor did a superb job explaining the concepts and showcasing some industry applications of the modelsthank you for asking	1
the subject is interesting and the instructors both seemed very competentstill i wish the course had been better prepared as there were lots of sounds defects you had to adjust the volume during each video which is tiresome in the same idea the questions during the course would pop up in midsentence sometimes with too much anticipation with the subject at hand last the questions in the assignments were sometimes not so much to check your understanding but your memory about a small detail like a  in a study that is already obsolete by the time we learn itall in all a great course with great instructors but still room for improvement as a mooc	2
i like the material of the course the interviews but i think it is pretty strict with the answers the ask for in some of the first assessments	2
completely missed the explanation part of the teaching why use n for standard deviation because of degrees of freedom only mention no further explanation just no explanations of anything in this course i looked at the biostats course by the same guy same story teaching is more than just saying the facts you have to explain things lead the understanding the materials are just not there not in the book either	1
great course the instructors could have gone a bit slow during the session on multiple regression	3
the information was quite was good but the practice and assignments were too easy thanks for providing full explanations and a set of invideo examples for every rule	2
the topic is really good but the course does not cover the tools or methodology detailed enough it is too high level and not many examples or assignments	1
too short and simple	2
great course even better command on the topic by instructor lincoln pratson  learned a lot thanks	4
videos were ok practice quizzes somewhat helpful however the final autograder quiz was extremely temperamental and gave no usable feedback this resulted in frustration and made what should have been a good experience a very bad oneupdated course to three stars since a change was made to be able to pass the final quiz without needing to pass the autograder submission	2
learnt a lot  really interesting and informative	3
very practical chucks is the best at explaining things very simple useful and hands on	4
this course offers a good general overview on the essentials of entrepreneurship	3
mostly fluff with little substance the videos seemed loosely tied around a common subject but it might as well have been a youtube playlist on overall concepts of cities needing to be aware of climate change the week  videos were the same as the week  with very vague statements about cities needing to experiment with sustainability to approach the challenges of the st century only the week  video on copenhagen was actually educational beyond the most superficial concepts	0
i liked the course very much but it is brief i think it will help us more if some topics are explained in detail	2
quizzes are not challenging enough	2
it was overall alright all of the group assignments killed it for me though	2
i admitted in this course  and i completed it i would like to say that this course is the great course to improve our english skills even more this course is the best way to start studying business for whom interested on business	4
content is not excellent the trainer is just reading a text while slides are passing trough the screen no examples no analogies no explanation whatsoever i wouldnt call that a training im quite disappointed	1
not really clear step up from the scratch to androidjava programming	2
repetitive long too academic unnecessary terms the instructor voice is annoying after  minutes blah	1
great	4
a very good course for people who does not have knowledge of finances i highly recommend this course it would be better if the course had more practice exercises	3
objective and professional evaluationif i could give this course a zero i would have done so but it is not possible i shall explain my reasons below the teaching method of this course is very lackadaisical and lackluster the ratios are introduced and solved without having a pl statement or a balance sheet on the side to see how the figures are extracted and implemented which made it more boring its final part quiz lacks the proper instructions and the redundant instructions already there do not help either for example it says part  is answering npv however part  includes six calculation questions unrelated to the project to be submitted in parts  and  the forms of putting an answer are unclear although it mentions how to put a percentage and two decimal points peer assessment take ages and is unnecessary discussion forums are deserted islands where no professional staff interaction is givenive stopped continuing this specialization and i strongly recommend others not to waste their time on it	0
this course has improved my writing and my understanding to different types of sentences my punctuating skills has been improved too	4
horrible the tests make very little sense use elements not described in the course and is generally very confusing	0
really helpful course	4
thank you good course	4
learning wise  a good course certificates for individual courses of the series would have been good	3
great start many promises but week  and  go in a wrong direction instead of speaking about strategy  author goes into unrelated fields trash bins as a reference of a new strategical approach  misses a point that it is not a mass product what strategical decisions did it involve that were not related to marketing almost none strategy is much much wider term regarding new tendencies globalization has happened yesterday today its time to open new horizons in relation to application of it solutions to management problems after alphago proved that a computer program is more skillful in a complex game of go than one of the top human players  it will not take much to the next step  strategical decision making on a corporate level what companies need to do today infrastructure  probably new organizational structure  definitely	1
great introduction  analysis of concepts	2
the best course of this segment	4
i would have expected more in terms of the depth of content beyond ohio but still it is very interesting and complete a must do for anyone looking to build a startup ecosystem	3
very resourceful course highly recommend it to anyone who thinks learning can be a difficult task	4
for a starter very complex overview	4
the course is easy but informative	3
do you wanna know about modern and efective edication take this course	4
full individuals speaking	2
not exciting instructor too stiff and looked like reading a paper	0
i didnt like this course i found it to be confusing compared to other css js html courses such as the one from michigan or hong kong universities which are quite clear and crispt and refreshing this seems like a work in progress confusing convoluted oddhtml css js are actually not very difficultthis course makes u question your own name makes you think basic math is calculus it needs work lots and lots of work i cant recommend it to anyone who is serious about learning js html or css it accomplishes the exact oppositewith regards to that chinese restaurant field trip what the hell man is this a joke have the lady call  web  com and have a cookie cutter just add water web site this segment is sillythe rest of the segments confusing	0
primitive and useless	0
i should have never paid for this course by the time i got into the subject the refund policy was expired do not take pay for this course or program at all	0
it was too bad to not permit the students to perform the quizzes only if we pay for them i thought the payment was for the certificate	0
for the eager student maybe some more resources should have been shared i was hoping to learn some production quality environment basics eg the ideal editor best practices etcthat said i really liked how the  components css js and html were stitched together to help understand interactive webpages using js	2
the course content is great however basic knowledge of python programming language is required since i didnt know python coding rules i really struggled for a while maybe basics of python in additional resources will help a lot of learners	3
great material taught in an easy way thanks	4
the instructor looks nerves when he talking	0
one of the most useful courses that i have taken it will help you to tackle those difficult subjects at college it will also help you to excel in the different aspects of you livereally helpfultake it you wont regret it	4
not very helpful for those with a solid statistical background i prefer to use r to do the modeling things while this course should talk more about pivot tables and existing useful financial functions which advantage over other statistical tools	0
way too shallow and way too english 	1
excellent detailed course although us content it is relevant since much development is done in the usa	4
content was generally well covered one improvement could have been slightly better examples of how there are multiple different ways to solve the same problems the instructor would often allude to this but would just advise the student to read through the pandas docs which could be nonintuitive at times	3
really helpful full of things that could seem obviously after the course but not before thanks	4
while this course seems to have potential there are many aspects of it that dont result in a great learning experience the course resources comprise of videos and notes the videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking perhaps the biggest issue that i found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources as a result confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning a topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and i wouldnt expect a short course on coursera to be able to adequately cover it however i do think that a lot more could be done to improve the value of this course even if that means changing the scope of the materials also the lack of responsiveness to issues raised on the forum and issuereporting buttons was a disappointment	1
i think the course offered some wonderful advice but more examples could have been given the guest lecture interviews were incredible	3
did not go into enough detail reiterated home cooking and spoil rate but did not get into specifics perhaps another class on what foods do what in your body would be beneficial	1
its simply easy and goodbut may be to basic	3
interesting content but the bad english grammar makes it hard to get through and sometimes simply incomprehensible i dropped the course after the second week because of this	1
simple concepts but it got me out of a rut and has improved my productivity	3
i learned not only the theory of many machine learning algorithm but the good scientific efficient way to implement it to my application that is really i wanted by the way the course is moderate difficulty and the program exam can help you master the course	4
very interesting course i am learning a lot	4
at later stages also  examples should be used for explanation 	2
the professors are erudite and give amazing lecture they explain the hard subject in an easytounderstand waybesides they cover more knowledge in a limited time	4
the videos were not very professionaldepth of the subject was not therevery introductory and generic course where personal branding as a subject was merely cursorily touched	1
lots of good information but the presentation is very bad not only are the professors clearly struggling with the english and the material calling anatomical planes plates and confounding sulci with fissures etc but some of the recordingvideo editing decisions make it less engaging and more difficult to follow for example the size of the images is often compromised because they chose to show the professor on the left side of the screen even though it is absolutely unnecessary to do sooverall i do not recommend this course	0
this was a very professionally done course it is very introductory which is either good or bad depending on how you feel about it	3
the course is really nicely done also for nonamericans it is interesting even though a lot of background knowledge might be missing but you have to be aware it is really more focused on the ideas of jefferson and less on all the discussions and fights he had with his fellow statesmen at that time i would have wished to learn also more about those	3
good contents but lectures could be improved for clarity	2
in general it was an interesting and thoughtprovoking course the only minus was that we werent able to download a pdf version of a book to which the professor kept referring recommend for anyone who wants to get to know the basics of economy	3
i havent been able to use c  in my pc so the course became useless	0
useful for basics only	2
i learned some things that i didnt know from this class compared to other classes that i have taken on coursera it has rather low production values	1
not enough material to understand the concepts	0
i cant give more for this course 	1
minus  stars for  complaints infographics for journalism might be a better title the grading guidelines for the project see all specific to one type of publishing grades assigned by fellow classmates are very subjective and sometimes miss the points made it the material some of the class material is posted on youtube and has advertising i didnt buy into the class so i could watch ads	1
very basic content not that helpful  states what to pay attention to but scarcely how to also is very static uses very little illustrations  animations  visuals which is a shame for a photography course	2
thank you very much 	3
this course did not motivate me at all videos where mainly repetitive and the questions seemed to be there to serve no purpose	0
i really like the company narratives for this very overview presentation it would be helpful to see more of these	3
need to update assignments	2
so many maths  hardcore foundations it hurts	4
very enjoyable lectures very well put together materials extremely helpful exercises thank you	4
its ok for an extremely highlevel overiew	2
good organization and lecture format but stressfully strict rubrics on the assignments given the peer review structure	2
the course is outdated and abandoned by the teachersswiftkey engineers are nowhere to be seenthere is no guidance	1
excellent thoughts and concepts presented	4
excellent gives deep understanding of main data structures and its usage	4
a great course with a very good overview on the international courts and tribunals of the hague and is very helpful to the better understanding of internationals tribunals specially for law students in their first years	3
 stars its more great course would advise this to anyone thank you for the experence	4
a wortlhy course	4
exciting it is clear and informative	4
i feel i just learn the superficial knowlege	2
i really enjoyed the presenter who was engaging and interesting i didnt enjoy the podcasts	2
its clear and offers a very good foundation supplementary material is helpful however in my view the course needs more practical illustrations of how some of the different strategy definition and approaches are practised or not today by modernday companies some of the material was too abstract and was somewhat difficult to relate to	2
introductory level coursenothing much on analytical methods	2
i found it to be a very useful class on important topics in web analytics the homework assignments are not very difficult and encourage learning instead of gradeseeking plus dr chuck is an engaging instructorps i gave it  starts because the assignments were a bit too easy at times my feedback is to include advanced but optional assignments in future sessions	3
i like this course	4
hard to follow with a lot of technical intructions right off the bat with inadequate explanation a lot of read more about this at insert url videos were boring and the instructor was invisible just reading off the slides not very engaging	1
nothing but following the lectures hardly any quizes or assignments where you have to work things out on your own also theres way too much material crammed into four weeks leading to a lack of depth i learned a lot but this was not very engaging	1
i thought it was an excellent class for discovering how our memory works thanks to the movie examples it provided great insights into our brains and importantly the professor was there to explain the differences between fiction and actual scientific knowledge 	3
good content but blocked quizes in free version is bad idea	1
great course	3
very good introductory course its a lot of material to cover for a newbie but if you have some background you will find you progress pretty quickly enjoyable engaging fun and useful	4
the teacher seems to mainly read the slides and the tone is quite scholastic not a lot or engagement indeed the course gives some info on the social background of doping on how it is fought and it is adopted worth it if you have a strong interest in sports	2
well explanation and very informative notes for better understanding the real problems	3
i think the best part of this course is its diversity the course is so well structured that theories of several important school of economics are discussed with their applications in the history	3
great coursevery well organized and worked in a format where you would build as you learned and had several milestones for reviewthe one complaint i have is that the final asks for you to work in tableau and provides you a license for  days although the course runs longer than that	2
completing this course was a great learning on understanding iot platform the course sessions provided by trainers and documentation were very useful to complete the assignmentsdiscussions column to work with trainers directly improved my confidence on completing the assignments on timecollecting of data is useful only when analyzedregardsmohan	4
boring	0
dr chuck is great as usualand some probles with autograder service	3
good course to get you thinking about python	3
the course enlightens from within and motivates to teach in right direction	3
the videos were very tedious and convoluted in addition to being outdated almost all of the methods were deprecated by the time i was taking this course i wouldnt recommend this course at all	0
study material does not cover tested material appropriately for those quizzes i took i ended up doing them by trial and error took one of them seven times just changing answers quiz  is so ambiguous that i am giving up	0
a very enthusiastic teacher but the information was difficult to follow and some of the assessments took over  hours to complete this made it hard to get the work done	1
all in all the material videos and assignments were very interesting and they made up an exciting coursehowever some of the slides lacked sufficient information on notions or did not make references to supplementary sources the assignment material mainly pdfs sometimes had typos which made solving them a bit confusing and more time consuming without actually being very difficult also for both slides and assignments the notations were not always consistent andor variables disappeared from equations without clear explanationsi hope in the next offering of this course there will be improvements on these aspects	2
it should definitely have more quizzes at least one per week	3
great course looking forward to start other courses from whole specialization fantastic work	4
ok it was a rerun and there wasnt much help in the forum and there were too few exercises but it was really interesting	2
besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues the way of teaching is well adapted to onsite classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google or stackoverflow or whatever  really somehow it seems they just took an onsite course played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a mooc they seem not really aware of the fact that onsite teaching and moocs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best mooc dr chucks and one of the worst this one	0
the course was very basic i dont think i have learned anything new	1
quite disappointing lecturers  tutors no responding in time and the solution provided are questionable which already happened in earlier courses of this specialisation	1
not interestingto many examples about russian emitents	0
i continue to like the way the prof brooks explains the different topics the selection of the topics themselves and the scientific articles are very enriching i was previously an hci researcher and it was a pleasant surprise to find such great art thanks for sharing them it was defenetly a challenge for me learning it all and doing the assignments at the end im proud ive learned a lot and lll definitely share what ive learn so far thank you	4
interesting and perspective course	3
the professor does not evaluate your assignments your classmates do giving you sometimes unfair qualifications i wont continue with the rest of the course because of that i think university of washington or coursera should have said this at the description of the course so people can decide better if take it or not	2
the instructor voice are so calm  so i cannot concentrate well	0
it would be nice to add characters to videos	3
really wanted to take this class unfortunately i believe it is more about advanced statistics then excel it was advertised as a beginners class and that is not the case i recommend having a significant knowledge of statistics before taking this course im a  year senior level accounting executive and i was easily spending  to  hours a week plus watching the videos  or  times each in order to understand the content it was very difficult to understand disappointing	0
this is great i lament can not take advantage completely of the course	4
lectures are careless prepared its really hard to follow this course without previous background in ios development despite its called introduction to swift programming there are a lot of small misleadings notes in course materials hope the next course in specialization ios app development with swift would be much better	1

the last week has materials that nothing related to assignment and it jumps a bit fast where i have no clue at all	2
the course is great it is very useful for me as a teacherthank you so mucholga	4
good course for someone wanting an overview of techniques you would not be building something very cool after this course assignments are not very challenging some good questions must be includedsome mathematical part should be there expecting it in other courses in specialization	3
i do not feel that this course is ready for publication and is overlong for the material presented	1
the courses are short and to the poit no unnecessary talk to make the videos just longer the transfered knowledge is always the essential of the topic to be discussed all the surroundings how to plot best how to structure the test eviorenment etc are taken care of in the exercisefiles i can highly recommendthis course to everyone interested in machiene learning	4
this course is very basic provides a lot of information thats not really practical or useful i suppose someone whos seeing internet for the first time would find it informative but not very engaging as for the majority of those who use coursera to selfeducate it would probably seem a bit too much of stating the obvious also id like to mention the delivery of the information  its a text thats read aloud nothing more  well thanks for that i can read faster than i can listen to a video if youre making a video  make it worth actually watching	0
i definitely learned a few new things with this course but was hoping to learn some cutting edge tips on how to differentiate yourself as an artist with modern technology and how to build your fanbase online it would be great to have tips on what to do on a daytoday basis as an artist in the digital age i also wish that the course covered more on how to avoid being shelved by a label or management company	2
not much content	1
need a discussion forum	3
way too many weekly lectures way too many in addition to that lots of the lectures were too long and sometimes even meaningless it was impossible to follow through	0
very poorly designed course material everything has been split up	1
as a business management student with a strong interest in this matter i found the course really useful for those who are rather begginers in this subject	4
cyber security is hardly covered in course iot as well is supporting product marketing coursera s losing its quality	1
good course	2
this is purely subjective but i could not keep myself awake and sustain interest long enough to finish the one section i paid for i guess i should have tried one for free firsti tried to tell the coursera staff to remove the course from my list and that i did not need my refund but sadly it sits on my enrolled courses list perhaps permanently until i cancel my account luckily i did figure out how to turn off the almost twice daily notifications	0
its a solid java class that has almost  android learning if you are expecting any kind of android related learning you will get none this is  a java class that just runs in the android environment	2
very poor teaching	1
i would not recommend this course because the video lessons are quite poor the teacher mostly reads notes from his ipad without a proper presentation or some kind of text	0
excellent course highly recommended for anyone interested in machine learning professor ng is clear and articulate and presents the content in an interesting and engaging manner	4
a bit difficult in terms or using very complicated words	1
this course could work better as either a longer course with more examples exercises and step by step instructions in excel or as a smaller part of the first and third courses in the specialization the content is good and the examples are properly explained but it probably doesnt warrant an entire course of its own	2
this is a complete intro guitar course every detail is showed theres no excuses and only one direction learn	4
passionate speaker and truly amazing things to learn about dogs	4
dr charles is very enthusiastic and fun teacherhis comparison to lifes examples makes it so much easier to learndefinitely a good beginner session to python	4
content is good but honours assignments are unclear and no help from mentors in the discussion forums  more timeconsuming than they should be	2
this is a tough course tough because i had no experience in c or c my background is dotnet and visual basic its been study c  hours a day and take the course  hours a day i made it the professor is spot on when he says a c background is needed but i made itif you have the required background youll find its a good basis for understanding the multiple vulnerabilities in this code what they are and how they work you better understand stacks and heaps and pointers real wellworth the time and the effort cheers to university if maryland for making it available and to professor hicks for his hard work	3
this is a very old fashion way of looking at development and developers where developers are considered resources and minions that need to follow orders modern development techniques value developers and allow them to be much more active players product manager is not a manager but a facilitator this course describes the view that developers are loose canons that need to be managed and that upfront planning and estimation are the right path i do not agree at all with this viewshould you happen to agree with this view the course is well explained and presented well	0
the capstone project had nothing to do with the previous three courses	1
very basic content the content in this week course accounts for similar volume as only one week in courses from other universities	1
excellent course i am a total novice in the topic but dr fredrickson is a master on sharing her wide knowledge and expertisse on positive psychology i would recommend it for sure	4
very basic and only scratching the surface of a much larger topic	0
while some of the information presented was interesting it seemed oddly biased towards the perspective of highly educated foreigners i had hoped to get more information about how america is seen by the foreign masses	1
it was pretty good but most of the information is rehashed briefly in the intro to r programming	2
very useful information about bitcoin and blockchain in general	3
assignments werent challenging	3
i hope to learn more how you wrote the code in class	0
the instructor is amazing	4
not really well produced for the media too much instruction of the teacher few practice instead	0
the course looks a lot like advertisement of a textbook i dont have anything against ads but ads are not very suitable for teaching	1
great explanation	4
interesting but could be improved with further applications	2
homework was poorly structured and not adequately discussed in the lecture videos had to dig through several buried links to make any progress on the homework assignments	0
easy to follow very clear plots the course content is very flexible both good for beginners to understand and give extra space for the proficient to improve skills	4
i found this course helpful and gave me basic ideas to brainstorm on a project which at the initial phase on finding out the right opportunity	3
another batch of interesting topics but this time the labs are  imperfect there are are errors in the scripts not difficult to troubleshoot and fix but still please review and correct them	4
great very useful course many thanks for this opportunity	4
i feel i have really solidified my understanding of java basics for the purposes of learning the android development platform	4
great course although very basic	3
interesting to know about data scientist and the tools eagerly waiting to go through the next lesson	3
way too basic probably only suitable for absolute beginners	1
the content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology but it is somewhat if not totally a false representation of interaction with the experts there is absolutely none	2
to be honest i like the subject but found the course material and content not very well structured i missed more mathematical foundation	2
very organized course and ppt demonstration it would be great if there are more reference links for furtherdeep understanding	4
great insight into solar cells especially in regards to polymer and organic solar cells the video lectures were clear and easily understood	4
the concepts are very good but very theoreticalmore quantitative analysis should be added to prepare students to deal with the real world problems	2
useful very interesting course	3
quizzes and assignments cannot be submitted if course is audited	0
it is ironic that a course about virtual instruction is one of the worst online courses i have taken the content was good if a little outdated hence the two stars vs only one but the course design and delivery were lackingthe videos were excruciating for visual learners or really any nonauditory learners the video for week  lesson  for example had a single static image on the screen for eleven minutes words were added to the image during that time but all in all there were  words of text on the slide really eleven minutes  words give me a transcript or make it an audio file dont keep me chained to my laptop watching a static image for eleven minutesthe instructor droned and was clearly reading from a script she did not even use the video to highlight key terms or spotlight key references whenever she mentioned a reference i wanted to look at i had to either hope it was on the course reference page many of them werent there or try to figure out how to spell the authors name based on her pronunciation of it it was just really really hard to get throughthe tests were also poorly designed what states do x y or z who cares i dont live in those states which online school has this policy again who cares maybe a question about why statesschools have different approaches or how outcomes differ between statesschools but memorizing a laundry list of which state or school has which policies and practices is useless and did not advance the learning objectives in any way	1
this course is very interesting and educational i really enjoyed it my only complaint is that sometimes there wasnt any translation from spanish	3
i thought it was going to be good did the first week videos and lectures but i feel cheated because it will not let me take the quiz to move on without paying for the course no where did i ever see anything that said ahead you had to pay  if you didnt want a certificate or to do the whole specialization coursera used to be a platform i used and recommended no more	0
italian accent is way too strong	0
great review of concepts to refresh lean and six sigma and process improvement in generalexpected deeper and more practical information case studies maybe a project in a module instead of a quiz etc regarding the service industry as stated at the beginning of the course there just one part of a module aprox  min that got into some detailalso there was no interaction at all in the forums if at least the mentors could set some interesting subjects and comments to motivate that would be of helpdue to this my expectations werent met was looking for detailed service industry financial applications of process improvement knowledge	1
this course is good only to give an overview of supply chain logistics but it does not give little deep to in depth knowledge	2
i wished the content and the tests were more challenge	2
poor performance of jupyter and the wildly underestimated time commitments really sunk this one for me the latter especially is inexcusable the syllabus is lopsided and while organized not enough thought has been given to the exercise workload	1
the course is a shallow introduction to a set of topics about embedded systems it tries to cover too much without really explaining the concepts the videos could have some diagram	1
it was too advanced for me	0
interesting course to brush up already acquired knowledge in excel and add up more skills	4
i have learned so many important and interesting things and i am only getting to the third week i am very happy i enrolled here 	4
good one	4
very helpful	3
great course although i did struggle through the very last assignment the first three were relatively ok considering im new at this but they did take me longer than  hours to complete the last one took about  daysthat being said if the rspec tests werent being run in dev mode it might have been quicker i had to move envrails_env  test from rails_helperrb to spec_helperrb to get stuff workingwithout my ruby on rails hubby id have been lost	2
the programming exercises were too structured and the course was quite easy	3
this course is very interesting and useful im glad with the knowledge	4
very good course if you want to learn machin learning	4
unfortunately without a doubt the worst und most uninformative course ive ever taken apart from stating the obvious nothing new a lot of repetition of useless information super disappointed cant believe that such a course is offered here and that i really paid for nothing of such quality	0
good frameworks that make a foundation this course makes me realize selling is a critical skill and craig has done a great job at demystifying it however a lot of it is writing your own tool kits assuming you already have successful sales experience but thats what i realize i lack and that motivates me to take the course from the first place if i had the right sales approach then i would have been super successful already therefore i would like to see more real examples that delve into the complexities of realworld selling situations also craig has an awesome personality super high energy very eager to engage this makes me wonder the extent to which ones personality determines the effectiveness of the selling process i for one am more of an introvert so this begs the question if the introverts will need to do something differently to be as effective as the extroverts such as craig so i encourage showcasing different approaches from already experienced salespeople from a wide range of personalities in sum i encourage the faculty to take this course to the next level by incorporating situational cases and how sales people of a wide range of personalities have handled difficult sales situations successfully andor how someone else have handled them unsuccessfully	2
the class itself is quite good however you can not submit the module quiz without purchasing the certificate which is quite annoying	1
i definitely learned some new things during the course some of the explanations were a bit concise for someone with limited experience wth improvisation that is understandable given the length and cost of this course i would recommend it to others to gain some new knowledge and get a feel for taking online courses from berklee via coursera	3
i believe this course suffers from neglect rarely did i see any of the mentors participating in the group discussions even though there were plenty of questions furthermore some of the quiz questons seemed incomplete or confusing the project was no better i feel like the course was recorded a few years ago and not much done after that to fix flaws even though they are probably well known the material is useful but it would be nice to have a set of notes or a text to go with the lectures you will spend a lot of time searching the internet to compelte the assignments sometimes that is good but other times a guide geared to the course would have been better	1
great course	4
its really cool course for beginnersmy little advice why lectors dont use the possibilities of sublime sometimes it is so tired to see what the lector go by long way check this out please httpsublimetextunofficialdocumentationreadthedocsorgenlatestreferencekeyboard_shortcuts_winhtml	3
this class was not useful for me the professor talked about the idea of data analysis without ever discussing how to actually perform data analysis	0
structured course	3
great course however it is a little too basic for mei think it best fits for someone new	3
for me who has applied as a fee waiver its absolutely awesome that i am getting unlimited resources for learning	4
very good there is room for improvement congratulations	3
the course is thorough and wellexplained but the tests questions and answers are absurdly badlydesigned so they become very difficult	2
a really helpful course for getting to know about the concepts and use of iot	4
material for the course is outdated	0
as a non programer or mathematician this course is too hard to follow	1
a bit american  but i like it	2
i found this course very useful being a student of geology this course will help me improve my knowledge of geology	4
i did this course as a parent of a dyslexic child i thought it was brilliant and i made pages and pages of notes it is well organised engaging and informative i really liked the two presenters as well they both seemed passionate about the topic and modeled good teaching in their explanations and advice that said i thought the assessment part of the course simply didnt work it was far too narrow for anyone besides primary teachers and therefore excluded those who might be doing the course for other reasons it doesnt matter to me i dont need the certificate and i got a lot out of the course but for others it would be frustrating i imagine the quizzes too for the most part were a disaster they were poorly written confusing and dishearteningly obscure otherwise i loved this course and hope you will offer a follow up soon	3
wonderful course for beginners in ml	4
this was truly a challenging course if youre unfamiliar with scriptsin addition the course moves at a moderately fast pace but assignments are doable do the r swirl assignments	3
very good introduction and advanced insight in the field at the same time a performance to get to the essential without getting entangled with the maths while you will need at least a little understanding of algebra	4
ancient greeks is brief overview of greek civilization from about  to  bc starting with the minoans of crete and ending with the death of alexander the great prof andrew szegedymaszak demonstrates great knowledge about the subjects covering literature government and philosophyyet the course has two setbacks  the professor stutters through the lectures displaying his obvious discomfort being on camera and  the overview is very expansive so there isnt great study in any single theater of greek civilizationthere is however solid coverage i also felt the chapter on the th cent bc done to address complaints about no coverage of alexander and macedon feels tacked on its a long but somehow hurried lecturethat said i liked this course i gained greater knowledge of important political and literary figures such as solon and alcibiades than i did when i studied the subject back in college	2
i always thought that the photos are in focus right eral perfectamenet without anything that movedtoday that capture the motion with my camar is an artistic way of expressing my vision	4
i would like to have more example it feels there is mostly theory the quizzes were super easy i dropped out at final project i couldnt get through the first questions the course and especially the final project requires a good basis in statistics beforehandthe assistants are super helpful and patient	2
great subjects and some great teachers but every now and then i missed some proper explanationsfurther reverences to articles and books to better understand the subjects were missing as well	2
start point for learning ml take this class right now 	4
i think the course is really missing some key parts	0
a very good way of transitioning into scala and functional programming language concepts were explained really well	4
great introductory class	3
interesting content but sooo slow  minutes long videos could have been done in  minutes moreover the teachers voice and tone did nothing to make the content live	1
its very focus on primary teaching which is good but maybe there is a bit too much of theory i was expecting a bit more of practical resources about how to face a classroom good course anyway	2
the course is a very nice introduction to the whole specialization the structure of the course is very well developed contains quite a number of use cases that give illustrations to conflicts and possible resolutions the professors of the course invested quite some effort and time to it	3
very up to date and challengingonly drawback not a lot of application and octavematlab is good for a fast mathematical implementation but not for real application with python packages for examplethanks prof hinton for taking the time to make these insights publicly available	3
great course for newbies and also for professionals from related disciplines this was the first course i enrolled and after finishing it it left me with hunger for more knowledge on arduino platform and iot development so i enrolled for the whole specialization	4
given the great reviews i expected a lot more from this course it does cover some new developments and provides good examples but otherwise quite boring and standard fare	2
a brilliant course which enables students to understand the fundamentals of epigenetics this was my first online course and i am delighted to say that it was a wonderful experience and i gained immense insight into the field of epigenetics id strongly recommend it to prospective students and academicians	3
the assignments do not give you any practical methods for actual problem solving theyre just a succession of activities that pretend to be creative by making you do things you wouldnt normally do its like they forgot the part about problem solvingthe assignments are to eat foods youve never eaten talk to people you wouldnt normally talk to take a photo of yourself smooching someonesomething and to give something to someone you never have given anything before that is not creative nor helpful at problem solving its just a series of activities for people who have too much time on their hand and need something to do to get out of their routinenot a course i would recommend for anyone wanting to gain useful skills	0
great course love it and would definitely recommend	4
very interesting and should be extremely useful	4
very well explained and organized course material the classes are also very detailed and special emphasis is put on illustrating every concept with example plots	4
where is the actual information are some parts missing  are they payed  useless	0
the difficulty of assignments should be increased	2
the videos doesnt tell anything related to the test how can i know the answers am i going to search them on the internet then what the meaning to learn this course	0
this course is good	3
a terrific introduction to classical music by an engaging and accessible professor	4
really useful  well done	4
the course itself is  out of  overwhelmingly informative presented in a totally engaging manner lots and lots of visual aids fly in the ointment teaching assistants called mentors here apparently have come from very different including hierarchical societies and learners are required to take the mentors diversified background and attitude into consideration not vice versa	3
content very light near of empty course	0
the first course in this series was really good and this one was soso at best i got some skills out of it since i obsessively plotted everything and over did the assignments but the peer grading rubrics are crap its all or nothing so if you submit anything you get a grade and it usually approaches  but i didnt really get much helpfulthoughtful feedback on anything i did since you literally get zero feedback from the instructors nothing nor did i get much in the way of helpful info from the people who peer reviewed my work i find that pretty disappointing really	2
quite simple course for those who has already learned some python but has some drawbacks in knowledge of unit testing exceptions and classes all examples are understandable and simplealthough expected more about quality code crafting some hints and best practices that could help in real life of the developer	3
good information a bit basic though i wouldve enjoyed a more in depth course	2
amazing course	4
course project is way outside of what was taught in class	0
very basic no new material or ideas if youve been interested in the subject for a while but it might give you a fresh perspective on how to present some subjects to your audience	1
it is useful	2
course depends too much on multiple thirdparty sites to be as enlightening as i had hoped i learned about some great resources but thats about it	0
good as introduction but pretty basic for me	2
i liked it a lot but i didntt find helpful the assignments and how they were asked to be corrected the assignments ask you to list things that were seen during the course but dontt push the learner to think and look up for further information in the topic i have also taken business strategy also from university of illinois and in my opinion the assignments are very well conducted and the make you think and go beyond the course infoi think this is very important to address it properly because it is when the learner really acquire the knowledge when heshe has to connect what heshe has learnt with real cases	2
great course highly recommended	4
this is my second online class using couresa and what ive liked what has helped me so far in this class have been the videos i think i could have learned this on my own but its great listening to an actual instructor	4
simple but helpfulvery like the professer	4
this course contains quite some useful information but overall it seems way too simple most of what it talked about were the basics and what common high school students would know it could be much better if its depth could be made higher	1
korea and english are both improved	4
will knowing the stages of emerging technologies help in the real world applications there is no conclusion if knowing accomplishing anything	2
its a great introductory class but would like more personal feedback from professionals	2
i am really not sure if you need  minutes videos to explain the material  i think maybe  minutes clear with some good examples would be more helpful i fell sleep during some of the lectures boring long and not sure if necessary  on the other hand i guess  minutes is good because you learn to put up with arguments and clear them up yourself  also maybe this course was directed towards high school students thus the long explanations overall as i said on the beginning it would work better with clear definitions and some examples and discussion board 	1
course could be better	2
these courses have been a perfect mix of theory and practice looking forward to the final two courses in the specialization getting released at some point in the future 	4
only very very basics they wont teach you make well formed html documents complete css files or learn to program in javascript	1
very good course for introduction to ml must have	4
interesting and insightful course indeed	3
you will learn nothing from this the teacher is useless and you only get peerfeedback while i usually love peer feedback i lost all interest so quickly	0
a great introduction to business strategy tools which gets exponentially more complex when you apply them in the followon course i really appreciated the deep but approachable theoretical discussions of economic rents and the professors serious efforts to bring together business and economic principles as a former student of economics it gave me a great anchor point in the coursewhile i really appreciate the casebased method the volume of students just isnt high enough to allow for much vigorous discussion on the forums or wasnt for me i would highly recommend taking the course with a friend or colleague and setting aside time to connect each week to get the most out of the case discussions	3
need more excercises	3
hi my name is kapil raj and i am from india this is the first course i have done from coursera its an awesome course its a great course for someone who have just wanted to learn programming or have a little prior knowledge in programming	2
you cant do the assignments unless you pay the subscription the founding idea of moocs was to make education more accesible how do you test your knowledge if you cant submit assignments i understand paying for a certificate but i dont want the certificate	0
this is an extremely basic course in my opinion it isnt worth  and is thrown in just to add to the total price of the specialization it is a useful refresher but doesnt really contain much information just a couple of topics are covered at a very basic level you could also get this info from watching youtube videos	2
great quality lectures and fun real life examples would be even better if more structured background literature was given and more connections were being drawn between coursework from different weeks	3
first off i think the course content is amazing i really like that the instructor used matlab that encourages the user to create vectorized solutions to the problems i have heard many negative comments regarding the lack of use of python r or some other library like cafe or tensorflow but i believe all of that should follow after having the mathematical background to understand these principles the content is not easy and requires a fair bit of mathematical sophistication but not so much to lose me and hard enough to keep me engaged i really enjoy how each learning unit builds off of the previous one for instance linear regression become logistic regression which becomes a neural networkthat being said i really think that this course needs to have a fresh coat of paint on it i believe it was filmed in  i dont think the content really has been revamped since its release the recordings look like they were filmed on an old web cam not even as good as a modern iphone the slides should have some design work on them i know it seems petty to stress over the presentation but i think many people are turning to programs from udacity that are very flashy but not as technically rigorous mainly i feel just because of the presentation i think that this course deserves a bit of energy polishing it up since its still perhaps the most popular mooc course out there	3
interesting but monotonous lectures	3
good course but the programming exercises didnt run with the new version of octave without some changes	4
this is part  in the robotics specialization the course content is way too short and basic for the price there are about  minutes of lecture in total ie less than  minutes per week the first week covers bfs dijkstra and a something part of most undergrad programs the rest of the material is ok but very basic the programming assignments are implement dijkstra in week  implement dijkstra on a torus and do triangles intersect in week  a very simple for loop in week  and implement gradient descent in week  i could complete the course by looking at it onandoff over one weekendthe material that is presented is presented well but theres not enough of itfor reference part  of the robotics specialization had over twice as much lecture content by time and then lots of supplementary material in addition to that quizzes that required some thinking and more relevant and at least slightly harder programming assignments	0
great class for graduate students ive always struggles with learning throughout my education and got frustrated and stressed out much easily i understand why now	4
well structured course the graphs used to highlight the key relationships of various variables is insightful	3
excellent course highly recommended	4
material is to basic for an entire course	0
could offer and cover much more subjectsspend too much time on basics less on advancedcould have chosen better music examples	1
i really had a hard time understanding dynamic programming i recoomend to remove this topic and focus more on solidifying foundations so that students can be more prepared for moving through the whole algorithm courses i never heard of this topic before and the lecturer ommited many steps when explaining the edit distance i was forced to look for other resources like open courseware algorithms course and this is how could understand what was dynamic programming easily hope this helps	2
excellent course workloved the lectures	4
the material are great so much information and it is the first from the hole specializationbut the explanation is so weak doesnt match at all with this big datathe pseudocode is so distracting and hard to readi always get lost and i dont know is it an array in the code or variable and what does he want to do with itthe pseudocode should be just a normal english code saying what to donot an understandable signs i am really sad that i couldnt get benefits from this amount of knowledge	1
a lot of the concepts in stats inf  although simple when you think about it and used pretty much every day  i felt were difficult to understand at first wikipedia and some other online sources and youtube videos were more helpful but i think the real issue lay in the teaching style i wont knock mr caffo like some of the others here have because at the end of the day everyone learns differently what works for some might not work for others and unfortunately his style did not suit my learning requirementsmy rating is purely based on the content which i think can be simplified by giving more visual examples i am rating this after taking the regression models course and in that course it is much easier because he gives real time and visual examples of what eg residuals mean or represent just that alone made a huge difference and it then helps me focus on how to write the r code rather than trying to understand the math hope this helps	1
excellent course it definitely provides a smooth way of introducing project management from a highlevel and shot the big picture i also like the use of situational exercises to confirm my understanding of the course	4
i really learned a lot about diplomacy this course is very wellstructured	4
the lectures made by the professor were really helpful and provided many insights into policy making within the eu however some tasks such as filling air pollution standards were not that insightful also unsynchronized subtitles were a bit annoying same for the poor sound from invited professors in air pollution videos of chapters  and 	2
was initially nervous going into this course however the information examples and presentation were really easy to follow and understand well done	4
i was quite disappointed with this class the videos and instructions are very short and the information is lacking when reviewing other classmates material it was quite clear that people were confused with the assignments because i saw such a huge range of submissions that were very different from each otheri found the material to be very similar to the first course in this specialization both asked very similar things but this class didnt add much to the process	0
perfect class	4
the cloud computing service with amazon described in the course is not free anymore i was charged money for using it the course also took much more time to complete than i wanted to spend i believe a better design of the project could lead to a more efficient less frustrating learning experience details belowthe usegalaxy server was extremely slow as shown in the course i installed an instance of galaxy in the awsamazon cloud i was under the impression that this was a free service for the first year amazon has changed its interfaces and i could not do the installation as recommended but i managed to run a few analyses with some workarounds i did not explicitely terminated the galaxy instance for   days charges of  accumulatedthe course project in week  was far beyond what was covered in the lectures it took me a whole week spending multiple hours every day many deadend roads coupled with extremely long run times on the galaxy servers resulted in very inefficient learning and many frustrations help via the discussion forum was critical to design an analysis pipeline  so thank you dejan and all contributors for the supportthis is not a course i could easily do parttime i dont have time to read the fine print on what is available for free on amazon nor do i have time to go through all of the tools on galaxy to find out what would be the best for my analysison the positive side i think galaxy is a great tool	0
very nice introductory course looking at questions of	3
i really enjoyed this course i liked the forced research into microcontrollers and embedded systemsi would however like to stress that the use of peer reviewed assignments slows the pace of the class down greatly people sometimes like to progress a lot faster difficult to do when waiting for others	3
starts very simplistically since i was auditing the class there was no feedback for quizes of exercises	2
the course is very light on substance there are significantly better courses and books available on the same subject matter i definitely would not recommend this course	0
found it to be a bit outdated	2
the content is already old and needs to be updated of course it is still actual but still  the newest text are from  so newer examples would be great	2
lectures notes is not details enough had to google around other materials to grasp the courser work better	2
it was like someone is reading a book for you there was no need to watch videos it wasnt even helping your memory just  instructor standing still in front of camera and reading from a file in flat voice	1
one of the best designs for python courses ive seen so far this was truly a great experience	4
it was good 	3
great introduction about the topic	3
the content although very basic is interesting and some of the teachers insights do stimulate discussion but the video quality is low with non matching slides etc	2
this course would work better if the material wasn	2
honestly i cannot believe that this course wont allow people to go an extra mile to make something better and learn more than what course was designed for how is it possible that i try to do something different and better than what i was requested to do and because of that i got bad gradings because it was different even though it met the projects requirements i left a complaint and this is the response from one of the mentors john f davis replied all i could say is keep your personal touch in your github and submit the nonpersonal touch version to be gradedhow is this going to allow the students to learn more if they are going to be graded badly if they do if we are not allowed to work on something greater im disappointed with the peer grading system but even more with this kind of attitude from a mentor	1
instructor is just reading out slides hence its not that exciting to watch the lectures just can read through slides to complete it	2
but more depth is required	3
this course is really cool y	4
this is one of best courses in power electronics i have learned  they are worth learning thank you  professors	4
extremely basic	1
did not learn anything useful at all	0
although a neat idea i was a little disappointing to find that over the course of  weeks wed only be creating and adding to a small paper game i was hoping for something a little more in depth and although i dont disagree that this course provided some wonderful input to creating a game i felt that it was something that could have been done in a single lesson	2
congrats professor	4
i waited a long time for this class to start but now that it is here i find it impossible summon enough will to pay attention to the lectures as a retired teacher i have more of an ability to stick to a class than many but life is too short to wait for this class to perk up the professors seem very knowledgable but their teaching methodology leaves a lot to be desired	0
not well prepared and not well explained they throw formulas at you and read it aloud instead of explaining the nature behind thosethey change notations every lecture sometimes in the same lecture its easy but these things made it artificially dificultat least its better than the next one in the specialization	1
the lectures are a little bit confused	3
a good basic review of healthy eating habits	3
introduces the fundamentals of tableau and gave examples of story board explored basic functions of tableau a good introduction course to tableau	3
the videos were a bit confusing and gave me the impression that it was a patchwork from old lectures	2
no starsanother boring animal class that i would not recommend the teachers do seem nice and well educated however it is still too boring and slow for me	0
thanks it just needs more time	1
i really enjoyed this course it was very informational and fun	3
sometimes the person who is speaking it doesnt inderstand very wellsome exercises it doesnt understand very welltheyll asume you yave more experience that they wanted for this coursei think it would be if they give more examples and exercise for the assigmentsregards	3
as a manager in an it consultancy i cant justify sending my personnel through this course even at  per course the amount of information gained is very thin and does not move one toward being productive	0
quite poor just a lot of talk and nothing practical	1
really informative great teacher and i learnt a lot from this	4
bias towards the american healthcare system and deathly boring only take this course you have to	1
i thought the course is about showing us some examples of responsive web designs and how to make creative responsive websites as the title suggestbut the course is about  basic websites and how they are developed using meteorit goes on describing how to code this stuff and how the code logic is written and add a little to the meteor learning experiencei suggest you change the title of the course to be what the course is really about	2
some good content however text has numerous spelling mistakes and there is no involvement by academic staff nor can one see ones answers to quizzes once done nor standard answers provided as with so many coursera moocs little involvement by fellow students in discussion fora no certificate on completion which is a pity because the cost of a purchased one is somewhat prohibitive for third world students with our exchange rates	1
lots of content and interesting interviews though there may have been a superfluity of them oftentimes i found myself not paying attention because i was waiting for important information to be delivered	3
this course was very important for my work i learned so much and i want to say thanks to the professors	4
incredible i really learned from this course	4
its an interesting course	2
extremely boring and very confusing	0
ive just completed the course subject to peer review grading i must say that this was the worst online course ive ever taken and ive taken a lot of online courses including youtube tutorials by people who were clearly intoxicated when creating their masterpiecesto begin the recommended software options for screen movies and presentation are awful choices  not to mention prezi is subscription service i didnt use it try open office which has a powerpoint type presentation software if you are looking to save costs theres also an enormous technical problem with the screen movie makers suggested at least with the pc versions you cannot record from your microphone and capture internal sound card information ie sounds produced by your daw simultaneously with any of the suggested programs i tried the solution was a virtual sound card i used voice meeter where i could route the sounds accordingly so you could hear the sound produced by my daw while i spoke considering this is a technology course you would think this would be addressed it is notthere is almost no practical discussion theres plenty of what  an overwhelming amount of what actually  but not much how or whyothers may experience this course differently depending on your goals if you record vocals and real instruments and want to learn how to do this so everything sounds fantastic this isnt the course for you theres a tiny bit of that discussed with microphone placement and the like but it quickly moves to digital sound creation if you want to use synths and effects and noise things and such to create edm music  well this isnt the course for you either but maybe it would be more beneficial to you than most other categoriesso who is this course for i cant say im sure of the answer to that if you are wanting to be a sound designer perhaps you would learn the vocabulary for sound design but not much how if you use logix as your daw perhaps you will learn where something is you hadnt seen before although the videos are hard to follow as some things are happening off screen or arent the focus of the videoin the end this course was very much a self teaching course i didnt learn much from the video lectures provided by berklee other than application of a few terms in music id never considered much with a background in playing instruments rather than playing a digital synth like adsr i spent more time on other websites and youtube videos and in my daws operation manual as we were often told go to your daw and figure out how to use an xyz rarely did it include how and why to use that xyz for musicalitythe quizzes were awful as well theres a lot of minutia detail in the lectures that never seems to have any relevance because theres no practical application discussed make sure you know this not very relevant information because it will be on the quiz  like how to determine the word length and bit depth using some formula involving  to the power of something it still doesnt make since because i dont know why or how it appliesalso note that not everything is completely uniform in daws with some terms being different in each one this was extremely confusing because i dont use logix and the lessons do i had a terrible time figuring out many things simply because my daw had another term or button name for itim glad this is over i feel like i learned a little bit but dont feel like its information ill retain for long since i have no idea how to use much of the information for my purposes maybe on a game of jeopardysorry for the length of this but i hope you find the information helpful in deciding whether you will benefit from this class	1
good as just an introduction to data science some more exercises using github maybe some collaborative works would have been nice	2
almost totally ignores the ancients a skewed view of philosophy from an enlightenment perspective	1
i was expecting something else very basic information	0
i did not learn a lot	1
lots of talking head videos without enough visual aids to solidify the adult learning process not very executive level as the course title and description imply i would expect more ted talk level lectures and materials with plenty of realworld examples content in these courses seem more new manager  new supervisor level if not actually geared toward an undergrad audience	2
very learner friendlyi like his numerical approach to demonstrate concept or a formula	4
very informative course which has encouraged me to research the topic further and to adopt a healthier lifestyle based on my research however i believe a mistake might have been made according to the instructional material the only group of essential fatty acids is omega based on my research however essential fatty acids include ala an omega fatty acid and la which is an omega fatty acid	3
excellent introductory course into website development	4
extremely clear presentations by the researchers but loses  stars for relying on assignments based on google docs which did not load properly and resulted in me not being able to complete the course	1
my suggestions videos pace is way too fast and without much visuals and a clear structureplan hard to fully grab in one view i dont think your mn max duration really makes sense when the content is of interest better to make it longer to improve clarity positive you provide writtentext versions of your videos support documents way too many and not always relevant quizzes i dont think that asking us the name of a founder etc really test anything about our understanding of our lesson too many irrelevant questionsall in all it seems you applied one of the rules you discuss in this course release fast and adjust later on based on customers feedback unsure this is the right approach when it comes to online learning i had higher expectations vs mines telecom	1
too many things i already know and which are quite obvious when you have some little computer science knowledge less practical information the explanations for installing cloudera etc are insufficient	0
taking this course in january february  i found it to be jumbled outdated and frustratingmaterials are presented in a chaotic roundabout way which is neither chronological nor thematic leaving huge lacunae the initial lecture started with an entirely uncontextualised locationvisit to lewes and mention of the battle of lewes in the barons war with plenty of merry jumping over the rather more important magna carta in later lectures there is similar dancing around the english civil war which is shocking given its constitutional importance and then lots of vague handwavy references to european law i understand that these lectures were filmed before last summers shock result in the eu referendum but  honestly  would it have killed professor gearey to have discussed the context and possible implications of the referendum by contrast im currently following a futurelearn course which is a repeat iteration of the original material thats how online courses are viable  i understand that but which the educator cared about enough to updated with topical material from the very week in which we were following it week  of president trumpit would have been far better to have gone into the common law course with clear historical anchors eg magna carta civil war great reform act eu membership which would have given a proper framework for studying the development of common law through cases and precedent instead we get professor gearey sliiiiiiding into half a dozen subjects per lecture and then leaving that question there for a later lecturei must mention that other lecturer is much more coherent and that he talks sensibly through various cases actually demonstrating how precedent works however thats just not enough to make up for professor geareys flibbertigibbet style of exposition which seems to make up the bulk of the courseon a technical level the uncorrected transcripts of lectures were a huge headache since they didnt make much more sense than the lectures themselves and at times made even less sense due to incorrect transcriptions it was particularly frustrating to have legal references misspelled eg blackstone as blackspen making it difficult to track down better sources to supplement the lecturesi cant actually be bothered to see this course through to the end and am very glad i didnt purchase it	0
very useful	4
this was a challenging and rewarding course for me the coursework and instructor videos really made me focus for the last two months to work hard and learn new concepts	4
great course to start pythonand good teacher	4
seemed like the capstone was rushed and turned into an investment management coursei signed up to practice business finance modeling not investment management the instructors did not present any further information and referred students to thirdparty resources ie investopedia and youtube many students in the forums voiced their frustration disappointing course with little added value and in my opinion hurts whartons imageoverall the wharton online business finance modeling specialization is not worth the us if i could i would ask for a refund	0
i found the course good overall but the tempo was a bit slow for me and i thought that the online lectures could have been provided in a shorter period of time ideal for a beginner but i had some previous experience with pfa	2
i liked everything about this course except that some of the lesson materials couldnt be viewed on my ipad as they were flash based other than that the videos were good  not too long not too short  and the quizzes were suitably based on what was discussed beforehand in the lectures and lessons i also picked up one of the recommended readings fast forward mba in project management which i also liked	3
first of all this course is a quality product lectures are clear and effective and exercises are challenging enough perhaps the conclusion now you can consider yourself an expert in machine learning techniques is a slight exaggeration but certainly you are made aware of those techniques enough to think about using them effectively and getting some resultsand as an added bonus you will learn the basics of octavematlab which is not a bad thing since as stated in the course they are great prototyping toolsits certainly a recommended course for whoever deals with data analysis problems where perhaps a killer machine learning system is not the priority but some solid conclusions about the data are essential	4
there wasnt a lot of information inside the video and the tests questions hade multiple possible answerhowever the links to ressources such as harvardreview or inccom were pretty good and usefull	1
i would have liked some more depth in the course while the course name says punctuation it deals only with commas and to a small extent with semicolons the assignments and practice exercises need to be tougher also given that this course is taken by students from all over the globe it should mention that the serial comma is not mandatory in all writing styles	2
this course was great for an introductory course to food and health because it emphasized getting back to the basics of real food and cooking simply it lost a star because i felt like there were certain topics that needed a more in depth and less cursory approach they were almost dismissive at times for the sake of keeping it simple whereas a simple suggestion about washing produce to remove pesticides couldve been helpful	3
i feel there are many more topics to discuss for this course i also feel that the topics discussed could be examined in further detail and at a slower pace and there were times when the speaker was quiet or the microphone didnt work properly and i had a difficult time hearing what was being talked about	1
could be summarised in parts but generally good course	3
you have access to the material but you have to pay  usd to take simple quizzes	1
its a very interesting and interactive course i recommend it a lot	4
this class is very insightful for those interested in pursuing any career having to do with global health or traveling i am not pursuing a career in this field therefore it didnt entirely appeal to me but professor boyd is very passionate and knowledgable at what he does	2
this astronomy course is good but for people that are more interesting in the big bang theory and how the universe came into existence today	3
dreadful course instructors saw no value in presenting elements of course that would help learners complete the assignments rather you are sent off to teach yourself about uncovered techniques needed to complete the assignments from some of the posts from previous students on github they resorted to deriving the answer from another means excel and simply providing the answer as a constant value in order to receive credit for particular questions not exactly sterling knowledge transfer from instructor to student this course should be presented as a challenge course to people that have already learned python pandas from some other venue btw pandas documentation is also dreadful as of this writing this is definitely not the way to learn python for data science if you are a busy professional software engineer wish i had a good recommendation as an alternativethe only positive aspect of this course is the challenge to work with defined datasets to complete specific tasks during week  this was as much time as i could afford to allocate to this coursefrom a  year software engineer with doctorate in cs a parttime instructor at a private university with a very challenging technology job in a multinational corporation	1
extremely fun and helpful	4
this planning course was slightly better than the preceding landscape course but it was still underwhelming the instructor seemed better prepared with her presentation but her dependence on the textbook and speaking style still made it seem as if she lacked mastery of the subject the course did touch on the important subject matters at hand but since the textbook was so old practically outdated by digital media standards it missed or made little mention of so many innovations and best practices that are now the rule for digital marketers for example the increasingly crucial role of marketing automation platforms like hubspot dynamics marketing and marketo and how crms like salesforce and dynamics are driving both marketing and sales strategy another example is how email marketing has moved to rulesbased and triggered workflows again theres a definite need for this course i would actually recommend breaking out social seo and online advertising into their own courses rather than squeezed into small segments finally the putting it all together section is vital for anyone who wants to work in digital marketing but the coverage here was much too general	1
inattentive lectures therere only a few videos that are worth watching you need to be prepared for wasting a lot of time for programming assignments  its not because the assignments are tough but because of poor descriptions and out of sync with lectures if youre interested just download the online material not videos and read through it much better than wasting your time with the lecture videos and assignments	0
excellent course with challenging projects teaches essential techniques for mongodb	4
could not follow very easily confused gained nothing from the lectures really no substance to it	0
clear instructions good for beginners	2
longer than expected you could move more of the content into the third section and balance the time commitment	2
good information but way too short for what coursera charges	2
imho a very superficial courselots of outdated material usergenerated content was a big thing  to  years ago not anymore lacked going in depthit discouraged me from pursuing the rest of the specialisation	0
too much theory too little real life examples	3
unfortunately the content of the course is poor too many interviews and some of them are pointless	1
this course is awesome so very interesting	4
i think for somebody who has no prior knowledge in this course will find it difficult to understand i have taken some introductory courses in swift programming and were much more elaborating than this for instance the part i think in week  were jack wu explains closures functions enums structs in less than min i studied that in around  hours atleast in other visual tutorials online in the last lecture on image processing the instructor gave minutes tutorial on manipulating image pixels and then gave a link to a website to explain everything about imageprocessing a much heavier topic than working with pixels and even it was not in swift but objectivec which i have no knowledge in that language and it wasnt stated in the course that it was a prerequisitefinal assignment is quite vague on the requirements needed by the instructor would have prefered to have more interaction with the instructors on the assignment atleast im not the only one complaining about this issue you can check the discussion in the course i guess im fortunate that i have already studied those courses from external sources before i started hereone of the instructors speaks quite fast with alot of anxiety making it quite difficult to understand without repeating the video	0
great course	4
course title is misleading it is actually a course on managing agile software development not product managementthere is common understanding in active product management community that major focus for product manager is market market is not mentioned in this course at allwhat requirements and schedule guys current product management is all about hypotheses ab testing customer development experiments lean ux etcyou completely missing the pointstill this course can be a good one for those who want to start managing agile software development	0
awesome course but i think it was a very short course i wish it had more contentvery expensive course for this amount of contentstill i really like it 	3
great coursecomplex terms simplified and explained well by all professors	4
creativity without a reason without a real problemquestion divergent thinking per se try to be divergent just to be divergent too simplistic doesnt worth your time	0
learned a lot of new things very interesting course all  weeks	4
the presenter are very annoying and i did not learn anything from this	0
full of useful information and easy to follow the concepts are well explained	3
the testing in this course is horribly crafted not is it only too easy thus not actually testing students what is learned the answers for some of the questions are incorrect on the very last quiz i was not able to finish the course because the answer for one of the questions was incorrect in answering how to translate south the answer should be nánbian but when i selected this option it was marked wrong therefore i have to wait  more hours before selecting an incorrect answer to complete the course	1
very well paced course assignments are related to course material and are very good are cementing course topics very good course	4
awful monotonous way of talking i have such a great interest in this topic but listening to her makes me want to rip my eyeballs out	0
this course has nothing to do with emerging technologies the course is essentially a quick history of android and ios smartphones that could be learned by browsing wikipedia	0
this course is much more informative than the previous two in my opinion i liked the sample spreadsheets provided i still however feel the price is a bit steep compared to other similar courses you can find online the quizzes arent that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more	2
i am very dissatisfied with how there was absolutely no outside helpfeedback from instructors or mentors in the forums when clearly the final project was outside the scope of the material presented in the future it would helpful if either the lectures were modified to be more helpful in completion of the final project or the final project to be reflected of material in the lectures either way i felt like i taught myself all of this material using web resources and got absolutely nothing for what i paid for	1
using a proprietary library instead of widely used libraries and discouraging the use of open source widely used libraries it barely compiles the example notebook has method calls that use non existing methods of the sframe objectthe course claims that it teaches the student how useful practical knowledge but then ends up using a non standard library and saying not to use pandas or scikit learn	0
very basic info suited for highschool students many errors in transcripts that you will just have to slog through	1
i saw a few typos and missing translations in the english transcripts one minor issue in a quiztest	3
great course	3
this instructor reads of a script he rushes through the hard things and slows through the easy things	1
materials in class are not suficient to understand the subject there is missing swirl excercises and other hands on practical work in data science specialization this one is the one with most space for improvement keep the good work br	2
it was a good course however it seems that the recording was from the earlier course which i dont mind however some of the comment wasnt relevant so it was a bit weirdin terms of content and how the course run it was beyond my expectation the list of literature provided were quite extesive and strategicaly choseni wish theres a whole syllabus that we can access in the beginning of the course to prepare for the assignment	3
the professor is very knowledgable however the course has too much memorized stuff to remember especially when students try to finish the tests one more thing though at the beginning of the class the professor notified that beatles songs wont be played in the class due to copyright reason but when students really go through the whole class it is very hard to follow isnt music all about feeling but the class is more like a history class  	2
the professor is just reading the text not really a good example of interactive elearning content	0
this is a good fundamental course colleen is a great teacher and i like her unique teaching style and viewpoint	2
this course offers great background instruction on machine learning and i would give it  stars except for the followingfirst there doesnt seem to be any moderation of the session discussions except for help from other students this was worth a  star penalty this and the lack of any review of linear algebra and vectorized solutions i think is giving some students the impression that they should be coding loops in their functions to build and solve ml modelsnext i am auditing the course and this is the first course where i was not able to submit quizzes therefore i can only guess at my solutions this was worth a  star penaltyupdate not being able to submit quizzes is a feature of the new coursera platform i never did get an answer from the discussion forums but i see the same problem in other coursera courses i am takinghowever i still think the course is worth taking so i added back a star this is the second ml course i have taken the first was from stanford ml course which was very specific to implementation in the octave language i got a lot more background information from this course and i think it is well taught just wish there were more moderators that were actively watching the discussion list	2
quiz and especially assignments were poorly written spelling mistakes in slides is simply unacceptable in highlevel academia in my opinion especially for a course designed for a global audience	2
this is a lie i do everything i complete week  and now i come back to watch videos about week  and i see that i dont do anythingcan you imagine good job guyz	0
chuck does a terrific job of explaining and describing the trials and tribulations of learning to program in python	4
its the basic introduction courses for data science and its good we can learn a lot from this	3
that was very informative and motivating course i wish the quiz was not that detail oriented and hard	2
felt that it could have more writing exercises	2
this class isnt very good it is confusing and not well explained and the quizzes are too short and badly written i gave up on week  of  because i just didnt feel i was learning very much particularly about what the title of the course would suggest youd be learning about	1
probably guys did big amount of work but the course looks extremely raw half of lectures time is talking about nothing and it seems that there were no lecture plan before shooting the video it would have been ok if the course had been free but i expected much more from it for that pricethank you for you work but i think you need to keep improving the quality of the course	1
very short quality of the course is also not that good	1
the subjectes are not learnt deeply and precisely too summarized and vague	1
this class felt a bit elementary    but it had some good material as well i would appreciate a bit less overacting and goofiness which actually praised in the course and have a bit more academic material in one of the videos the professor suggested that teaching should be slightly above the students level but not too high this course seemed to be a bit lower than my level but i have taken education courses in the past	2
setting up the development environment is sadly dated github has changed and doesnt match the videos so any information delivered doesnt help get someone up and running videos run way to fast when someone is working between multiple windows to accomplish tasks update info in videos and course would have value expecting people to pay to update tech skills in unrealistic in todays competive environment when you are competing against other pla	1
the grader functionality is bullshit working code needs to be fitted to the way its excepted to be	1
interesting approach but i expected more useful information on gastronomy	2
the course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive there are many examples in it but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative processthe high level process proposed is good but it is into the details where the processes fails and there are no detailed examples hereby far the worst thing related to this course is the peer review they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined i really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money	0
thanks for your help	4
i loved the beginning of the course and the information about darwin i may agree with dawson but i find him too darn smug i once watched a documentary about intelligent design another scientist told him how lucky he was to have such fame wealth and good health he asked him if he died and found a godwhat would he think dawsons answer was and im not exactly quoting but he	3
thank u so much	3
paid for the course and never took it terrible professor teaching the course the format was poorly put together and just wasnt overall a very good course	0
this class should be promoted further	4
content was good but occasionally very hard to understand the lecturers english worth taking though	1
all algorithms were black boxed it was a nice course on how to use datos graphlab and an overview of ml concepts	2
really good great for beginners need to get rid of slides with white text on green background	3
if this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips the capstone would be that bland chip that didnt get any saltthe introduction to the capstone promises that well build applications utilizing what weve learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper however none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities if you can download a file and take a screenshot then youve got what it takes to pass this classthe optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed unfortunately the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the classin fact the entire capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived betatest ive ever been a part of such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization	0
i dont feel this course is always very clear i feel that i usually am missing the big picture i follow it in details but the pace does not match in terms of how you can view the big picture of it	1
extraordinary course well done	4
very very very very good course i learned quite a lot from it thanks professor	4
sorry but this is awful literally just reading from some very high level slides no dept to the course i cannot recommend this course in its current state	0
very poorly constructed there are major jumps in the difficulty of material that are completely unnecessary the material could very easily be broken down into more manageable and comprehensible chunks there is no repetition of any exercise or function to engrain any of the material this course suffers grossly from the curse of knowledge if it were structured in a way where a material was broken down into smaller bits ideally as beta tested by true rank novices and b all materials or specific functions were presented with repetition similar to how khan academy structures its math section then this course would be much better i would also assume given a and b that there would be higher retention and comprehension the expected time requirements are also wildly amiss try beta testing this on true rank novices the program suggests that this is for beginners i find it doubtful that a true beginner would fare well in this course	0
good course overall	2
took the first two courses which were fine but this one started off poorly and just got worse unfortunately im wondering if i can get my money back	0
i didnt get much out of it	1
really poor approach to grade this course regardless of the effort put in on assignments peer reviews are inconsistent unguided and poor as a result bringing down the final grade one is likely to obtain on a course there is also a limited course support from the staff and no feedback in general for any of the issues raise personally i would not recommend	0
no actual class just for selling books	0
i have almost completed week one i learned about what words to stress in a sentence and how to use the innotation at the end of the sentence it is fun to go through the course contents i would have given it five stars when it actually have helped us by giving analogies on more conversations formally and informally well thank you	3
the course has nearly nothing to do with the previous themes i already have had enough knowledge but as there is no support by the team it seems to be rather time consuming for others	1
good course for introduction to special relativity i expected more related to emc derivation	3
great course	3
exceptional lecturer  thanks sir	4
i cant even begin to describe how much pain this course gave methe code snippets and instructions in the exercise videos are incompletehave errors and its impossible to complete the exercises just using those its hours of extra work to get things working also at some point you are given a new version of part of the files in the project which wont match the rest of the files so theres remedial work to be done for that too some of these issues were flagged on the forum  months ago and still the course material wasnt updated it all gets even worse as all assignments build upon the code written in these exercisesthe assignment instructions are unclear you are shown a demo of how the solution should look in the assignment videos and then you are told you actually have to build something different than what you were shown i also couldnt understand some of the grading criteria you will getlose marks on uploading a screenshot or naming variablesfunctions a certain wayi was really interested in this specialization so i kept going hoping it will get better but it only got worse after  weeks of work i am ready to start something different wasnt expecting such low quality content on coursera	0
not useful at all if its audited	0
matlab is very out of trends nowdays	2
well i think i learnt some things about javascript html and css however the course hasnt been focused on programming with javascript to solve real problems all assignments are based on the creation of images from scratch the modification of these images and hide messages in an original image i really dont think these types of assignments can help students to learn web technology in fact i know some professional web programmers that they dont use javascript to manipulate images but in some cases when it is really necessary id change the way of how the assignments are presented to prove the students skills for example a possible assignment could be the implemention of a counter on a web page using javascript or the creation of a web page with buttons emerging messages menus etc on the web googling there are a lot of codes that allow these funcionalities and could be used and modified by other students to create their own web page	2
great practical insights a relatively slowpaced course so that you can easily deepen your knowledge mr ng is a genius and a very good lecturer for sure i only had problems with the audiovideo quality sometimes	3
i am finding it very difficult to follow feel like i am missing a chunk of information however i will say that everyone else seems to be managing so it is probably me missing something	2
covers the basics of geopolitics in a very concise and interesting manner	4
nicely organized to learn the practical implications and the intervention techniques	3
the course material is good and casey always gives further reads and references i specially liked to have book references and i started to read one of thosei found however a disconnection between the idea of using the mdadpe framework described in the course and the actual projects which were more into creating the set of documents used in game design to collect the details create a better picture and think better about the game in some way the iterative process of coming back to the idea from document to document helped to refine the game but it happened more as something naturali wished we would have had some sort of checklist to evaluate and apply during the design process the frameworkas feedback to the instructor i think he needs to stop using the ending word right to finish his sentences at some point of the course it became really difficult to follow right right right  ufff also i believe he knows a lot but a bit of preparation and flow in his lectures would be appreciated maybe the use of some sort of autoclue would helplast but this could be more for the course editors the instructor has good slides and material but usually during the lectures the slides disappear just in the moment one need to focus his attention in the written material and the instructor appears in first plane i think you could keep the instructor in a pip box all the time and perhaps put him in first plane only at the beginning and end	2
basic course	2
i am sorry but this course is made by pr specialist people that should know how to talk to the publicsome teachers of this specialisation should been trained on how to behave in front of a camerathe content is nice but you repeat too many time the same stuff in a very neutral voice so it is really hard to keep watching the coursethanks for sharing your knowledge it is really helpful and rich but as communication specialist you cant just read a text you have to live itthe source is important when releasing a message  thats what you said  the source should a good cv but also has to know how to present the message	1
if anybody truely wants to learn and use the data structure using python you are at right place exercise was really very good	4
some of his information was useful its pretty basic	2
its terrible if one wants to accomplish the quiz using garud iyengars notes examples in his notes were not well explained	0
very slow and boring needs better and more relevant examples instruction should be more fast paced	1
complete waste of time this should be a course on its own and much less be charged for this should have been the st week of an actual class this only dealt with installing a couple of software tools hopefully the following courses will teach something worthwhile	0
extremely high level	2
this course is the first one in the data science series to lapse in terms of the clarity of the lectures and the sense of cohesiveness of the material brian caffos lectures in statistical inference were good in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing abouta more structured final project would have been helpful the instructions on this project werent quite so blunt as to say take this data set do some regressiony stuff and come back with something about these two variables but thats basically as far as our instructions went it could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis but instead an assignment which was  of our grade was put together as an afterthought it was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the  a block away from a birthday party to buy a cardalso in terms of delivering the content mr caffo needs to structure his slidevideo arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text think of it from the point of view of somebody wanting to listen and read at the same time	1
it is ok	2
always good to learn how to communicate in an efficient way even with new technology	3
nothing good in this course	0
it was very difficult for me to follow the exercises since i dont have a programming background	2
i didnt find this course to be too helpful	0
the professor was very goodbut there is a lot of assignments a lot of record videos  every week  and the assignments it was very long for example  instruction for every assignment it is very boringmany people dont like record videos it is a bad idea	0
very badly linked with other websites that provide the actual content this is more like a clickbait setup than the actual course im not sure why its even offered on coursera other than to make money on a more popular website using the content hosted by less popular one very bad experience	0
it is a great course they should just expand more and do more questions the tmbok guide goes why deeper they should also but nether the less it is a great course	3
this course is easy to understand	4
very limited material	0
really badly organised course lectures are interesting however end of section quizes have no relevance to the material taught there are no external links or additional relevant material attached to even link the question to the lessons taught	0
i would give this lecture a three because it is a very independent and useful course but i feel like the presentation skills could have been improved upon and found the information very dry i really liked the intent and where she was goingit was easy to follow and complete although there was something missing for me	2
the distributions were not well explained it could have been handled in a much better way	0
could have been more hands on	2
there is a wide gap between the lectures and the practice its clear that the video material is completely inadequate and insufficient for the course a poor introduction to programming	0
great course to get you started with web scraping	3
its format needs a good narrator not based on stupid commercials	0
the lecturers try to keep the instructions basic and pedagogical pretty good everything in this revolves around a tool graphlab create not so great i think it is not free you get a one year licence and hides all the action from the user i dont like that the course then makes me feel that i must rely on a specific product to solve problems	0
once you set the video speed to  it improves a lot 	3
great info	3
a really great course with great guest speakers and masterfully delivered by professor raj	4
sorry but the variable peer reviews ruined this course for me i either did not get enough reviews or a prankster would down mark for whatever reason they had in their head at that particular moment the staff dont seem interested in this a a problem and there is no way to rate a bad reviewer so they get away with itthe other courses in the specialisation are great but this one gives very little in the way of tuition and relies on the whole on peers which for me didnt work out too well	0
content  thxdelivery interaction total average  	1
the video is ok but it lacks a lot of details in calculation the assignment is very confusing because some questions refer to some previous statement while fail to clarify which is related	2
few specifics and examples	1
the assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python that being said the lectures were absolutely useless i spent  of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow the jupyter platform is also very frustrating for whatever reason error messages kept coming up as i was trying to complete the assignments at one point i lost all my work because of this error	1
very basic could be improved by increasing the level of complexity	2
this course is a rare example of how its not done presentation is unstructuredseems to be a student project where his professor helps along to check certain topics the student has to include to get a good grade	0
a good course who teaches the way you have to do to write correctly a scientific paper and gives an idea about the process of publish it is useful and necessary for those who wants to continuous study and have their own work knows on the fields who works and research	2
not good at allwe see different processes without anyone making clear the reason why we should apply this processes under which conditions and what is the question that we have to answer when we apply these processesthe only good is that we get into some new terms and see new thingsi could say that for meit wouldnt make such a difference if it wasnt in this specialization	0
the lectures get you through the basics in a clear understandable waybut the autograder was really a bad idea that got the lecturer into a lot of trouble for very little gain if anyit seems to me that peerreviewed assessments with proper instructions are better suited apart from being more reliable and less frustrating i think the learner can really get more out of it	1
to be honest there are no techniques here that cannot be found in many other places the only difference is that they explain the science behind the techniques which in terms of practical application is not very useful at all	0
a lot of theoretical stuff nothing for practice awful final exam strategy the course encourages learning by heart without any thinking advice to help non english students like me make the lectures not overlapping the subtitles	0
the course doesnt feel complete the information and techniques used for assignments can be found completely online through documentation and instead this is merely an exercise for doing basic analysis through documentation rather than an explanation of python through data science which is what i anticipated	2
the course content is excellent however the english transcript is very poorly done and there are words and sentences are either missing or translated transliterated wrongly a native english language speaker would be great	3
very insightful although very theoretical it is great to create awareness of different strategical concepts and how they are applied but not enough details in how it would actually play out in a real scenario between different entities kept me wanting to learn more though which is a very good thing 	3
i am afraid that this course is to a large extend a marketing tool for promoting the instructors proprietary product its use is therefore limited for the practitioners that want a foundation on the free python dataml capabilitiesi would not recommend this course to my colleagues	1
homework is badly designed it covers too little materials	0
despite being a very interesting topic i did not find this course as enjoyable as others i have done maybe covering these many amount of things in such a short course is too challenging anyhow if you want to learn about india it is a good course however i would recommend the one from the ohio state university the importance of india	2
interesting stuff but not a lot of detail	2
interesting course i learnt a lot	3
very interesting course material however texts are often in such bad english that they are incomprehensible and the staff does not react in the discussion section	1
nice introducing to python	3
i have given you a  star rating as on finishing my course promptly all the information i submitted has suddenly been locked i havent been able to answer a classmates request to review his work  worse i havent been able to print off my own work for reference  this is a real project so i need to be able to do this we were not given notice that this would happendisappointed	1
could have been a bit more challenging but great course none	3
bad course  teaching was poor assignments were very high level but teachings very of low profile	0
i thoroughly enjoyed and benefitted from this course however i also feel there was too much of an emphasis on us policy it is understandable but other than that it was great	3
it was a little long before getting to the really interesting stuff but its a good course for what you pay i wish there were a follow up one like a level i also wish that brian didnt refer to groups of dogs as dog packs as dogs are not pack animals this leads to confusion as dog owners will then believe that they need to be a pack leader and everything that comes with that stereotype i also wish he didnt focus so much on the idea that dogs are from wolves because again many people revert to this is how wolves are so this is how i treat my dog it leads to confusion just read the comments on some threads even while doing this course people were saying how they need to be a pack leader and how they follow what cesar milan doeshowever for those of us that know there is a difference it was interesting to learn more about the differences between wolves and dogs i just wish the course focused more on dogs	2
the teacher was great but i was behind a month just because nobody will grade assigment on week	2
an excellent course dr chuck manages to put various things with ease material as well as teaching is excellent however i found the necessity of having more programming exercises with more difficulty than what course presently offers more exercises with higher difficulty are needed to emphasize the material we have learnt apart from that this is an excellent course	3
week  and  were very useful as a beginner i learned a lot about html and css week  was a big leap to javascript and the level of difficulty was the reason why i quit the course concepts are not wellexplained a lot of material for completing the tasks is missing please make javascript part simple for beginners	0
very practical course keep the good workthanks for your effort	4
best course here in machine learning	4
some problems in quiz part are confusing but nice course in general	3
only a small portion was applicable to my country and school environment	1
i enjoyed taking this mooc very well structured and straight on the points and detailsplenty of practice exercises i recommend	4
i loved this course  very easy to understand i discovered new things i didnt know thank u	3
very good course thank youi wish we could have use case applications with high level tools such as rthanks a lot again 	3
a lot of interesting parts of the course are available as optional and a lot of the difficult parts of the coding exercises are provided to you  the challenge is not there 	2
the course is not updated	0
good basic course if you have no background in finance reviews the important concepts that can get you along easily	3
really useful and interesting courseit surpassed my expectations by far the knowledge and understanding of design thinking and the simplicity that it was presented and connected with agile was truly remarkablewould definitely recommend it	4
not worth your time	0
for pay quiz feedback is not part of the mooc education movement	1
a diff perspective at dig mktg	3
all the guests were women imagen if all the guests had been men	0
way to easy	0
personally speaking the contents are not helpful and the multiplechoice quizzes stuck me a lot	1
week can be explained better first assignment i was clueleass on kintr and how to generate report	2
a fresh perspective to see the relation between wars and our societies the notion that wars are always bad and to be avoided is challenged and seemingly controversial idea of wars bringing benefit to the societies at a cost is discussed quite convincingly	3
good analysis of msw practices in developing countries	3
i do not think some quiz questions are covered in the lectures	2
i love the subjectto be honest for the first glance i didnt bet all my coins in this course but i really got fascinated the teacher indeed explains all the steps required and forth in order to grasp the idea around what is gonna be explained	4
so fresh	4
the doctor speaks so funnylook at his eyeshahahahahahalol	4
i liked the course because of its format and material basically it was comprehensivei did not like the presentation and lack of practical examples i had to force myself to concentrate at times and search other sources for more detailed insight	1
i definitely would recommend more essential books and maybe ted talks as wellgreat books on communication were written by william urygetting to yesgetting to yes with yourself essential bookbeyond reasonhttpswwwamazondegettingyesyourselfworthyopponentsdprefsr__ieutfqidsrkeywordswilliamury	2
good to know more about how to learn	3
too simple	1
she didnt seem interested at all in what she was teaching she had a frown the entire time maybe she was trying to be professional either way i didnt feel like she liked what she was doingthese were good tips for people in a new business management position but honestly this was all stuff you learn while socializing with people they are generally good social skills that every one should have i learned little to nothing while taking this class but as i said most of this is directed towards to someone in a management position i guess this would be helpful when having to work with someone who is a dramamaker although fortunately i have not had a situation yet with someone who creates drama yes i know people who create drama however there have been no blowouts or severe problems maybe this is the reason why i didnt learn anything in this class 	1
this required a lot of work with little gained some questions referring to budgets and site layouts required skills that werent learned in the course the  word feedback comments i got from all reviewers did not feel like worthy responses to the amount of time i put into this project additionally i was graded negatively by some reviewers without reason as happened in other sections overall not really worth the money for a paid certificate would be nice if maybe for the capstone only some sort of professional or professor weighed in on your project for some legitimate and helpful critique	1
the course is good refresher as well as advanced to meet enterprise needs	3
videos are poorly narrated and are marginally effective vocabulary  key concepts only the swirl exercises are woefully inadequate to prepare students for the quizzes foundational tasks ie establishing a valid connection to the sample data are conspicuously absent from the guided exercises leaving too many students to seek help from message boards and google lastly the professors are completely unreachable they may as well be dead after  years in the it industry i found this course to be profoundly aggravating and a complete waste of my time  i have abandoned this course and bought a teach yourself book instead	0
not very much in depth and does not offer complete lecture notes which are necessary for answering the quizzes	1
the course provides a solid structure on which to build academic essays the content of the videos is generally good and seems appropriately targeted but the sample essays are disappointingly trivial and not terribly well written they seem more suited to young high school students rather than wouldbe college level writersthe big issue is in the peer assessment process which forms the centre of the practical experience in the course there is a tremendous time lag apparent between essays being submitted and being reviewed mine took between  and  weeks to get through the process this is obviously an issue for coursera to address as it relates to the platform design rather than the course team but it is nevertheless frustratingthere is a big disconnect between the standards the instructors seem to expect and the assignments submitted the vast majority of students clearly do not have english as a first language and for many writing an academic essay is really some way ahead of their current position perhaps more disturbing is that most of the apparently native english speakers seem not to have taken any notice of either the lectures or the peer grading rubricsdespite the shortcomings in the peer review process the material is well presented and offers a strong framework around which students can build good effective essaysonce again the lack of a forum in this course makes life unnecessarily difficult and frustrating and for me pushes my rating down from a low  to  stars	2
i dont recommend this course to anyonethe course content is not uptothe mark	0
very few o no information about the latin america	2
good introduction to rtos concepts a little theoretical there could have been a project to do in the end which would have made the course objectives more clear	3
this is a great course and a daring venture for what is really an art form beyond its scientific requirements this part of the specialization needs a little refinementi posted this in the discussion forum  days ago  editedfirst of allthese guys running this data science department have their hands full they are teaching live classes for students who have spent oodles lots of money to attend this prestigious college  johns hopkins is about as good as it gets for a medical degree then they are doing experiments and other data science for the research division of johns hopkins which is also as good as it getsthen they are doing these mooc courses on top of all their other responsibilitiesdr leek is a university of washington alumni which is also top notch for data sciencethe video lesson is flawed there is no denying it but i must say these teachers are very open to improvement in the course and your comments on what could be better done are received and acted upon so i would include them in your thank you letter to the teachersalso i think these mooc courses are best done by all members of the department contributing truly this field is a team sport i feel this course was good but the videos need to be edited and scripted so unnecessary language which dilutes the core knowledge that must be learned is not diluted where questions are left in the students head about content when being tested i learned long ago in a college calculus class that if your mark isnt perfect its ok so long as you pass with a high scoreeven if it is the teachers fault the course could use better video production with teleprompter scriptingmaybe some av students at johns hopkins could get on board it will happen eventually im sureyou want to take a course that is absolutely one of the best courses ive taken anywhere and truly the best online try the number one business course on courseragrow to greatness either part  or  university of virginia darden school of businessa team created course with one helluva a teacher who is a business person researcher and awardwinning writer i would recommend this course to any student and especially eteachersthe problem with this course is that there is a lot of information that can be included but may not be absolutely necessary as a core concept needless to say the more technical skills any employee has the more insight they will have into their teammates skills as well as the overall mission of the data department and the business it serves im more of a tech and infrastructure person im not real passionate about coding i find it tedious the more i learn about it the more i enjoy it albeit from a distance i cant see myself creating great blocks of scripts but the more i know about how they are created and what rules the code in a project must abide by the better my skills will be as a data center manager so im trying to learn as much as possible about r python and companion programs like ggvis for creating visualizations id say visualizations are an essential skill for a data manager since you have to present results and projects questions and answers to higher ups and other departmentsthis link comes from the resource section of this coursehttpswwwdatacampcomcoursesggvisdatavisualizationrtutorialthis link or url is of much more value to me than a flawed test question and a reduction in my  percent average in the specializationwithout this lesson in this course i would not have this valuable resourceanother great link which has a great free print publication as wellhttpwwwprocessorcom these people have been advising data center managers longer than just about anybody verbally and in the transcript are some nebulous statements that point toward the main idea that concept being the more any employee on any data science or technical team member is a jack of all trades the better so that could have been included in some more general way on the quiz because really that is pretty much a general rule ive found working in any capacity in the tech industry i have done a great deal of audio editing working at numerous radio stations with adobe audition with others like pro tools or any other really good quality av digital editor the result is streamlined near seamless audiovideo or one or the other you just learn how to read and edit wave forms of all kindsyears ago in dallas texas attending richland college i learned a valuable lesson i was taking a college level calctrig math class being taught by the regular professors wife i dont know if the professor was sick but this woman who was teaching the class for the whole semester frankly was not qualified i had always been considered an illiterate by my high school math teachers a married couple who frankly were highly abnormal even on the geekiest scale these people were acting like they were a world above most people in the class needless to say i assumed by their adult opinions they were sent by god himself to educate me thru denigrationi was amazed how  years later in college math how well i was doing i was carrying a  percent average  so midterm this faux professor declares ill be prefiguring all the arithmetic to be easy so you wont have to bring your calculators so i didntand of course the teachers wife proclaimsi didnt have time to make the arithmetic easy so youd better use your calculators  i literally had pages and pages of figuring in handwriting accompanying my  page test the result was a c plus on the test i angrily told the sub teacher i did not bring a calculator to this test because you said it wouldnt be necessary therefore i must be allowed to redo this test with a calculator  she of course relented no that wont be possiblethats not a bad grade she continued what are you worried about i was so peeved i was going to drop the class it was too late in the semester and i was so disgusted with this womans cavalier dismissal of my perfect grade that i just stopped going to class the result was a failing final gradewho ultimately suffered from this dilemma  that albeit unfairly was mewho created this academic tragedy by the aggravation of a deeply flawed situation once again that would be me	3
really basic with some interesting stuff but could be reduced to a third of the time	1
i like how every week there is an exercise that makes all the difference when it comes to understanding concepts that have been taught	4
very helpful for those who dont know anything about korean language at the first time the methods that are used is easy to follow yet very effective	4
very slow	2
while i appreciate this class for attempting to tackle a complicated topic it was too hard for me to follow and the peer assignment grading rubric is too arbitrary perhaps it is designed for those who are more analytical than myself such as developers i am a writer although i liked the topic i will not be taking more classes with this instructor	1
you cant do the final thing unless you pay so that minuses  stars	2
i have very mixed feelings after completing this course i can hardly say i feel i have learned any valuable stuff especially in contrast to the first course when i had a feeling i am growing with knowledgehere i was able to follow lectures instructions but i did not fully understand why i was doing this and that i believe not enough foundation was given to make people use the galaxy tools consciously the final project was ridiculously far more difficult than what had been covered in the class i truly believe in the idea of giving ambitious final projects but i do not believe in the idea of giving the project that is by no means doable based on the course content very discouraging	1
it was really focused on high level concepts of different technologies the level was really basic no details have been served	0
its a good course with valuable information about storytelling applied for leadership in organizations however dont expect much depth in the classes	2
no practical knowledge learnd and no clear examples of the topics too complex all the course	0
despite being someone with spoken mandarin ability i have decided to stop taking this course due to the new vocabulary not being explicitly described or explained in much detail the basic grammar is also skipped over in explanation	0
this course is not free to submit test results	1
very little real content or information	0
instruction was through watching other characters designers talk about their process	2
purely theoretical i doesnt go deep enough there arent any assignments only a quiz at the end of the week poor material per week	0
fun course that explores why dogs are so special i especially it when dr hare explained the different experiments and their results	4
overall this course was very shallow and only touched the surface on the matters discussed the professors refrained to only mention a few cases of how companies dealt with certain matters rather than provide the tools used in order to reach those decisions also the title of this course barely matches the expectation one has about the content	0
very useful	3
i hate to say it but this course is really really bad  not practical at all im not sure where this is all going maybe by the fourth course in the series  hours later of lectures you might have something practical but this approach feels wrong im sorry its a reputable school and who the hell am i but one mans opinion rethink how you go about introducing the newbie to graphic design as its applicable to the real world	0
inclination was more towards concept than excel	2
it was good and practical	3
this course is pretty good	4
i like this course but for me it was a little bit harder to understand some basic stuff ie in json for me was confusing to hear a list of dictionariesfurthermore i didnt know what kind of operations i need to apply to them  therefore i was checking for types of integers and even brute forcing a combinations of possible operationsas i have finished this course il definitely check again previous chapters to build a better fundamentals in my headthank you dr chuck	4
the course was overall simple and easy to learn the basics of python even you dont have any background experience in programming you can learn az with this course	3
i think this machine learning course quiet challenging although many of concepts are simple but programming in octave matlab  open source version need some dedication	3
the videos are slow and unengaging and way too much text on each slide a few of the assignments have been weird not so good brief and hard to find out how to do it correct and well	1
very poor organized	0
great introduction to machine learning specialization and the various algorithms employed in the different courses in my opinion every specialization should have an introductory course that covers the various different things that will form the focus of each subsequent course so that students do not start the specialization and find out down the line that the specialization is not quite what they expected	3
content is good lectures can be more user friendly	3
excellent panorama of classical musici specially like the lesson about mozart and the dark side of mozart and what was said about the social evolution of the musicians	3
the jump from the lecture material to the assignments was way too much in order to complete the assignments one needs to spend lots of time learning things not covered in the course	0
the weeks  and  are really good the weeks  and  are going to fast and the things that are teached are not connectes with each other well so its impossible to do the assignment  and assignment  has nothing to do with what is tought in week 	1
awesome course and strongloop is fantastic	4
very good course got a lot of useful insights  quizzes are fine and just right amount but needs more challenging lab exercises for practice	3
really helpful 	4
helps me a lot understand how to organize knowledge and study better thank you very much	2
a very interesting course with the material given in a simple and clear way for everyone to understand	3
it is very basic course just giving the introduction to a layman	0
all talking dont even have slides to assist with the presentation of materials also seemed to have focused too much on the european unionconvention instead of the common law itself	1
there could be more work in the assignments in this course the quizzes are very simple	2
the course is much too easy to my mind some more practical exercises or more readings in fundamentals could be a nice addition	2
brilliant  masterclass  this course will definitely full up all my needs about wind energy	4
this course offered many interesting ideas about flipping school classrooms but offered no suggestions about the practical methods to do so as a teacher i need to have realistic suggestions about the technology necessary to flip my math class not a series of testimonials about how great its going to be once my class is flipped	0
full of helpful tips and suggestions	3
good course for basic information about digital analytics	2
one of the best courses ive ever had online	4
great course	3
this was an excellent introduction to html and i liked the emphasis on accessibility	4
the course is really well explained and skills obtained are quite valuable in the labor market	3
the course is well structured with clear objective for each lecture it starts by asking the main question about the course then summarize the answer and the key messagespractice and assignment are valuable to apply and test courses knowledgethank you	3
great course but module  lacks a bit in structure hard to follow without the forum it would not be possible to make it in time	2
excellent overview of plotting and clustering however there were a few bits that were required for good completion of the projects that werent covered in detail overall an excellent course and specialization	2
is a good course because have a resumed content with a practical view and usability in real world	4
the assignments seemed somewhat easy compared to curriculum which became more difficult i would say that the assignments from the first course were more challenging then those from the second i also think very little attention was paid to new monad constructs like try validate and scalas reactive library but i guess the later was left for the third course	3
for a beginner like me this course was a good introduction i really liked the interviews of the earlier students who are now working in different role in different companies that gave me a good insight about the working world in this field	3
the instructor is sub par questions are a bit vague	2
not worth the price extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just to be able to charge for it	0
very informative and learning experience this is first time i have attended any online course this course and coaches in the course explained things so nicely that i felt it like sitting in a class room entire team deserves a big applaud for conducting such a nice sessioncourse content was nicely designed and brilliantly explained its really worth appearing in this coursethank you uc san diego 	4
outdated and the guy is really hard to listen to for hours	1
didnt think that this is the best course for people who want to learn about digital marketing the learning process is very slow and sometimes i felt that more could be learnt by just reading a number of books or articles on this topicthere is no dialogue with the professor or anyone who has more experience or knowledge the assignments are checked by people who are also taking this course though one would expect to learn from the assignments and mistakes he or she makes during it instead some people who have ideas maybe even wrong ones about this specific area of knowledge judge your work i could be also wrong about those things and have to grade somebodys work which is a bit confusingbesides the assignments are not very interesting or challenging i wouldnt recommend passing this course	0
interesting stuff and quite comprehensive however the programming assignments on a fill here basis does not really lead to a generalization of the required algorithms to perform ml	3
the lecturer is very good the course is not very insightful and on the surface it is business oriented it doesnt deal with interesting and challenging academic problems	1
not done with the course yet but i have to say it started out very well and organized i was actually learning how to use excel in the first week while the instructor was teaching the later weeks however seem to be completely different theyre disorganized and im struggling to see how the material correlates its as if im being bombarded with random topics in addition to the fact that the instructor literally stops using excel to teach after week  lessons are just random notes on a blackboard with a link at the end to the excel sheet in which the instructor has already prepared before with a lot of info that you need familiarize yourself with solo i had high hopes when i was done with the first week but now i have to say im bored and demotivated so far	0
thinks its a cool coursebut am getting it getting the concepts of the functions probably needs lots of practicewish u all the best	1
i tried giving zero stars this course is very poor in particular the last portion of the class wherein you are tested on things that were not taught if i had wanted to spend hours in google trying to learn this stuff i would not have spent money on this course	0
a very fun and interesting course it was challenging i learnt a lot from this course it is the best course a person could ask for it was really interesting i will remember genomics decoding the language of life forever	4
amazing course really excited to choose it	4
this course has a lots of knownledge and wellstructured contents	3
too easy for accessing web data with many bonus	3
is a good introduction	4
excellent course that gives enough to understand a lot of interesting dna related algorithms great instructor	4
good introduction	3
a great course to understand the procedure for nonmedicos	2
very good intro to r programming	4
this course was incredibly interesting and informative even for an introduction class the layout made a lot of sense even for someone with only a little bit of experience in typography definitely do all of the assignments because they have been planned out with a lot of care and thought to further your understanding in the topic	4
i joined to learn outstanding experience but  disappointed	1
helpful ideas but could use some more practical suggestions	2
this is rd time i a trying this course labeling someone just reading the slides out loud as a course is ridiculous i have to express that this is horrible please dont callout a course call it audio slidesi have a masters degree in engineering and have won scholarship all my life this is the first time i am trying out online course the courses were okay till i came to this sections mostly done by brian jaffe knowing and teaching is two different things brian i will continue with help from other materials outside the course but i have ti rate this as  star	0
the course did not continue as it was in its part	3
even though this course covers a lot fundamentals for introduction to algorithm the course itself is not designed as good as i expected for starters the weekly problem designs arent very good some problem statements are ambiguous and not very clear unless you read more than one time or take a closer look at the examples often the input formatarguments are designed to take redundant info some problem even has more than one possible correct outputs which is just confusing for learning purposein terms of lecture videos its good that there are some classic algorithm problems being demonstrated in the video however the linkage between how to express a problem in mathematical languages is poorly explained for example in the lecture of edit distance the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all i personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures however i personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience i also understand that its more difficult to explain proving steps considering the large variety of audience i would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more indepth knowledge into optional videos in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better overall i know that talking and analyzing algorithms can be kinda of boring and challenging but i wish the course videos could be stated in a more interesting and intriguing way	1
very enjoyable course however i think that it would have been nice to have some more professional viewing of our work since several of us were taking in this information for the first time	3
except the fact that it was taught well i believe that pressuring people work with a specific program to pass a course is not helpful i believe that instead of learning how to handle pro tools from scratch you should change the course to something more creative like recording different instruments measuring the studio space monitors and much more helpful things than advertise and make avid richerfriendlyall the best	0
i was unable to complete my session due to time bound and my busy schedule	4
i have taken the noncertification course of machine leaning by dr andrew ng the material covered is this course is adequate and very insightful in my opinion this course should be a start point for any individual who want to learn machine learning this course provides all the necessary fundamentals with a little bit of math that gives an intuitive sense of the algorithms i would gladly recommend this course	4
professor dinhams investigative and research based approach is great and in my opinion much needed in the professional educational community worldwidely the material is presented thoroughly and the second piece of peerassesed assignment is pretty well explainedhowever i think the course material proposed in the outlines should be more diverse by adding complementary video lectures research articles and book extracts in every week since this was proposed in this way just in fifth week course  of the specialization program is a great example of thatthe first piece of peerassessed assignment may improve by being clearer and giving the opportunity to the learner to express hisher own ideas instead of request a summary from this multiple choice questions should follow the principles exposed in the th course of the specialization program which seems to not be done at all forums prompts should be shorter and clearer by highlighting a single key question instead of a bunch of these as happened	1
the lecturer is clear but there is a problem with the pasteit is much too slow he states the obvious too often talks very slowly and that makes it hard to stay focused	1
the app is neat but too short	2
dry material and the second professor was	1
overview with key terminology and process information good introduction andor refresher	2
this is a nice practical course	3
videos are fastpaced material is limited no real slides or extensive doc exercises are sometimes not clear in their statement activity on the forum compensates that exercises are however close to challenges you face in real life finally the start date was delayed and there is no clear visibility on when the other modules are started so the course could be better given provide more material and be better coordinated i followed one python course at rice university which was by far better given	1
the course itself is exceptional instructor elaborates everything perfectly but it takes really longer time to receive peerreviews to pass the course also course doesnt have any forums where students can post that they need peerreviews which can be helpful to finish the course in timely manner	3
a good clear examination of basic punctuation and grammar the lectures are well presented and the exercises useful the element which really doesnt work is the peer assessment or review this seems intended to replace forum discussions but it is not a good substitute and there are no forums	2
easy to follow might be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis however the instructors also talk about some frameworks and insights from their experience which could be helpful even for those who have some prior experience	3
great course the professor is very knowledgeable and the materials are up to date with the current industry trends i was able to apply the concepts learnt in this course in my job	4
this course has really helped to improve some aspects of my sentence structures and punctuation in addition the classes are well organized the material is clear and most all the professors are really good	4
thanks for making things simpler	4
this course doesnt help much	1
again i wish the teachers would explain explicitly what is needed for the programming exercise i felt abandoned by the faculty when i was trying to work out the programming exercise there is an assumption that we as students know what the teachers are talking about	1
thanks i enjoyed the course and learn a lot in it	4
great course	4
interesting statistical concepts and great theory however the lectures and the quizzes do not prepare the student well for the final project	0
this was very disappointing especially considering its a wharton product the course was little more than an afternoons worth of seminars since i am not a paying participant i could not take the quizzes so i finished watching the videos in less than a dayin addition there are no collateral or supporting materials provided none of the spreadsheets or workbooks illustrated in the videos are available anywhere on the course site despite their being advertised in the videos all in all it was consistent with the first course in this specializationagain very disappointing im glad i didnt spend any money on this	0
this is the fourth class ive taken in the creative writing specialization program as a whole i enjoyed the class with only a few notes to make as with the other classes in the specialization i feel the curriculum could be expanded upon perhaps with assigned readings to help illustrate the points made in the lectures another thing i wish to note albeit a minor one is that the videos in this course particularly feel a bit cut up it seems like several takes were combined into one video which makes the overall presentation feel a bit jerky in comparison to other courses in the program	3
nice course ive learnt a lot thank you david	4
good the video lectures cover a nice variety of topics giving you a good introduction of journalism ethics and other important considerations for becoming a journalistbad the entire course feels hastily put together some of the videos have summarizing points which is helpful when taking notes but they flash on the screen briefly then cut to a closeup of the lecturer then cut back to the summery points so quickly that you cant copy them down and it becomes super distractingthe quizzes are a joke they usually consist of  questions with two answers each and once choice so outrageous that they dont take any thought at all to complete you could just skip to the quizzes without watching a single lecture and ace them easilythe assignments are also a joke they ask for  sentence answers max some of them ask you to use more than one word to respond ive taken free courses on here than involve  word essays and then at least youre forced to process the information in the lectures you can pass this course without watching a single lecture and thats a travesty to michigan stateit is full of typos and oversights that could have been avoided if they had once person run through the course as a quality control one of the quizzes has the answer included right beneath the question as a typo the simple assignments are described in  different places sometimes with conflicting instructions they tell you what to do and how to review your peers in one section and then the actually assignment has different instructions on what to do than the page prior so you end up unsure of what the assignment actually wants you to do for example the final assignment at firsts asks you how to engage with your audience and then you click next and the same question is now asking you how you distribute content did they even tryin summery the content in the lectures are a good but shallow overview of journalism but dont expect to be challenged to do anything but fill in ovals and regurgitate questionsnot too much to learn here	1
this course is ok for introduction if youre not already familiar with the iot devices and embedded systems but if you already have done some projects in iot and embedded systems and are familiar with what they are then you dont need this course this course is designed for a complete beginner who doesnt have any idea what iot and embedded systems are and now that youre researching about a course on iot you probably have an idea what they are and as a guy who had already done some projects in this area in undergrad i found the content to be very simple and lacking any new things to add to my knowledge but if you are a complete beginner then go for it	2
really good and comprehensively researched course	4
i loved this course it helped me very much and im grateful for everything i learned herethe only thing i think need to be improved is the evaluation systemcant wait for my next course	3
excellent high level introductory course at a very affordable price the material is very accessible and pragmatic for a basic programmer but still alludes to the very complex theory behind the algorithms i highly suggest reading the pdf course notes if you want more of the theory	3
i think its useless spending that amount of time explaining this basics it is not worth it id rather go deeper in angularjs nodejs or ionic after all this is a course for a mid level so you should go to another course to take the basics and here a more advanced level	0
i really like the course however it was too short and generic and writing a memo as a repetation of the course was not that exhilaratingi havent used the discussion forums too much however i was expecting more on building business modelsprobably it will be the subject of the next package but still  courses were too little as coveragei really liked the alagories and interviews from real life experiences and thank you for the effort	1
boring assignments	1
this course is very good for children	2
great intro to python	4
good course a little simple suitable for people who dont have programming background	4
just garbage this course and its twin introduction to smart iot devices are an expression of imposture at high level fortunately the other courses in eit digital series are very interesting	0
this is a very good course to get familiar with ibm watson iot platform the course is well structured since i was new to node js i had some difficulty but the instructors helped a lot  thanks to ibm and coursera	4
great course awesome introduction in order to learn basic concepts of web development	4
need more hands on activities	2
an amazing course to help debunk a lot of myth provide you with a lot of simple and effective study tipsthe videos the instructors both are very amazing i am happy i took this course and i hope it will benefit me in my future learning experiences	3
great and free	1
i enrolled the course expecting a little more vision on how to read a photograph a composition although thanks to the curator i now understood that the context time environment history  is important to that purposei appreciated the competence with which she treated each subject and the interesting perspective given to the various modules it gave me a new viewpoint in what photography really isgood videos and interviews made it easier to understandsome readings from the required and additional resources were difficult because of the conceptsi personally found some topics module  and  a bit abstract and difficult to follow but i put myself into it to expand my knowledge and open my mind	3
wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesdifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion the discussion forum does not work as intended there is too much noisethey course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated it all seems rushed and not rewardingi do not think that my outcome of this course has been significant because of the structure of the course and i regret that i have paid for all  courses	1
it is wonderful for a beginner who knows nothing about programming if you know programming of any other languages you can spend a few hours and quickly finish this course	2
i wish there were another conflict specialization on coursera to choose from one that is more modern up to date interesting engaging less patronizing  etc but there isnt so i guess were all stuck with this one need i say more	2
this class was a great introduction to machine learning ideas and implementation prof ng does a really good job of not only showing you how to code up machine learning examples in matlaboctave but explaining the rationale behind them if machine learning is as much an art as a science then this is the artistic part which is hard to find in a textbookhowever i do kind of wish we had covered fewer topics but in more detail mind you im biased because i was a math major and want to see proofs for everything but i would have really liked to see more of the details behind support vector machines and neural networks if youre looking for that kind of thing then its probably best to do additional reading on your ownanyway i still gave this class five stars because i have been searching for an introduction to machine learning that could give me a broad perspective and share some wisdom of expertise for a while now i found it in andrew ngs machine learning class on coursera	4
great course delineating all the fundamental principles some parts of it maybe a bit too easy for people with decent linear algebra knowledge but definitely a comprehensive and worthwhile introduction in the exciting topic of machine learning im definitely motivated to learn more 	3
the project at the end requires actions that data scientists should know but does not actually talk about the items for example the project book you hear about it but are not actually taught the right way to make one at best case you are taking a guess and at worst you are learning bad habits or missing out on what should be in it	1
great course	4
nothing much to learn the videos were rather short theres no lecture on computing the angles and the full features of the framework the framework wasnt updated for swift 	0
the most terrible course i have ever seen in my life and on this site for some of quiz questions you feel like you are dumb because you can not make connection between lectures and quizzes i really wanted to learn java on coursera but it seems impossible to me focusing on rbg values and image thingies too much and making me feel uncomfortable at quizzes after watching all those lectures are the main reasons of giving  star	0
thank you	4
i found the course interesting though the continual music being played in the background was a distraction for me and felt like a brainwashing exercise	2
i am very excited that i become a programmer and ihope that in the end of this course i become like a professional programer	2
the course itself is good nevertheless it says that it doesnt require any previous experience but there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts	2
awesome i am in the th week of this course but would like it to go on  on how subtly  effectively prof raghunathan shows us what we do and how effectively  scientifically we can make changes in our life approach to lead much better life  to be really happy  fulfilled only saying great work would be too littlethanks so much	4
this course has great videos i give it such a low rating to get your attention and point out some serious problems this is a certification course in how to teach english as a second language what was not apparent to me though is that you have to take  parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year also there is close to no teacher participation in the module i took and there are no mentors or student teachers that might change in future classes i would hope but no guarantees and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback even the peer reviews require your classmates only to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that i cant even remember now no one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous english but that is not to be considered with so many people taking this course for whom english is not a first language even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments also even though the videos are really welldone they are short and contain little information for the price i figured that i was paying about  an hour for the lectures at regular speed there are also little to no resource links etc for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get if you are a native english speaker who doesnt mind spending an entire year and the cost for welldone videos on the subject is not important then this course if for you if however you think this is going to cost only  and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year i want to make sure you realize that is not what this specialization is if you are not a native english speaker this course is designed well i think for people who do not speak english as a native language who might even have a low level of english yet who are teaching english already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore dont mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset i have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of english but as a native speaker i found it slow expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying its perfect though for my foreigner friends as long as they understand its real length and cost the certification will take over a year and cost around 	0
though it is a nice introduction i would have expect a more syntax learning lessons	2
very poor presentation and content difficult to navigate and all the links used including that for galaxy are outdated there was no effort made to provide a method to get through the course given all the changes since the videos were recorded this course is the reason i have decided not to pursue the specialization it falls under	0
some concepts need more clarification elaborations	3
this course is a pure advertisement for ibm products i entered the course expecting to learn about raspberry pi and python and got nothing our of it if you are really looking to learn about iot check out a course called  an introduction to programming iot by university of california irvine i am taking this course right now and already learning a ton this course on the other hand is a total waste of time	0
although the course was very useful i couldnt complete the course due to an assignment the assignment is very unrealistic and the graders dont give any feedback the assignment is open ended question and not difficult but took significant time when i submit i was unable to pass	0
very vague abstract ideas in the lectures would be much better if more reallife examples and scenarios were used in the lectures to convey those abstract ideas	1
not worth it	0
poor content only a book accompanies the videos and we should not be forced to buy anything	0
very basic but thats the point a good review of the capabilities of spreadsheets for simulating scenarios with a probabilistic mindset	4
the videos lag behind and the readings the first one of the first week the link was broken	0
so far very good very clear explanations	4
awesome learning experience the interactive way of teaching by respective professor tobias kretschmer has created great curiosity the examples discussed are highly relevant and laymen for freshers definitely going for next advanced course enjoyed the learning game theory	3
unfortunately on the whole i was very disappointed with this class i took the first two python courses and found them manageable but this third one was an unrealistic increase in difficulty from the previous two i reached out for help on the discussion board a number of times and saw many others were struggling as well mentors who responded to some of the other students were clearly getting defensive when those students were getting nowhere on the assignments i think this program should reevaluate itself so students such as me can keep up with the assignments on average i was spending about  hours per week just on the syntax for building the programsa little about my background i have  years of experience in the private sector and am currently an analyst in cyber security i have an undergraduate degree in finance an mba and another masters degree in data analytics this  course program has been described and sold as beginner level and given my background i should have handily been able to complete it but that was definitely not the case normally i dont leave feedback unless i feel strongly about something so i hope you take it seriously thanks	0
best for understanding the basics 	3
very good course for intermediate and professionals	3
great course for those dont have programming experience	3
some course content are not updated links not working very few people in discussions didnt see tas i had some questions on the forum but not answered	2
videos way too short annoying musicanimations lots of stereotypes floating s and s reallythis doesnt seem like a serious course provided by a university	0
this couldve been better but i understand that you want to minimize time of videos but at the end it lacks many information about delegates and protocols and so on	2
great course wouldve rated  except for the use of matlaboctave	3
was expecting more of the how tos and a bit of programming or at least concepts of the programmingstatistics but i guess there are different interpretations of the idea of a crash coursedefinitely geared for people who work with data scientists but not in the data science field	2
the course is quite good but it if you already have some knowledge about the subject and want to go deeper in it this is probably not your course	3
pretty good course for beginners	2
this course can give you hands on advice on how to manage a sprint that solve a design issue for my taste most of the information is far too specific and tied to one scenario its ok to present a detailed schedule with a number of minutes for breaks its also ok to assume a certain mind set for your manager however i am missing the occasional birds eye view like how did we come to these conclusions and where do other team leads maybe from different cultures vary from these rules in conclusion i would recommend the agile course from alberta university instead	1
great i learn how to manage the pmbook	3
lectures were interesting and well put together however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material while i can appreciate that every course will require some elements of selflearning and exploration this felt a step too far my sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate you will be fine however if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics you are going to have to work very hard im hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization	2
very good course and handson experience for non experts thanks	3
i find this to be a very nice and stimulating course the teachers are enthusiastic and entertaining the course material slides quizzes captions needs to be polished but the general organization of the course is logical clear and systematic the course presents an experimentalists view of the subject which i find very good considering that much related coursera material is quite theoretical there are plenty of historical notes and introductions of general neurobiology research viewpoints dont miss the excellent bonus material interviews in particular i enjoyed the cherry picking metaphor some students have had problems with the instructors accent but perhaps because english is not my first language this has not been a problem for me at all im looking forward to part two of the course	3
difficult but a challenging course	4
a very simplistic and chaotic course explanations are all over the placebluej is probably the worst ide i have ever seen and i have been a programmer for about  yearsthere are far better courses i would not recommend this course at all	0
excellent course maybe a bit more exercises or at least links to sources would make it more useful	3
i think that this course was too basic	1
not for the basic student looking for information very detailed	0
very low quality and not practical	0
nice introduction to python but might be a bot too basis for those already familiar with python	3
too high level	1
very useful	2
fundamental insights into what makes businesses excel	4
interesting but basic course mostly a series of tips on how to take advantage of human susceptibility to persuasion the last week concerning how to resist attempts to manipulate you was probably the most important	2
actually a great class on a topic that is highly relevant in theory and practice alike the problem of this class is mostly one assignment the statement of problem set  is very unclear while the feedback from the grader is too little to improve anything forum didnt help either despite my arguably strong technical background i had to give up at this point since i simply cannot invest arbitrary amounts of time too bad for the rest of the course which i was looking forward to a lot	1
taught very quickly and assumes a high degree of math fluency only take this if you are either very fluent in math already or have a significant amount of time to devote to understanding the material	1
interesting	4
this course disappointed me i expected to receive knowledge about negotiation but its more advertisement for the book i did every step in the course until the quiz and the quiz asks for knowledge which wasnt in the course i assume that i should have read the book to be prepared to do the quiz thats not why i registered on coursera	0
great course only thing is answers to teradata exercises were not provided so student cannot know whether he is writing correct sql statements	3
good course easy to follow stayed away from complicated deepdives of information	2
i am relatively experienced programmer trying to just understand the android app development framework and solve some interesting challenges along the way i feel the course was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other peoples workif i were to break up the time i spent doing the course work it would be as follows  useful work  taking care of course logistics code review writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy why do we have to do so many code reviews not every assignment requires peoples coding style to be evaluated it places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated we should be learning about android for  more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for  more hoursthe thing i found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone since i am an experienced programmer i understand the importance of coding style creating functions and all that however how i structure my code and how many comments i write are entirely my choicenow while i understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done its a subtle form of style enforcement which i did not appreciate	1
brilliant material about product management in a nutshell	4
it is very easy and somehow less impacting on real business problem i hope this microdegree will get into some kind of complexity otherwise will remain high school level	1
a very interesting and clearly presented course i would recommend this course anyone who is interested in the study of biodiversity	3
starting from scrach an then coming onto its concepts great learning	3
coordination is required between the lectures and the assignments so a to fill any gaps	2
she just started with wk  there should have been more explanation and videos in week not very interesting i think statistics you need to take in person	1
vastly concerned with the esoteric minutia ideas and meanings assigned by others regarding photographs which most often arent even closely aligned with the original artists intentionsa brief few mentions of how photography has changed over time with advances in technology and development of new techniques was mildly interesting otherwise this course was predominantly meaningless this course will most likely be of no benefit to people not viewing or creating fine art photography	1
highly interesting i do recommend the coursethank you alex	3
very nice course i learned new things thanks for the coursera team and community	4
i liked it although i felt like they were  courses one for the first three weeks another one during the last weekthe first course was ok but it was regular accounting stuff i was rusty on that so i enjoyed itthe second course was the one related with analyticsi give it  stars because you can see some lack of preparation in the team and because didnt made a proper link between accounting and analytics	2
the content is too basic and both lectures are too boring	1
this is a really wonderful coursegratitude to andrew ng for his efforts	4
the teacher is great and the subject is very interesting	3
after the first two introductions the course was not for me	1
the only downside of this course is absence of certificate everything else is extremely great	3
it was an enlightening experience	3
excellent course especially in understanding the gas politics in europe i would recommend that more ephasis is given on the politics of oil as well	4
really interesting course the teacher keep it cool and interactive looking forward to complete the specializationjan	4
lecturer is too boring and volume is too low	1
it is a good introduction to the data scientist tools and processes	3
backed with research presented clearly and artfully it is both helpful and enjoyable  kudos	4
i have learned few very efficient strategies to improve my work productivity and balance my worklife time really like the concept of supporting ourselves through the change highly recommend anyone who wants to improve their time management	3
the assignments were good but it was a lot of time spent with the grader	2
useful preparation for hr especially for the united states	3
i have learnt some basic knowledge about dogs congnition it may be more interesting if i have a dog to take part in these experments	2
this course provides its participants with an incredible tool to solve critical situations in the work place and in the private life	4
inconsitencies in instructions and information for some assignments otherwise very good	3
the difficulty level of this course is very inconsistent the first project stack smashing was difficult at least for me but i could complete it with the information taught in the lectures i was unable to complete the second project badstorenet which requires a knowledge of html and sql that is not taught in the course the third project fuzzing and symbolic execution was a joke type this and tell us what you see my advice is if you are a novice take the free course first to see if you can complete it then if you really need the certificate pay and retake the course	1
yes therere some pronunciation tips and situational conversation practice to help you get started but in speaking of helping students to become a professional english speaker i think the course still has a long way to go	2
i like the content and enjoyed the process but as this is online course it should be better designed the criteria for reviews and assignment direction is probably not too explicit that cause a lot of confusion and people are submitting very different assignments from one another it is not easy to grade and hard to understand what is expected also it is recommended that you know adobe illustrator or indesign i actually had to take additional course alongside of this course because although it was not mandatory it was better to know how to use these software	2
i liked a lot but im still to learning	2
the course is pretty basic however i think its necessary to start with good base for the rest of the specialization courses	2
very interesting course well organized thank you	4
dr peng is great at teaching and the lectures are not hard to follow the recommended ebook is almost a transcript of the lectures examples and i really recommend getting it i got it on print as i like to make annotations while following the videosthat being said the programming assignments are extremely difficult for anyone with no programming background the assignments do not require just what is being taught and demands a lot of google and stack overflow research in order to solve the problems if you are doing other coursera courses andor working at the same time i recommend you invest time in this and do not let the assignments for the weekends	2
the instructor rambled on when back on forth on topics and numbers too much and made the videos much longer than they needed to be some of the information is badly outdated like the electric vehicle driving range and hybrid vehicles only able to drive a mile with ou	0
love it  very interesting	4
good course o professional grooming	3
if i am auditing this class why cant the quizzes be free alsowhat happened to free coursera	0
i enjoy the prof style to explain complex concept in a simple mode	4
this course was extremely valuable to me theoretical knowledge especially my two points for possible improvement most probably subjective would bethe course is too slowpaced there is a bit too much of an auxiliary talk which may distract from the essential knowledgewhile the course offers some state of the art practical examples a little more interactive approach would probably immensely increase student involvement and hence help keep attention and distinguish important pointslastly at every start of the week i was asked to do a test quiz to asses my knowledge from that week this is very strange the test quizzes should most definitely be offered only in the end of a week after i have acquired knowledge and not before	3
the course is well done and well structured however its too theoretical	1
not enough implication from the instructors in the course students are left alone with the material without any answers to there questions on the coursepeer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the studentsthats quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that	1
overall good course but the course instructors should made the slides for the lectures available it would be very important with the capstone course coming soon and having the need to review all courses that the slides for all courses cold be made available wharton illinois yale make the slides available in their top tier courses and it is very important	3
it would be better if the instructors cared to respond to queries	0
very well done course	3
could not understand many of the mathematical formulae involved the topic coverage was good	1
the assignments were not challenging enough	1
the course is good enough to learn a few concepts about techniques to improve the learning process four hours per week is all you will need to finish it with good grades great work	2
too basic the  courses of this specialization could be just one course	1
the class was a helpful intro to pandas but it was not as much a class as it was a series of homework assignments and the student painstakingly looking things up on stackoverflow in the end i am positive i got the correct answers using a horrible coding method and will never see the correct solutions there should be a little bit more handholding in order for the student to learn the concepts otherwise i might just throw a class up on coursera give the link to docspythonorg tell the students to read it and then they will be experts at python	1
the course has a fundamental problem it relies completely on a library developed by one of the instructors which is not open source in the end it seems like a big opportunity of delivering a marketing campaign by the instructors then otherwisei definitely will not spend time and money on the other courses of this specialization	0
title misleading never ever a beginners course	0
very good introduction to python and good challenges in the work exercises	4
i was exceptionally pleased with this class the workload was about right to really get you thinking in r	4
this course is one of the few lesser courses ive seen on coursera since the course instructor has shown little commitment to course material preparation compared to other course instructors he reads off the bullet points on the powerpoint slides without any elaboration this seems to be part of an introductory specialization to emerging technologies yet merely stating keywords without explaining them makes the learning process very difficult for learners new to the fields with the video lecture length totaling at  hours this course clearly needs to have more materials a learner should not be tricked into paying  for an  hour reading of powerpoint slidesi have watched a few video lectures of the other courses in this specialization and the presentation of material reflects problems aforementionedplease considerably improve this course or remove this specialization from course catalog its not fair for us learners and other course providers who want to revolutionize online learning experience	0
the course is good but it could be improved for example i dont think the images on the background even if they are stunning are particularly important and i think they could be substituted by plots and schemes referring to the topics all the presented schemes where helpful but there would have been more things that would have been good to see visually	1
not up to the standard of the previous two courses the material was already covered in the first course  fundamentals of graphic design  and nothing new was brought to the table even the assignments were a rehash of the ones from the first course i realize the point of the lack of specific guidance was intended to encourage us to explore the making of multiple iterations of the images i just would have liked to have more instruction or examples of the elements of composition hierarchy	1
very very basic course learned about html css in initial classes then it was completely javascript but there was no details about how to use javascript for web programming projects and quizzes are kind of ok difficultyi will recommend this course for the people who are not aware of programming	1
the course is very much understandable each module is explained clearly and prerequisite knowledge of some concepts helps in getting good grades thanks for the financial aid i would like to continue the mechanics of materials ii	4
great explanations provided by prof waterman however for the price of this course in my view quite expensive the materials available are quite poor eg the formulas shown in the pdf slides are a mess not a mathematical summary etc and the level of the quizzes is very basic i would have expected much more from a course coming from whaton	1
i submitted homework for week  i get an email telling me i did not submit then week two the course makes references to material not covered in week  it looks like a week is missing between week  and week 	0
while there is some interesting content particuarly in the last week on design thinking some of the course topics dont seem to hold together well and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads while this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally if youre not watching you miss the questions i would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for d printing with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lions share of the course i believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice	1
well explained and practical	4
too much of common sense stuff and not much in the way of advanced techniques	1
i have no complaints over the content i would however change the final quizzes which rely too much on one essay rather than on the videos or on other reading material	2
very basic course not too challenging to a nonamerican	2
too short	1
it was a very theoretic coursei would have enjoyed it more if more real life examples were compared with all the theoryat some points i found it too tedious even though i found marketing an interesting subject i have to say that the last  weeks i found it really hard to pay attention and follow the classways to improve it more real life examples and more visual explanations	2
nice primer for modeling but wish there were more workable problems to help hit the point home	2
this course is terrible for many reasons firstly the amount of content is ridiculously small  only about  minutes of video lectures per week moreover more than  of content is just nonrelevantsecondly practical assignments are very poorly planned in weeks  peer graded assignment students are asked to save tableau workbooks as twbx files even though this feature is not supported by tableau public that is used in this course the assignment itself is just opening and saving file in tableau in weeks  peer graded assignment you just asked to write some vaguely defined  page description it doesnt include any tableaurelated activitiesthirdly quizzes are ambiguous and very generaloverall this course is just a waste of time for comparison you can easily get more useful information about tableau from the  minute long getting started video on the tableau website than from this course just wonder how coursera allows such courses to be places on the platform	0
understandable and enjoyable i took home a lot of valuable inforrmation from this course	4
the instructor is very energetic and the case studies teaches valuable lessons	3
while this course is well organized and descriptive it barely touches the internet of things technologies	2
this course is good to improve the listening skills but the note taking is really boring because it is focused in only one method the conell note this disregards individual differences and i dont think this method is the best for me	0
prepare to learn some of the most powerful study techniques ever researched by neuroscience	4
i really enjoyed the intellectual challenge of the course but i was a little bit disappointed by the set of problems for homework  in my view the whole set should be reviewed in order to make	3
for a developing manager this has some great insight to help you work to become a great manager in this changing environment	3
not good as usual one the code you provided can not work i had to debug againand the instructions for the assignments are not concrete as the last two courses	0
its great course for starter as well as to gain advanced knowledge around ml excellent explanation and assignment to make concepts more concrete	4
its a quiet complex topic in general terms it is well covered but in my opinion there should be at least an exercise per video explaining something similar to the invideo questions it should have a demonstrative part rather than just talking about it and showing the formula	3
content is interesting but the lectures and the content is far below the first course in the series in my opinion	2
i thing this course should have one or two more modules its definitely to short to grasp the basics of javascript for complete beginners it should start with a module about foundations of programming and after explain in depth what is a method a property an event a calculation a variable an object etc after i finished all the modules of this course always coding along the lectures and having done all the assignments to practice and having read the extra material by the end of this course i didnt had a solid foundation about how to program in javascript so if you enrolled the web design specialization after the html  csss courses you will have solid foundation about those languages you will also grasp the basics of responsive design course but you will have to do other javascript courses to became a junior frontend developer in the real life	1
disappointing the material is presented in such a way that it neither suits the mathematically inclined nor those interested a more handson introduction to neural networks some quizzes miss important figures and explanations so that they can only be solved with the help of other students that have access to previous versions of the courseif this course should run for another session the provider university of toronto should decide on the proper audience and should also considerably revise the course given the flaws with the current session it seems that the provider just wants to reap some easy money from students attracted by a current and interesting topic an a wellknown name geoffrey hinton	1
course lacks wider and real sociopolitical context of the xix and xx century central and eastern europe additionally it is full of statements that are not supported by the historical facts	0
very useful for online learner	4
the quality of the lectures and teaching was the lowest i have ever seen on coursera i wanted to do the whole specialty but after this first one i was so disappointed that i will stop the assignments were overly complicated and demanding for no real reason i have used coursera for years and this is the first time i have wanted a refund	0
not the best course of the serie it is a pity because i had great expectation in this course	1
dear courserathis was my first coursera course at all the course is in general is interesting and it give a good theoretical approach and examples how to turn this theory in practicethe discussion possibility is also very useful learning from your classmates is great the discussions are respectfull and if somebody has a different opinion or view this is seen as added value and is not judged negativelythe only thing missing is the possibility to have live and direct conversation with the teachers i did a training where we had the opportunity for one hour to ask questions in a chat and the teacher was answering them in a live webinar that was really usefull and would make it a five star courseoverall i would attendtake a coursera training any time again great plattform	3
very practical introduction to bioinformatics tools from a biological perspective labs were excellent and the quizzes were mostly welldesigned only downside is that some required softwareweb tools are difficult to run on linux but thats unavoidable given the field	4
interesting subjects to chose from also nice and short format of the assignment	3
the lectures are fairly light and there are no assignments throughout the course to reinforce the material mostly they just introduce a few concepts then point you at the apple swift documentation they really dont go into much detailthe final assignment is good for getting your feet wet but is poorly specified	1
a bit basicslow to start with covers fundamentals very well and the textbook is excellentsome of the slides are hard to read  the white text on fluorescent green particularly	2
the quiz and assignment are poorly designed important issues are overlooked or just briefly discussed in lecture the assignment focuses on matlab coding which only emphasizes the coding technique do not recommend to audience with	0
i did all four courses  the whole specialization each course in itself was aright and i learned new things however the course certificate is meaningless it neither states the content nor the effort for example the hours instead it even says noncredit course this is despite the fact that the course equates  pdus and counts towards the uci project management certificate programm as it was described in the faq i feel betrayed how can i apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere	0
decent course for someone not much exposed to excel pretty basic information but exercises are good and challenging could have been better with more practical approach	2
it was ok there is nothing you will gain from this course that you cant get in a single  hour youtube video instead of   minute videos here the assignments were questionable and the examples used in the first assignment at least no longer exist	1
the content is really an interesting topic that im sure a lot of learners with enjoy however the way it is presented needs a lot of work first the slides are not masterfully made proper word count and transitions are not applied second the length of the lessons are not conducive to learning it needs to be trimmed to shorter lessons or even be cut third it is repetitive and theres too much focus on the unnecessary the lecture needs to be reviewed cracking the creativity code is an interesting topic however the lessons were not presented creatively enough	2
i feel like there should be more teacher involvement within this course	1
the free version of the course is far more restricted than other courses ive taken the content wasnt brilliant and it wasnt really more advanced than other tutorials with far better presenters which can be found online for free	0
a very interesting and broad introduction to a new and exciting form of interdisciplinary form of history that gives a wide perspective on a big range of sciences from biology and cosmology to social and historical sciences would easily recommend for everyone	4
i thought this course was about art and related ideas to my surprise is has a teaching focus which i did not anticipated and which has no interest for me i did not do the final project because it does not interest me thank you for the art part wish there would have been more of it	3
good introductory type course but when there are issues a student is having that no other peer can resolve the instructors are almost never available to assist	1
uses r with no explanation why does it use a challenging programming language that is not the point the point is to learn statisticsuse statcrunch  so students can focus on statistics not programming	0
is not exactly class for the beginners first half covers html and css and quite understandable and easy although it might also help that i had class completely on html and css in the past so i actually know what to do to write necessary code the second part is on javascript and here is where problem starts at least for me i didnt take javascript class in the past and it was all new for me professors try to explain it in few lectures  minutes each and then they expect you to write couple of programs and to make some project from scratch in few days sorry maybe its just me but i got to have much more then about an hour of explanation to do so i would highly recommend anyone who is new to javascript to take javascript class first and then to start this one and no im not new to programming	1
the first round of the capstone was separated in time by about  months from the initial courses so the lack of additional material was rough otherwise the process was a good real word application of ngs processing	2
it is difficult to complain too much about a free course but i expected more from a course carrying the name princeton the videos were generally well done and interesting but did contain factual errors almost every weekunfortunately the instructors were absent from the forums after a couple replies the first week the homework assignments were disorganized provided components contained errors the grading system had problems and the requirements were often unclear the assignments require java programming experience not mentioned in course description most importantly the assignments in no way reflected what was taught in the course videos they were of course related but were implementing parts of a bitcoin node but in a simplified manner the textbook pdf is goodit would have been nice to have assignments working with real bitcoin or testnet transactions sigs verification hashing etcanyhow im enthusiastic about this subject matter so im just happy the course exists but dont expect a glossy polished course its a rough ridehere is another bitcoin course that looks good httpswwwpluralsightcomcoursesbitcoindecentralizedtechnology	2
this course give to you some ideas about what can make one country better than others and the opposite too besides that you can understand a lot of the reasons that can help you in your company job professional life or personal one if you want to improve your knowledges about internacional business that is a very good tool to help you achieve it	4
it helped me to recollect the some areas of exc	2
the material is a bit dry but its essential to writing effective survey questions the course is well designed and easy to follow thanks to the university of michigan and the university of maryland for offering this interesting course i hope to see additional offerings in survey research methods from these professors in the future	3
the course is useful but i hoped that it would cover the area of treatment better than that	4
good material and final quizzes at the end of each week would be helpful also the videos could have been quite a bit shorter	2
material is really interesting and helpful but a lot of bugs in video productions	0
it would have been good to have more assignments using more complex songs and asking for students to try soloing	2
it is really basic course i expected much more even if this is offered only for  the cheapest course in the specialisation	0
very slow pacing but ok content	2
good content for data scientists but video lessons are not sufficient to be able to complete the assignments it required great deal of own searching and trials and errors to complete the course	2
i enjoyed some of this course content but mostly did not enjoy the course delivery the instructor is very warm and friendly but not well articulate also the way the course content is extremely segmented into short videos with  sec intros to each video is extremely distracting and interrupted my concentration i i felt the videos with tiffany were unnecessary and a waste of time also i felt there were not enough examples or really life examples especially later in the course when describing different types of date and analysis	1
very boring presentation of the material i am sorry to say so but the professor is not a very engaging speaker	0
more basic than i was expecting	2
very light in useful content	1
very informative	4
this was a good course to learn how to scrape web data and access apis	3
mostly as good as the course functional programming principles in scala i took couple of years ago however some of the videos are clearly taken from another courses and referencing to content not in this course especially the final weeks content is very confusing topics changing constantly without clear context and presentation i actually purposedly skipped the last few videos as they seemed completely off the track and it was very hard to get anything out of themthe exercices were good starting where the previous course ended and most of the videos were clear and well done basically the videos by martin	3
needs to be more engaging	1
this course progresses extremely slowly but it covers the material as advertised i recommend this to absolute programming beginners	3
a very highlevel introduction but the analytical part is totally missing	0
the course content is okay and covers the basics well enough however the assignments are structured for memorization not learning and contribute little to the experience i decided to cancel my subscription as there are better options on edx and other coursera courses	0
seems like the quality of this specialization goes down with every course the instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in nodejs but he insists on using powerpoint slides to show us how to code its  and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept especially when you are dealing with a new technology for the start the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step that way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the coursei had to take other online courses on code school and pluralsight just to understand whats going on and later come back to finish the homework	0
a bit too simple to be a paid course	1
this course is not organised so well concerning grading processthere is a lot of mistakes in the criteria of grading also the material is not so good i learn nothing new  the worst course i took in coursera actually so no stars goes to this course	0
very insightful course working in the financial industry can often imagine the material learnt being applied in work environment which is rewarding	4
the course lacks for the practice exersises instead the quizes are full of questions like present simple tense is used to write about a special study implemented by a wellknown scientist true or false the questions of this type are pointless still the videos sometimes contain useful information	1
very interesting course	4
a little too theoretical and the subjects are not easy to followit should have more step by step and deep explanation math stuffthe interest rates vs bonds are difficult for begginers it should be transmitted in different ways	2
the scope of the course is really limited and that is fine for superintroductory courses like this one but all the emotional attachments aside looking only into one citys tribunals is questionable from the methodological point of view	2
the course in general is not as good as martin oderskys first course but it still has interesting bits to learn about functional programmingeverything topic feels very disconnected to each otherlastly the last part of the course is specially disorganized i didnt feel like the assignment captured everthing that was taught	2
as a captstonse course i expected this to be more challenging than other courses in the specialisation especially the assignments which should have required to put in some real effort rather than simply executing prewritten scripts and uploading screenshots rest of the courses in the specialisation were superb combined with the awesome teaching skills of dr chuck but capstone was quite disappointing unfortunately	1
i believe this course is critical and much needed given where the industry is heading prof leek has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner however the complexity of the content may challenge most studentsa few more examples with r code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to r code may not be intuitivei would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course having said that i think this is a wonderful starter course to get a glimpse of what machine learning is all about	2
this course is good it was a bit repetive in the beginning and the most interesting content was late in the course i would reccomend you to buy this specialization i think next part will be even better	3
its a good topic however the quality of the lectures are pretty low in my opinion people could learn the topic more efficiently by reading stewarts book	1
i could say this is one of the most useful courses that i ever takeas the last one fsk til now it has been an amazing experience	4
structured course that gives beginner to intermediate level expertise short course so there is not much time to give challenging assignments that would prepare you for a job or industry level skill in this topic the student enrollment was limited compared to my other courses on coursera and hence the discussion forum was not active there is no ta or instructor participation in discussion forum hence my advanced questions in forum intended to learn beyond the course went unanswered you can learn this all on internet but the instructor nicely covered  topics in  weeks which is helpful	2
very good course a lot of practical examples presented by andrew in this course thanks for that	4
even though the theoretical part was well put together case study questions were too vague and should have been better thought out this part of the specialization did not meet my expectation	2
i thought this course was great in the information it provided though it moved a little fast for me as a beginning programmer i think it would be useful to add a separate course just on javascript to the specialization as i still feel pretty lost with js and the introduction of jquery and meteor on a shaky js foundation is quite hard to grasp without a lot of supplemental information from other sites	3
some good content however it is too reliant on reading a lot of white papers and articles some of the readings are very good however a number of them are out of date for example  in a space that has already rapidly evolved since then i would have liked to see more examples of how people are exploring ways to address vulnerabilities and activities for cybersecurity	2
machine learning is the best online module ive taken so far professor ng makes those technical concepts visible us in a very understandable way and the course assignments are at just right difficultyim quite inspired by the content of machine learning and want to pursue a future career in this area it would so great if some higher level courses come next with focus on the application of machine learning algorithms	4
fantastic but want more	4
this course was good but from practical side i was not able to learn anything that thing lacked in this course	3
the instructor was terrible very dull	0
i cant start this course	0
hard and very rewarding to complete	3
it is a supershort course and is helpful mainly to give one an idea of what software product management means i found the lectures on agile principles etc very theoretical and textbookstyle  not too interesting	2
very poor course especially when it gets to the last weeks there are no enough instructions to help you in the exam it is all about money transaction i am sorry to say that	0
a very detailed and comprehensive course	4
was expecting a deeper unsdersting and knowledge of child nutrition and its impact in the health of little ones too general	1
learned very little doesnt actually teach anything but gives some tips by talking the stuff that you can find by using google and clicking on the first link that appears some material gets repeated throughout the course quizzes are a joke really	0
this course covers the basic ground about approximation algorithms and would be very valuable for a practitioner but seems designed for people who already know the materials and is more theoretical than appliedlectures are very abstract with a description of the problem and a formal description of the solution there are few examples with stepbystep tracing of algorithms that is how the algorithm actually works to solve the problem and a significant amount of expertise is assumed so much so that you wouldnt need this course for example there are questions about approximation ratio but it is not explained this seems like something that is inherent to approximation algorithms but is only asked in the examsproject and is not even mentioned in the lectures similar issues abound around the course	1
i am not connecting to the instructor at all the material is well managed and organized but i am not able to really hear or understand further my connection to the site is disturbing in this and a couple of other courses the video lectures jump around and begin in the middle of the lecture between these two issues i am not having a good experience with this course i live in the us and have graduate degrees in public health 	1
best course on financial market	4
an excellent overview of regression techniques in machine learning with a very well thoughtout balance between explaining concepts providing enough maths to support the concepts even with some optional deep dive lessons for those interested in the really technical details i think this course is an excellent start to get a grip on the concepts before diving into formal proofs highly recommended	3
only the link agilemanifestoorg has real value in this course the rest is selfpr and water i see no reason paying for the sertificate and i am not convinced further cources of this specialization will deliver greater value	1
very general content not as useful as i thought it would be but maybe i should have read the introduction better	1
it was a really good course but i think theres a lot of repetitions in many lectures itd be good to avoid that aspect in order to provide more information to the people	3
it is too small and shallow whole specialization is actually one full course split into  tiny parts	1
a bit basic	1
great course	4
very fundamental if they can talk about some ui design principle that would be  stars	3
didnt teach more	1
very very interesting and well explained	3
the content of the course was goodhowever i did not like the presentation of the material moreover such a topic would need to be covered by a longer duration course	1
at first the presentations are really on a semi professional level copy  paste codes making errors without knowing the cause they show a lot what can be done with swift but the never showmention what its really usefull for no real life usage just snippets after snippetsto few practical doings mostly only quiz stuff	0
i am a civil engineer yet i enjoy programming i have enjoyed a lot and learned well with such an amazing instructors i believe they are the best instructors for matlab learning this course has become a memory for me its an amazing experience i loved solving homework problems in this course	4
very poor course low depth of teaching assignments awfully developed	0
overall very detailed and informative a great way to get insight into english common law i just felt that in the last week  perhaps the transcripts in english had a few mistakes and seemed to be missing out a few words of the lecturer also a few grammatical mistakes which seemed slightly odd nevertheless very happy ultimately	3
best learning experience	4
this great course and greate insturactor	2
this course provides general introduction to software product management which can help students to pick up founding concepts of a number of how a product management cycle looks like as well as the spirit of agile practicesas an introductory course the material do not cover practical tools or details on how the actual product management should carry on expect the students should take the full specialization to advance the skills and knowledge to take the knowledge into a practical level	2
great	4
the course content is great and the tutor is doing a great job but i didnt like the fact that im forced to use github to submit my assignments	1
very informative and interesting course however it was mind bogglingly confusing about what was exactly required for the final assignment please be clearer next time	2
just for get our opinion	1
very basic	1
the professors sound like a group of firstyear students presenting a group project literally reading notes off of a powerpoint slide the professors also cant speak english so instead of explaining things in depth they have to very very slowly read basic phrases to explain complex subject matter off of whats basically a teleprompter	0
peng is incomprehensible i give up	1
absolutely brilliant course excellent content only problem is that it is impossible to get help if you need support	3
i like the pace of the course	4
interesting history of neural networks and excellent coverage of all main architecturescouple of problems during the quizzes an update is needed	2
excellent to better understand those new threats	4
great course overall should only explain better a few related concepts such as the pvalue and confidence interval	3
this is a great course i have worked in the operations sides of the business and this course gave me much need perspective into the corporate finance and account domains thank you to the two professors involved great content and easy to follow and understand the reasoning and the why	4
material is very high level no ppts are given so all links presented in the videos cannot be viewedquizzes are based upon old packages so incorrect answers are providedno replies at discussion board from tas or instructors	0
courses are really worth doing it helps lot to clear our concepts	4
good introduction into python programming but could be more programming exercises in this course	4
worst course i have ever seen on coursera such a shame as the subject is very exciting and the lectures in the first couple of weeks are a monotonous jabble	0
no systematic presentation of concepts very hard to follow	0
not happy with the quality of the material dropped the whole specialization halfway through this class	1
this was really basic information its not really a  week course it takes several hours the info is necessary but its sufficient as a single week of content for a larger course	1
nice course and interesting material but the other students evaluation is quite subjective	3
too compact and short should be integrated to other courses	0
gets way too indepth with the math behind regression to the point that it deters from the learning process was hoping to learn better methods of interpreting or enacting regression not the inner workings of the algorithmsassignments got overly complex with confusing instructions there are definitely some leaps made in the assumptions of what students python capabilities are vague instructions caused more frustration than desire to continue learningwill continue in the specialization but will not hesitate to drop out if instruction continues like thisvery disappointed	0
the peerreview rubrics need adjustments its very hard to grade anyone this way especially when the answers are just wrongthe staffteachersinstructors can be a lot more involved on the forum	0
poor visual aids course content and format	0
good lectures and content but the guidance for the assignments are not particularly clear at times it feels like grading parameters and questions are just loosely coupledon a more personal level i found that the deadline at the end of the same week of the lectures does not allow for a lot of time to ponder and digest the information ive tried a few other moocs they all granted students the week after the lecture to prepare for the assignment	2
it was good and simple	3
i dont know why quizzes are locked even though im enrolled in this course and already done watching all videos in it	0
a sharp decline in quality and cohesion from the functional programming principles in scala course it may be worth enrolling just to hear oderskys elegant lecturing at work once again but if youre interested in the core concepts i would highly recommend picking up a highly rated book instead	1
cannot do the tests after modules no reply from staff	0
a good introduction in generalhowever more practical exercises are required	2
the labs are not up to date and several things do not work as they should i had to fix several of the provided scripts to finish them	1
in my opinion this course does not fit to the specialization well not sure how big proportion of the specialization students have a background different from data science and are going to manage the data science team	1
i learned very much in this course and i am thankful for the opportunity to have taken it i found some of the quiz questions to be unnecessarily difficult because of how specific they were to the videos of the language informants but overall i enjoyed the course and the wide range of supplemental materials that are offered	3
a lot of talking little content	1
much trivial content but advertised as an expert course further the assignments did not work properly at the beginning and there is no timely response of staff i would not waste money on that course again and will probably try to get refund in time	0
i wrote some indepth feedback but par for the course i cant save it  either here or on the discussion board nothing obscene but certainly some major frustration with format inconsistencies in scoring and format information not reviewed in the course on some of the quizzes the fact that coursera keeps trying to sell me the specialty the lack of any moderator on the discussion board to provide assistanceand can go on with the technical issues to but i wont	0
somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coding that i could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it i had to cheat i dont feel like i am learning anymore	0
extremely useful exercises in pulling data down and getting it ready to process within python very nice and refreshing realistic that the programming assignments were of the form modify this existing code to do something new with this different data source rather than build something new from scratch no academic hangups about the paedogogical value of building something from the ground up and dr chuck is a wonderfully engaging teacher	4
i really like this course and how the lecturer presented the content in a very pleasing pace	4
not too difficult and good structure very interesting	4
not very well put together it marked some answers as wrong that were actually correct	0
decent start to engineering	3
covers basics well the video lectures are easy and simple to understand liked the assignments and they covered the learned content well	3
great im chemistry and this course is very useful to remember all things have you learnt in the university thank u	4
it was an excellent course and i have learned a lot out of itthe presenter style was very nice and clearthe slides were properly designedit was a very pleasant experience indeed	4
its really great for beginners	4
nice content but a few bugs with the videos and sound track when watching online	2
very through introduction course very helpful for those who are preparing for pmp exam 	0
this is a very basic course not at all college level	1
very little to do with excel mostly focused on statistics with brief overviews of how things could be done within excel but very little focus on actual excel use and knowledge	1
very poorly presented course despite having completed quite a number of coursera courses before and even being already familiar with a good deal of the preliminary material in this one i soon abandoned it due to the inadequate and scrappily prepared presentation of material mercedes paniccia in particular speaks in a virtually unintelligible expressionless monotone with no explanation or elaboration to relieve what amounts to little more than a list of definitions and bald statements such as can be found in the glossary section of many textbooks i would strongly recommend finding an alternative course devoted to the subject or maybe seeking out a readable textbook	0
the lecturer is kind of boring	2
in my humble opinion it is necessary to review some points in this module video content making more dynamic switch between explanations and slides in full screen only explanations it is very tiring to attend the classes the video would be ideal as shown in week  of this mooc how the hotel shouldnt work with expedia or video how to hotel shouldnt work with bookingcom analysis requested in the first week the requested analysis was of a very high level it required knowledge of financial analysis and hotel area in my case i felt much difficulty because i do not have any knowledge in the hotel industry and analyzing the exercise i realized it was necessary to have knowledge of financial ratios of profitability and a certain familiarity in the hotel industry i left a comment on the discussion board stating that i was not feeling safe to do the exercise however there was no demonstration by the teachers of the coursein short i was not feeling prepared let alone analyze colleagues the first time did not get the minimum score the second time with the longest time i could better perform the exercise but rather it was the result of review of financial ratios and other other accessories i realized that those who examined me in the first and second time had little or no idea about financial analysis and another point that struck me was that one of the people who fell for me to analyze was all in white and the person apologized for failing to do with nothing to analyze i did not think fair to give a low rating so i preferred not to analyze if the person left blank something needs to be revisedwhen mounting a course you have to take into consideration that there are different levels of students beginner intermediate and advanced in the subject matterthe first week was not to have been given is analysis it could have been the third or fourth week of this mooc so it would have time for a further deepening of the matter addressed amount of content adding the video quiz and analysis are about  content it is very tiring and little time for such content could decrease the amount of video and quiz relocating to another week course or mooc feedback teachers need to leave a contact way facebook twitter etc and be active in coursera forum or leave a wizard to ask questions when needed notes he missed the weight of the notes i found a little confusing the allocation of notes curriculum missed curriculum biography of teachers no contact information books missed suggestions of books in the hotel industryanyway these are only observed points in order to contribute to development of course thanks for listening	2
very good course for understanding webdevelopment	3
too little information	1
best course i have attended so far	4
useful and creative work	3
the course provides a good insight into the world of aerial robotics and the dynamics involved in controlling the quadrotors were the course fails is it does not explain the basics  there is more focus on trial and error and the questions are not formulated correctly such that they are simple to understand it could have been better if the introductory course to the specialization had little mathematical involved or could have been explained in simpler terms or with examples instead of showing the equation in the video	2
it gives you an interesting visions about hot subjects and provides with sources to go deeper maybe a course to short on each topic covered	3
the course is very short and more advanced courses are not free	0
great inspirative course learning how to learn is about optimizing brain mechanism to obtain understanding	4
this course is conducted mostly more or less by reading just the slides	0
this is one of the best courses i have taken ever	4
this course is fantastic	3
short and sweet easy and quick and gives a genx some insight into geny and now genc	2
designed more for a child learning about poetry for the first time some of the facts about poetry arent accurate the effort to make the class more engaging ironically only distracts from the course material the time spent attempting humor could have been spent on teaching but instead a lot of time is wasted by speaking down to the viewer like they are a toddler i did not finish this class as i couldnt stand the videos	1
would of liked to see more programming examples in the lectures but all in all fun course	2
still needs a better way of explaining the diversity of the course	2
i want it to be more exciting	1
i started this training with great anticipation by the central theme data mining and was surprised with an excellent training on data visualization the richness of detail and material supply should inspire other training also the coursera i have accomplished	4
poor presentation skills mostly reading slidesunclear and inconsistent in what prerequisite knowledge is needed for the course in one place he assumes one does not know digital logic but then later he assumes you know hardware languages fpga design etcwas a waste of time shame on coursera that prerequisite knowledge was removed from the site	0
the course doesnt prepare you for the final project	0
very good as an introductory class i really chucks teaching style and his way of explaining helps a lot would for sure complete these course series	4
ok the main professor clearly knows his stuff on the other hand he goes into unnecessary detail and then quizzes you on it even though its not relevant to the course typical bricks and mortar education type bs the assistant instructors likely this guys students are not as great and the whole thing is amateur night	1
most material cut and pasted from older lectures shiller offers strong foundational knowledge and excellent perspectives multiple prestigious guest speakers offer a nice change of pace a little content heavy per week but quizzes are an easy and fast application of knowledge to progress to the next week	3
i wish this course was for free with the assignments	0
not what i expected for a machine learning course	1
very good course but it needs more details and examples	3
it is very interesting and informative course with great professor	4
basically impossible to complete quizzes and course project using the provided course material poor correlation between instruction and testing makes one wonder if i need to solicit others guidance to complete your tests why am i paying for your guidance in the first place	0
i didnt learn a whole lot perhaps it is because im not coming into a professional setting as a newbie anymore i found a lot of the examples juvenile  wearing a robe to the office or stealing things i was looking for more substantial examples of idealogical conflict i guess stuff that is harder to resolve than being a person of integrity and making good decisions i know this is just module  but the content didnt feel valuable for the most part the assignments were alright	1
its unbelievable is how many way you can rephrase the same idea over and over again without making any progress in something new	0
after watching so many videos like how i got started on seo how to find a job as seo how to answer in an interview for seo jobs ive realized this course really needs to focus on what people wants to hear we want to learn seo not how someone got started on seo	0
well structured easy to follow and very very usefulthank you for such a great course	4
very little modelling in this course instead you get some accounting lectures which are pretty difficult to follow if you have no previous accounting knowledge very boring lectures too	1
the content of the course is ok the main problem is that the way the information is presented ilkay altintas who is the main lecturer is a sweet woman but lecturing from a manuscript is not her strongest side it is clear that she is reading from a screen while she is looking into the camera anyone could do that job and they should have chosen more of an news anchor type of person with better pronunciation and more flow its simply very uninspiring and boring to listen to also  dollars is far too expensive for such a short course	1
good application oriented machine learning course thanks for graphlab team	4
good contents however the lectures are long and a bit rushed this course is definitely not for everyone assignment for week  definitely need an extra lecture to explain to do pid tuning	3
this is very good course for beginners and well explained wit practical example	3
im not going to recommend this course strongly i learned from it not denying that the reading materials were great there are critical organization issues to learn but there are two things i dont like first the assignment is not well designed article reflection is a convenient way to give an assignment but sometimes off the topics in the course notes other courses have along assignments but they are much better designed second the instructor threw a lot of terminologies with much explanations i dont think people would ever remember or use them correctly why bother using them	2
although this course holds quite a lot of information it is quite slow in the way the information is transmitted and unfortunately the presenter did not made homework in terms of preparing what to say in addition to the lagging of so anyways uhmm or just silence many of the videos are also quite low in quality  especially sound due to bad microphoneoverall the information was interesting and useful and im looking for part ii	1
this course was very good and very interesting the teacher explained things well the big problem with the course is that the level of the lectures no way matched the level of the assignments especially the last one it was way too hard compared to the material presented it was supposed to take  hours but it took me more like  hours and from the forum it seems like a lot of people spend  or more hours on this one last problem was too hard and too much a lot of prayer and sweat i finally got it with a lot if discussion on the forums but  hours for one problem is crazy there needed to be a lot more thorough instruction in order to do this problem in a reasonable time	2
assingnments are not grading so i do not have reason to study something that cant finish	0
good learning with explanation on basic financials	2
seemed like more of two week advertisement of the specialization and agile rather than a course some good information in the video lectures but very heavy handed on the delivery	2
well thought class by a very professional teacher easy to get access to a higher level of statistics	3
the material on graph analytics was of introductory level a string of interesting ideas with unclear explanations the lesson on graphx was basically a copypaste introduction to its abilities without actually teaching how to use it the transcripts are full of mistakes someone not proficient in english or hard of hearing would be confused by them it was somewhat difficult to understand the main lecturer the best part was the explanation of neoj  and it was at an introductory level a disappointment	0
lean too heavily towards theory instead of practice i do think peergraded assignments work better than quiz in term of ux lessons	2
do not recommend chaotic and full of irrelevant imo information does it really matter in which year some paper was written or from which latin word the term interest rate derives	1
no structure for the course	1
difficult content not explained well by the presenters	1
the course is a good overall approach to humancomputer interaction it teaches how to do participan observation interviewing storyboarding and heuristic evaluationhowever i would say that some of the assignments were too simple in terms of complexity and there was few opportunities to apply the theory in the assignmentsin general i found the course useful for people who want to learn more about how understand better customer necessities for design in general	2
many videos lacked associated pdf slides so confusing to watch some topics on slides were not covered in videos a supplemental video for those would be great even of optionalbrian cato is a good presenter however more examples needed to be done showing how to work out various statistical problems both by traditional method and using r	0
difficult to understand the video lectures at time but really useful content excellent further reading sections at the end of each module	2
i had done all the tasks in februarymarch  i dont remember exactly when but i received my certificate in may the course was interesting but i needed the certificate for my application to university now im so dissapointed	1
autograder will not accept my valid code that contains all valid elements will not make the deadline so will not bother continuing	0
good course explaining basics on infographic	3
first university of pennsylvania and we still have to deal with a heavy accentsecond couldnt tell if all the vocab gone over repeatedly was standard or made up by the profthird stilted repetitive and boring teaching style	1
i currently taking this capstone and i must unfortunately say that this is the most worst course in the whole specialization of course the topic nlp and word prediction is interesting but the problem is that this is a dead course a couple of students in the forum strugeling with details but there is no mentor no professor or other course staff and no swiftkey engineer as announced in the project overviewso everything you have to figure out completely by yourself and this takes a lot of more time than the  hours and also why should you pay for a course where you learn anyway only ba your ownpick any intersting topic you would like to work on and invest the time in this instead of paying for this capstone without any support form coursera jhu or swiftkey	0
it was interesting to learn on how to better manage my time although was too theoretical	2
amazing course for beginners with a little bit of common sense	3
just bare essentials  can be found online in other places for free	2
if i could give it less than  star i would it wasnt an excel class rather it was a targeted business statistics class with only disjointed lectures and no benefit of textbook to actually help you learn lots of errors in the lectures and tests and little to no support from course staff stay away you wont regret it	0
covers the basic of linear regression would like to see more advanced material	2
i recommend this course for theoretical knowledge only i was very upset with the programming assignments  they are few they are not consistent in difficulty level and the way they being checked is not convenient	2
this is the specialisation that sucks all joy out of the entire course  month on and i am still on week  the software and the provided files are not fully working something is always missing constant error messages if you dont have background in statistics you will have a very difficult time	0
i wish the teachers would go more into how to come up with solutions to the functional problems	1
a great refresher very practical examples and knowledge great fundamentals course	4
the word toolbox made me think there was more in the course introduction or maybe overview  may have been more accurate good course otherwise	2
this course is just definitions i will finish the course but i do not recommend it for someone who needs a technical approach i was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises mixed with their accompanying definitions this course are pure lectures no practice beyond openended questions i wish it was a blend of lectures and practice and not so purely academic	1
the lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality the assignment questions were often nebulous this resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader the discussion forums were the best part of this class id encourage the course instructors to take a look at the university of washingtons machine learning class stylistically pedagogically and contentwise  thats a much much better data science class	1
great course	4
too much theoreticalthis course should not be a separate courseit can be a part of other course	1
great highlevel overview that introduces some very interesting concepts great intro for those who are just exploring this area of study entices you to dive deeper into the topic	3
the teachers have a strong spanish accent and they fail in what they try to teach improving	0
the cource was very informative and easy to follow	3
good class the teacher is very clear and the content pedagogic and coherently organized the examinations topic was very interesting	4
thank you very much for offering such a wonderful course	4
fantastic course thank you wharton	4
presenter speaks too slow still slower than i would like at x speed not a lot of new information	1
this is definitely not a course for beginners 	1
i understand it is a technical subject but going slide after slide reading the material without any clear explanation is not learning is just recitingit would have been better to try and put only half of the facts we can always search for specific flag and explain more about use casesthere has to be a better way to pass the materials	0
great course amazing teacher the pace of course is convinient	4
proprietary to me is unacceptable but the professors really do have a charm to them so i will give them an extra star for that	1
this course is really well done i will definitely enrol for the next level 	4
wonderful course im so glad i did it the professors are great loved all the explanations and exercises	4
a lot of stuff is just glossed over and not spent enough time on	1
i do not recommend you to waste your time planned course activities for a week  just  minute speech of the lecturer telling absolutely banal things and a few questions absolutely useless	0
quite confusing if you do not have a background already in accounting the information in the course content does not match up with the quizzes great experience but a little lacking on the details needed to pass the quizzes each weekespecially week	2
its sometimes difficult to follow professors beacuse they take for granted information about the examples they use that is not evident for the learners they should take a minute to explain a little bit more what the examples consist of and what are the charts they show as it happens when brian caffo explains the blocking adjustments part	2
not bad for who have never met the seo	1
great course	3
too much emphasis on irrelevant factrepeating eg date a convention was signed rather than content and implications of the content for practice	2
questions seem geared towards school children having ridiculously obvious answers in multiple choice is an insult and i now think ive wasted my time doing this course as your accreditation will mean nothing to business in the future if you are just giving accreditation away so easily	1
the material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics but i have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared the lectures are not well organized some necessary prerequisite should be at least provided as reading materials quizs ask some questions that is not clearly mentioned in the lecture and some are with a little ambiguity	1
love the works of the class videos are easy to follow and go along great with the provided notes	4
the teachers are easy to like but the course content is very lightweight and will mostly teach you terminology with no real understandingthe worst part was the assignments which could all be solved by a little copypaste i didnt learn anything useful by doing them all the actual algorithms were supplied in a separate module more than that many of the suggested solutions were bad coding like collapsing  of the data before training or writing sixteen special cases rather than a general function or pointless like training a linear classifier on pixel datathere are better courses out there	1
it seems to simple although considering that it is for new programmer	3
this course increases my motivation on learning how to program	4
very engaging professor easily understood the obvious editing was very distracting and made one wonder what was being deleted	3
a nice course and very helpful	4
this is a very basic course that introduces you to the topic but doesnt go into much depth while its clear that a lot of time was spent filming and creating the course material i still would not recommend this course both the presentation itself and the invideo quizzes are unbelievably obnoxious the presenter emphasizes every other word and talks in a very unnatural manner that makes it very tiring to listen to and the invideo quizzes are far too basic and take up too much time sometimes you also have to go to an external site in order to do the activities which are badly designed and just frustrating overall i recommend waiting for a better course	1
its really hard to communicate with coursera i have paid for the course havent enrolled due to my illness and there is nobody who can help me out with thisits a very nice project coursera but still has too much to make up what a pitymartin	0
very interesting course but also very technical id rather say it is not made for someone who has no basics in advanced mathematics nevertheless i have learnt many useful things and i have now a great outlook on the asset management world	2
this class was full of great information and is really cool for any animal lover especially dogs	3
i am a statistician who works primarily with r with some python for the things python is better for i know how to program but i explicitly note i am not a computer science student i have only limited experience with the command prompt i was very excited when i heard about this course but the amount of work and frustration just to get started programming in scala has been obscene i am very very glad i decided to check out the course for free before paying for the specializationthe course has a lot of required software the tutorials to get this software often involve you need this but so save time were going to skip showing you how to get it if it doesnt work you need to install it there is a lot of variability in oss many errors are often encountered there is no helpamong the things the course requires are two three ides for scala i note the video tutorials says you just need some sort of ide but you need intellij and eclipse to submit the guides show how to get started on a mac the software is not the same on windows and so step by step instructions become a guessing game because many options or menus are missing or differentthere are many better and more friendly guides on the internet i may return to the transcripts of the course content here but i wont be submitting any coursework im going to warn my colleagues away as well forget coursera  ill just buy a book and work through it like everyone else i know	0
this course was way too basic the instructor basically just gave us links to existing web content very disappointed in the course it felt like the instructor was lazy to develop a real curriculum	0
the lectures in this course were very good but i would have preferred much much more homework to practice the concepts covered in the lecturesalso i was somewhat disappointed when a certain issue with the course that i asked about in the forums was never addressed by the course staff of course i could have been wrong about it but but based on the response from other students i was not the only one having this problem	2
good for public education with general nutrition knowledge integrated with environmental protection practical behaviors and cooking exercises	3
fantastic introduction to a topic i always found daunting thanks to everyone involved for preparing such an informative and soft approach to a hard topic like data science	4
great course	4
excellent course i already knew a lot about r  but this class helped me solidify what i already knew taught me lots of new tricks and now i have a certificate that says i know something about r	4
my background is in software development so i know a thing or two about writing code im about halfway through the course and im really struck by two things	1
this is a hard subject to teach myself i found the instruction distracting i think in attempt to be enthusiastic the instructors frittered away my attention by terrible coincidence my computer blew up real life intervened in that and other ways i will continue to try to learn calculus but this didnt work for me	1
great course very insightful	4
instructor speaks too slow and sometimes hardly audible with my earphones plugged in with  sound incredibly slow paced coffee must too much of story and history and introduction much less material presented for concepts shown much of the lecture time is wasted on things which does not matter for example djikstra shortest path i would be more interested to know about the algorithm than a huge lecture on who is djikstra and also would like to have some exercise to implement the same and realise very unsatisfied with the course but there is no other courses offered for c programming language in english language not worth the time	0
nice course should be taken once you are done with the computer science basic courses like data structures algorithms etc	3
i have taken the course earlier so am somewhat familiar with the layout and the materials overall it is a very good course and covers a wide range of subject matters roger has done a very good job explaining the concepts i certainly would recommend this course to all whos interested in the subjecti realize that theres limitation on the time people suppose to spend each week however i would like to suggest adding homework in addition to quizzesseveral video clips have some audio issues not sure if thats fixable	3
mostly common sense but it is a good reinforcement i like listening to the storiesexamples but they could have been shorter and the course would have felt like a more efficient use of time	2
a great introduction into machine learning hoping andrew develops a second stage to this course for more advanced topics thanks 	4
this course introduce you to some kind of good behaviours to apply to social media but actually it is some kind of well manners that everybody should apply in social life of course it makes you aware that in both cases you should apply the same behaviour but i found it a bit too logical	1
course material providing outdated concepts argumentation throughout the course is shallow many of the the current arguments are not mentioned  from both sides of the energy lobby fossil  renewables	1
course material is very poor and did not give much support for doing assignments	0
i enjoyed this course i was a good introduction to python the videos and material are easy to understand i look forward to taking the other courses in this specialization	3
so great	4
a nice introductory coursehowever i found the latter half of the course too skewed towards the usa	2
very nice course it is a pity that the legal framework is almost exclusively focused on the us	2
like it most the epicurean philosophy	3
cover very broad range of topic	4
this was thefirst course i payed for and unfortunately the worst expieriencelack of content beyond the stuff in the available simple swift tutorials andfrom an eduucational pint of view afwully if at all preparedits as shame that i cannot give this course zero stars which it deservesi should have checked the very negative feedback of the former participants before bying iti will be much much more alert regarding content on coursera from now on	0
some notions introduced too fast and with little explanations overall very interesting and applicable	3
excellent course  phenomenal exposure to contemporary debates and theories 	4
the course itself is fun the videos are enjoyable the subject matter is great however the quizzes are way to hard they ask to many questions with multiple answers and the online student is expected to know so much more materials that is probably taught in the actual class and does not have access to for that it becomes frustrating especially that the material is not easy to digest	2
very eye opening videos were very clear and the explanations were clear	2
very good course love the way it is thanks	4
ive loved this journey with passionate teacherslearners they share a general mindset and powerful tips to optimize our learning already profitable for me	4
level of difficulty of lectures is not correspond with level of quizzes in lectures they are talking about simple stuff and then in quizzes they ask you about details they didnt mentioned you could deducts this information though but this is exactly the main problem with this course  for quizzes you should deduct and learn by yourself so much stuff that videos start to be not worth your time	1
too much time required the first quiz had almost nothing covered in the video lectures i saved all transcripts and was unable to answer the questions the sims i have never seen anything like that and again  it most certainly wasnt covered in the lectures disappointed in this course it took  hours for each segment of the first week not  to  as was stated leaving this course	1
very useful course 	4
not enough face to camera time in comparison with the other two modules in this course specialization for me that made it harder to recall the information effectively but a very interesting topic	2
not enough information on how to approach the final project the project itself is very time consuming with lots of self learning and unclear specifications	1
a waste of time one long advertisement for the instructors book	0
you should tell people before they enroll that to take the quizzes they must pay it was a waste of time	0
the course is over loaded with extremely long videos otherwise it is an excellent course	3
great course for teachers or those like me who want to gain general knowledge i like the diversity of reading video content and quizzes and the aspects of geology that were covered	2
good course introduces the basics well with a good emphasis on the underlying math bayesian techniques are missing also another suggestion  assignment submission in other languages  especially r  the industry language for prototyping ml algorithms	2
great introduction to the course and very helpful	4
very comprehensive and good introduction to bootstrap and jquery	3
not as inspiring as developing innovative ideas but yet a very informative course i only audited the course	2
just started so tryen to get a hang of it ill rate better later if i like it but my minds tellen me that im going to be rating you guys  stars later in the futer	1
the course feels pretty shallow and it ignores all the interesting stuff like proofs there is no written material available so if you cant follow the lectures poor you quizzes arent very well formulated and sometimes the correct answer is more of a matter of opinion rather than a hard fact evaluation seems to be based solely on peer review and there are no model solutions available so the points youll get may vary depending on how your peers understood the assignment and if they were interested in the review process at allmy overall feeling is that nothing was quite challenging on the course and i didnt learn much more than what i could have learnt by reading a few paragraphs per topic from wikipedia i also felt that the programming assignments were quite disjoint from the core tough i dont feel like i understand the core better than before the course because none of the assignments made me think why something works rather than that we just mechanically reproduced the examples shown in the lectures	1
was a little too basic would have preferred more flesh both implementational and mathematical on the bones i also found it absurd that each time the professor introduced a very basic linear algebra concept he kept saying somewhat patronizingly this is for the experts in linear algebra come on if one is taking a machine learning course one can expect more from the students otherwise the course ends up being a flaky tapdance on the surface of the material	1
videos are poorly done and leave a lot of useful details out there is zero support from staff in the forums if you take this course plan on spending a lot of time doing research on external sources in order to gain an understanding of the very broad and lacking in detail videosto improve this course the instructors shouldprovide links to at least one textbook on swiftadd mentors to the course to help students in the forumsinclude a repository of code snippets for practice of the concepts	1
very good intro course to machine learning  it gives you the intuition behind all algorithms from the very beginning definitely recommend	4
wordy dirge like the topic is interesting but the exposition is so boring  the reading of a lecture outline  that id rather study on my own 	0
the ideas presented in the course are interesting relevant and impactful i wish the course was a little less conversational however i thought it was valuable and sparked new ideas thoughts and behaviors	2
lot of math but i can handle it i learned a lot and i love it thank you	4
there is not support in the forum	2
very objective theoretical and empirical point of view of terrorism very clear explanations and very interesting lectures added about the subject very recommendable	3
getting harder than the first class in python a good course for first learner to get further python knowledgedoctor severance is a vary qualified and humorous teacher puts efforts into this coursesif you have time you can go through material efficiently and get the credit	4
the lectures were done well the tests should have more real world scenario questions then just asking about specifics terms used in a given process	2
on later parts the videos are poorly edited and less interactive in one place practice quiz has wrong answer marked as right whether its a situational question or behavioral	2
somehow i feel the course materials were not prepared well also it was not effective presentation it was more like a reading a presentation	2
the teaching content is not at the same level of what required to complete the final project which frustrated the beginners and also stop me from finishing the whole course what a pity	2
the professor doesnt explain clearly as part of the videos is his correcting himself or saying the same thing two or three times and why must the videos show the teacher it distracts from the slides and seeing him move doesnt help understand anything betterconcepts like vif or hat values are not very well explained by the teacher at least the swirl lesson explains it correctly anova and ancova are mentioned in the description but they arent explained anywhere anova is used without any explanation of what it isi found myself searching online for other sources to understand the concepts	1
good and basic understanding of termscan be made vast	2
might be good for someone looking for a casual overviewi really wanted to like this course and was excited about the series very disappointing refunded after scoring  on first three weeks and watching the theory portion of week  i was familiar with the subject prior to taking this course was hoping for a deep divetoo many trivially short and low information density videos handwavy mathematics i would have liked to get a more solid idea of the depth of the series from the first course before committing moneydefault software for the course has nearzero market penetration per indeedcom unless maybe you work at apple  not really excusable for something that purports realworld value yes you can use other software except for the capstone per another reviewer this is fatalpresenters just not fully prepared to lecture on the topic the nail in the coffin was the end of the week  lectures on clustering so at this point you really should be able to go out there and build a really cool retrieval system for doing news article retrieval or any other really really really cool retrieval that i cant think of right now but of course theres lots of interesting examples so go out there and think of ideas that i cant think of right now really how about cut take twomany poor design choices for the presentation too much time spent writing things on slides that should have already been on the slidesas of this review no reviews on the last courses in the series and some poor but indicative reviews of the other courses	0
i liked the concise content covering various aspects of the corporate strategy and the online learning platform is a great experience	4
coursera keeps changing my rating not cool	1
i thought the course admirably fulfilled my expectations for a general introduction to game theoryit kept maths to a minimum and the explanations were clear and always backed up by examplesseeed to be very little forum activity dont know why maybe thats just says soething about the sort of people who want to learn about game theoryits a good length with a good amount of time dedicated each week sometimes it was a bit challenging but all round pretty good i thought	3
the overall outline are great however the contents and requirements of this course are too simple to be integrated as a whole course i think  lecture should be enough i am looking forward to deeper introduction	2
the course could have more materials more details explanations 	3
it would be better if it was more interactive the videos arent very helpful for a beginner programmer and the assignments are pretty challenging i still feel like i learned something though but mostly from swirl which is a pretty cool thing	2
the quality of the slides video and presentation in this course is much lower than those offered by this speciality or coursera in general very disappointed in this	0
very boring and uninteresting delivery	0
no content for the first two weeks only links to websites	0
well structured engaging educating with good use of modern communicaton tools	4
great intro to rails with active record and action pack	4
the topics are all very basic and the audiovideo is subpar but the course offers a coherent overview of the core topics of time management and several useful tools and resources together with a few pointers to relevant literature on the topic such as david allens gtdapplying all of the techniques presented in the course is a surefire way to enhance ones own productivity both at work and in the private life	2
the course and specialization looks promising but i get the feeling that the instructors have been a little lazy while designing the assignments instead of autograding using well known testing frameworks like other coursera courses the entire grading policy is based on reviews from fellow students which makes your grade subjective secondly since the number of mandatory required reviews for each student is fixed at  and is not adjusted with the number of students it is highly unlikely that all submissions will be reviewed or graded	0
i cant finish the friggin course i can code fluently in html css and javascript but cant figure out how to upload a pdf assignment here this students user experience is atrocious	0
i really enjoied with this course  i feel exiciting	4
the course is just  minute video of an overview of the topic then an assignmentmany topics are replicated from previous courses in the same speclization	1
the first few weeks are truly beginnerintro course stuff and the entire course is well taught however weeks  ramp up at far too fast of a pace i spent  hours every week trying to keep up and it just moved too fast the instructor was doing things at breakneck speed with little explanation it gets very discouraging by the end because you simply cant play the material i think this course is really for people who are relearning guitar or already have musical backgrounds	0
nice study for starting in field of data science	3
great course for introduction actually the course itself does not tell detail enough for fully understanding of game theory extra studies are needed such as the reference book the article mentioned in the first week and also wikipediaorg but the lecture is good enough for us to know what we should search for	4
basically i resume of economics concepts that can be taken for granted as a prerequisite of the course	1
good course all basics	2
unfortunately the course is not very well thought out the lecture videos are poorly organized concepts are not presented in the proper context and lack sufficient detaildepth little thought or effort was put into designing the examples in the videos there are no actual coding exercises until the last week there are no examples of elegant code nor thoughtful examples of good vs bad code the quizzes contain questions that are poorly worded and ambiguous and i think some actually have the wrong answers and are contradicted by other online resources its very high level and they handwave important concepts i really dont see how this class can actually teach you to build a robust highquality app youre probably better off just reading some of the official documentation online	0
this is basically just one giant commercial for the web site a whole lot of talk but not a lot of information i was going to finish the course anyway to pick up what is in there but i just cannot stand any more plugs very disappointed	0
a nice starting for those wanted to understand data science	3
nothing but badly put together videos and recommendations for readings the only terrible course on coursera ive come across and ive done a few dozen of them	0
love this course and the professor quite a style	4
the entirety of this course can be taught in a few sentences if there is too great a sacrifice to productivity for the sake of security then people will find a way around any security mechanisms in place if something is difficult to use then people will likely not use it	0
excellent content very clear and easy to understand with good examples and exercises	4
no real teaching attempted in this course as far as i can see	1
too much information for a short amount of time to compile i liked the questions in the middle of the videos but i would be great to always have the justification of the answers for a more profund learnning	2
the assignments could be a little bit more challenging on the other hand they each address some part of the skills i want to learn probably i should hold my breath for the capstone 	3
this course was amazing i hope the course will be updated in the near future with more depth to current exploration i personally would suggest the new horizon mission the rosetta mission the discovery of enceladus subsurface global ocean andor stephen hawkings  million prize	4
good overview of htmlcssjavascript nice audiovideo quality and preparation fun homework assignments and exampleswould have liked more css touches	3
could be better spread out over a longer duration	1
very short and just a basic overview on how to install a few tools that most of them i already had installed all this course content could be packed into an introductory lesson instead of having to pay for it i abandoned the specialisation because of this i know its a big business but at least you need to offer some value for the money	0
in my opinionthe topics reviewed were too haphazardly selectedthe citations for quoted research were hard to impossible to findthe course focused disproportionately on the lecturers commercial ventures	0
i enjoyed professor seamons lectures and i also enjoyed his book while you do not need to purchase the book it is well written and really helpful and interesting professor seamon has an endearing and personal style which makes the material come to life the movie selection was excellent and helped reinforce many of the technical definitions about memory i feel the quizzes could have been a little more challenging overall a very enjoyable experience	3
thank you for the fantastic effort heres some constructive feedback on the courseits a very basic course could have included more material also the audio quality is not that great to make it better id include more walkthroughs for git and github	2
provides a very good overview of product management and process management and the role of product manager however this is high level and introductory overview	4
its not worth the price	0
i really liked the way this course was organized it offered a good mix of multiple choice quizzes as well as actual handson activities with peer evaluation and feedback the videos provided a ton of reallife examples that helped quickly lodge the material into longterm memory which was very helpful i am looking forward to the next course in this series	4
really disappointing the slides contain a lot of paper references that seem to be of high quality thats the reason im giving it  stars and not just  but the course itself is bad it covers many algorithms but so superficially that you learn nothing and there are not enough programming assignments to really allow you to get any intuition on the conceptsi would love to see this be turned into a course week specialization in itself and the professor sure looks like he has the knowledge to fill these  weeks but as a single course over  weeks its not good	1
great course exceeded my expectations by far	4
not as i expected more readings than practicesexercises seems more target on traditional statistics than machine learning	1
excellent introduction of machine learning for engineers	4
concepts are very hard to understand even with some background knowledge in statistics	1
starting it now	0
a good place to start of your entry to data science you get to know what data science is what are the tools used and get an idea of what can be done and cannot be done the course even walks you through installation of r rstudio and git it introduces version control system using github too	3
after the excellent first course in the specialisation this was quite a disappointmenti realise that the subject matter in this course will inevitably involve abstract concepts and subjective opinions but i didnt really get the way that casey was presenting the subject given that there were quizzes and assignments to followthats not to say that the videos arent interesting but given their rambling style they would be much more useful as reference material rather than driving the course in my opinionmany of the questions in the quizzes felt like theyd been added simply to make them up to the correct number some were so loose that you could write any answer and im sure youd get a markalso id say not to even start this course unless you have a clear idea for a game the assignments require you to produce design documents that are tedious going on impossible to write without some firm rooted idea to start frommaybe if you really want to be a game designer then this will be the course for you if you are doing the course out of curiosity for fun or to learn how to control unity id give it a miss	0
a great course a great instructor worth your time	4
good but not so deeply good	3
the concept of the course is excellentshort videos quizzes activity the execution is extremely poorthe short quizzes often do not emphasize the elements focused upon in the video or ask questions addressed in the next video not the one just viewed or address issues that are not raised at all in this particular course but issues from other courses in the specialization one is penalized for being late with assignments and must shift to a new session if one is late the weekly tests are absolutely ridiculousthey ask questions requiring the application of concepts which were barely covered concepts which were not reviewed or which require real world knowledge which cannot be assumed for someone who has no experience in this field	0
the course contains basic informations on neural networks at a quite abstract level it is not enough to easily understand them without a prior preperation in mathematical details the quizzes need strict computations based on a detailed knowledge but usually the course does not prepare you for that the lectures sometimes sound babble and cannot explain even easy thingsit is usually impossible to get the minimum of  in a quiz these are only those who have previous knowledge that can pass it the first time they take it they do not need this course though	2
the capstone project is interesting but requires far too much time compared to the other courses and to what is announced	1
this course means well but with very little critical thinking required it ultimately communicates good intentions over solid content	1
this course helped me in a very turbulent period of my life i now know what i truly want to be and this course helped me on the way to discover such thing	4
i was pretty disappointed with this course firstly the course did not seem well balanced meaning that some weeksparticularly week had a lot of materials to watch and really felt like it was two weeks crammed into one and then other weeks barely had anythingsecondly the exercises seemed unclear poorly thought out and not really helpful there were many errata that really should have been fixed in the beta iterations of this coursethirdly i really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithmsfourthly the scaling section was also a major disappointment while it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic gradient descent i think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classifiers work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using sparkfinally given that graphlabdatoturi was just acquired by apple i question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as all the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist	0
maybe a good course but you need to be an it crack to be able to install the software and make it works online help does not help irritating usd lost i dont recommend this course	0
may be there is a technical glitch in answering the questions of daily assignments while selecting options of the question type select all that apply 	3
poor course saturated with an instructer that uses big words and does not explain many difficult ideas and take for granted that the leaner knows a lot of probability and statistics	0
very very entry level information	1
great course worth the value	4
very fundamental but the instructor is tiresomely talkativefor example when he talked about examples he compared each two numbers again and again what i want to is the logic to find the maxmin number not  is larger than everyone knows it  he compared every number every time it is boring i will not choose this course if there are other python courses open at this time	2
i love the scaleup part of the course it gives me a great insight of upscaling of solar cells but in general the course is lack of content in depth i would prefer a more hard core course with detailed explanation of the working mechanism of solar cells	2
the easiest and knowledgeable course	4
very good teacher more coding exercises would improve the course	3
i feel that the lecture material lacks proper explanation of the key concepts but the questions in quizzes are good although the lectures should have been more conceptual rather than theoretical	1
it was amazing very interesting and well explained unfortunately i could not do the quices without paying the course which is a pity i would have rather done the course first and then decided whether to pay for the certificate in any case i learned a lot and this is very useful information i will use in my phd studies regards	3
the lesson is really boring  and the lecturer just reads the slides and there is no any interaction on the slides or explaining on the graphs and meaning of sentence just read it through i am enough of this kind of lesson	0
many bugs lecture content does not cover topics required to complete the assignments assignment instructions are not written in a clear way	1
could have been better it was little boring when this type of course should be super exciting	1
first the instructor assumes that the students know so much background knowledge when the students are expecting to learn these stuff in the course i also feel that this course teaches students to memorize steps needed to accomplish certain operations in galaxy without explaining why it occurs	0
a lot of reading material is unavailable link does not work or it is behind paywalli also found the videos lacking for example there were  important tips and only one was given before jumping at next topic	1
extremely repetitive with little to no visual interest needs to be cut down to about one tenth the presentation time there are no visual representations no exercises and no interactivitythis is the most repetitive mooc i have ever taken and ive taken a great many	0
really great course really delves into the methodology behind effective teaching in a global classroom	4
not bad	2
the course is a bit outdated and i am finding it hard to stay motivated knowing there are other more recent courses the topics i think are still relevant but the tools are not i am looking for courses where there is hands on development that you follow with the instructor and i did not find this here	1
theres no support from the staff the staff is completely absent in the recent discussion forums it seems they have abandoned the course few months agoyou have your assignments evaluated by only one peer and that doesnt protect your final grade from wrong evaluations	0
i think the way it is taught is not very insightful the lecturers clearly just read a script and make it difficult to follow they assignment questions are often hard to understand most importantly there is very little about the actual mechanism behind pricing financial instruments instead they just state the formula	0
the audio quality of a lot of the lectures are quite bada number of the slides seem to be unorganised at times with repeating information making them confusingwhile all the information seems to be presented it feels like it could be done better with more time spent preparing and recording the videos	1
the course content is interesting and well laid out the lack of contact details for course queries is concerning as is purely being assessed by peers who may not follow the grading guidelines very well providing no feedback etc	2
a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library	2
awesome course	4
the false comparison between religion and soul beliefs cloud the validity of the course maybe the intent was to only show the worst case soul beliefs then shoot them down however at least to me the instructor seemed to extrapolate some beliefs to all beliefs	0
this is the best way of learning the language was easy to understand	3
the course contains some interesting insights on writing a scientific paper what i like about the course is that it is given by graduate students but this is also a drawback sometimes the material seems too simplistic	2
i have not been satisfied with the theoretical content	1
excellent course content but very poorly designed quizzes more clarity is needed in formulating questions since different pages have different values for the same data sets even on the same website such as the world bank indicator datasets and it will be difficult for students to get the right answers	0
a big improvement on the first course still the material is not enough or you should have to do small exercises to prove that you understand the material but progress is there	2
yet another good course that is ruined by a peer review requirement dr singer is a fascinating person to learn from and i am glad i took the time to pursue the course	1
questions are really stupid and predefined answers very unclear	1
a very informative course i learnt a lot	4
not bad for refreshing your memory as in my case  i already received the information while studied in academy and new key principles but overall memory was shady and needed to be refreshed but to speedy for a newbie in the area pace could have been slower	2
topline introduction	1
the course was fine i would have rated it better if there were more practical examples advice and reallife situations rather than so much theory	2
this one is just a warm up for the data science specialization	2
amazing class learned a lot starts from beginning and you end with information to build your own machine learning solutions recommended	4
this course was pretty okay id say i did learn several new things and consider myself introduced to the world of python unfortunately as a brand new programmer it was at times hard to keep up there were a number of elements that werent sufficiently explained during the lessonsassignments presumably because we should have a basic understanding of coding alreadyi guess if this is the case some outside studybackground research may be necessary at times the instructor was actually relatively helpful though the forum format makes for lag in help time meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while againoutside studyresearch required overall as i said i learned things yay this course is for the very patient however and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few	2
this course is the worst one in this specialization the notations are ambiguous and the quizzes are poorly designed	0
very intresting	4
very net and clear yet so basic	4
i have enrolled in this twice but cant see the course content every time i click go to course i get directed to the description of the course where are the lecture videos and other course content	0
money hungry greedy wont let us complete quizzes without paying shame	0
short but relevant very helpful for extracurricular study	4
i donot own a mac nor a imac and hence i wish to opt outapologies	1
i have lernt a lot about the history and tradition of middle east from this lesson which is good for my major for i study arthistory	4
the subject is interesting but the explanations are a little confusing may need more diverse reallife examples to relate	2
great course content was clear and precise i would have loved to learn more recipes for kids	3
this is a very basic course if you are already a software engineer you could zoom through this entire course in an evening if you are not a software engineer and dont know what things like github are this class could be useful	2
i loved the teaching the video are great and the examples too but i almost did not program the course is too easy and i feel i did not practice enough	2
i didnt find it very usefulit maybe useful for professionals just starting work but if you are in a managerial or leadership position struggling to manage work it didnt seem usefulvery basic tips and tricks to manage life	1
overly academic	1
this is a totally theoretical course this actually does not help to build a quadcopter from the scratch it should have been mentioned in the introduction i am opting out the lectures did not seem appropriate for the people without proper background not satisfied	0
nice tour guide to machine learning	4
based on impressions after module quality of lectures just dry material from books not engaging repetitions videos in reading materials and in lecture sometimes feeling that it is waste of timequizz questions are hardly connected to lecturesdisappointed and discouraged give a try to module  and will see	1
course assignment requires knowledge that is not discussed in the course various inconsistencies throughout the course week s material is not really helpful and i had a feeling that the instructior just wanted to wrap up the course and didnt really care if the material is appropriate poorly written quizzes	0
this was my least favorite of the classes  the lectures ere not informative and far too lofty the style class the plot class and the setting class all had detailed concrete teachings whereas these lectures were too airy most of them consisted of authors chatting with each other the assignments required real craft however and it would have been helpful to learn those skills in the modulesfor example one assignment asked us to describe a character in a setting while they were not actually there  say a divorced nurse in a hospital not once in the lectures were we ever taught how to do this we watched a series of author fireside chats and then people bumbled through the assignment i really wanted amy bloom to just walk over to the board and draw a character and say this is a woman shes divorced shes middle class she tends to get very angry when things dont go her way or whateverand then draw out a list of how her internal states might manifest in the world around her  she throws things shes disorganized she writes mean notes in the patient chartsi wanted her to teach she seems to think we already know how to do things like imply a characters state of mind through action i mean for a beginning writer its helpful to just make a list of details about a character  where theyre from what they like or dont like what sort of flaws they might have and so on we did barely any of this it was assumed we knew the basics of characterization but most students did notsome of the other students frustration and confusion came out in the peer review which was a bad sign	1
this course was not interesting compared to the others in the specialization the long section on crowdsourcing seemed very unrelatedunnecessary	1
has interesting ideas and approach to forming a structure way of analysing a problem the module does feel a little thin in content and perhaps should be combined with exploratory analysis	2
excellent course everyone who is interested in knowing about and mastering learning should take it	4
great advice o writing best practices done with humor and memorable quotes	3
this course was well planned and dynamic the professor extraordinary and presented all the topics in a way to make them even more interesting	3
thought it was too easy to be its own course 	2
instructor was boring	0
the assignments were very hard to understand the course videos were poor	0
quite boring a lot of propaganda against drugs sometimes data is presented in misleading ways to make the harm from drugs look greater though if you are new to the topic you may consider to take the course as it contains some useful information	1
course design is pretty uneven in pace engagement and expectation setting the interactive segments could be better also the core content feels like a hodgepodge of different sources thrown together to support the professors lexicon	2
too short lecturesthe study material is not properly defined only entire books to read as referencethe taskstests are all literal parts of the books to complete no understanding of the subject is motivated but memorizing and tiring reading of books without proper directions	1
we are given inadequate information in the videos and no other resources to write a program required to use methods not covered in the course	1
very good course all explanations are clear and too powerful for understandingtwo stars because all tests you can submit if purchase certificate	1
very interesting and clear specially swirl 	4
video after video of lengthy lecture with little variation its a long content dump with just two peerreviewed assignments if this is the best online princeton can do count me out	0
i could not finish because videos were stuttered  even with bigger bandwidth  and as a consequence i could not finish the course and the exercises in my limited free time therefore only  stars is the problem solved now  cause i d like to resume the course again if thats more successful now i would start the next parts of the specializationthank you for an answer	1
the capstone project has been getting delayed since jandont expect yourself to complete the specialization	0
too easy	2
important topic to covernice course	2
interesting and fun	4
overall i was disappointed with this course in the end i dont think it was any better than any of the free online tutorials out there the instructor spoke so quickly in the videos he was nearly incomprehensible the explanations were incomplete at best and most of the time amounted to nothing more than type this now type this im well aware that the only way to learn programming is by doing it yourself but if i pay for a course i expect an explanation of how things work under the hood i was looking forward to taking the entire ruby on rails specialization now im not so sure	0
this course deserves no starts there were no instructors answering the many questions raised by the students there were no explanations for wrong answers and so no opportunity to learn i was helping other students understand the assignments and spent extra time grading submissions as no teaching assistants were available to helpthere were a couple of very good teachers in the specialization however the structure is critically flawed and your time would be better spent studying on your ownavoid not just the capstone but this entire series	0
it would be very useful for teachers teachertrainers etc they must go for this course	3
very good overview of different software management tools	4
its very cool to learn  favorite subjects of all time at the same timei will do my best for this course	3
i am absolutely satisfied with this course thank you andrew professor and coursera	4
starts off slow but it soon becomes quite interesting and informative some parts were quite vague though so dont expect anything too in depth	3
congratulations this introdutory course is useful and recommended to anyone who works or has interest in the subject	4
the material in this course is very interesting and many of the musical demonstrations are extremely helpful i am glad i took it however much of the most interesting material is poorly explained i would loved if fewer ideas were covered in more depth the quizzes were for the most part poorly written and only somewhat correlated with the presentation of material in the lectures so there is definitely much room for improvement	2
the content is important and the course goes through a great extension of the nlp topics but the methodology is bad the video lectures are often overcharged with many different varieties of a processing method that is not well explained the quiz are often not well related to the lecture and the assignments are badly explained and theres no much documentation related to them comparing to andrews ml course this one is really bad	1
this course mostly about how to use plotting libraries in r	0
it is a great intro course with very rich information about hardware security but just as some other students have mentioned the difficulty level of each assignment is not well balanced and week  videos are out of order	3
better to provide real life case study example that shows how people using a particular system can really be more productive than before	2
very very interesting course with a very inspiring teacher many thanks	4
good and very useful tips kept simple and easy to understand for everybody however personally i was looking for a more advanced content	3
good curse the issue is that it was way way too short and i felt its content is the equivalent of a week and that more could be said about it again otherwise good course	3
very baisc and uninteresting	1
this is mostly a sales pitch for the professors book youre required to purchase the book for the class	0
after the second week i droped this coursei thought it will include excel and economics knowledge but was very wrong	2
this is very much a primer i was hoping it would go into more detail than it did but i did find it a very helpful overview	2
the assignments were easy at the beginning but hard at the end	2
very helpful and interesting i like it	4
it was painful to work through the videos at first place for more than one reasons very linmited i would say insufficient and inconsistent use of background data diagrams equations symbolspointers on the board to support what was been talked about it felt like a plain reading of mathematical expressions and descriptions as a consequence i had to completely rely on the www to learn the topics covered so i could do the exercises if that is how the standard of tutoring is to unfold for uol global mba program to which this is a foundation i would seriously reconsider my decision to go for i have been into a mooc ucl and regret to say this course quantitative foundations for international business is a big disappointment hope someone listens and th	0
it is great for citizens students however the speaker uses such a little hard vocabulary to understand for international students as me i really enjoy in this course thanks	3
explained negotiation in an interesting and engaging manner easy to follow and its quite addictive	3
great ideas to improve the technical knowledges to scrapping web data	2
good course for someone seeking to know fundamentals of digital marketing	2
jumps around doesnt put anything into real world examples	1
really great course	4
i enjoyed this course i signed up because i like movies but really this course is about the psychology of memory it uses movies to demonstrate its key pointsits not a difficult course to complete the content is manageable on a week by week basis	4
very helpful information i could use more pointers on how precisely to do the intervention phase  more practicals thanks	3
id pick  or so really the applied nature of the course is nice if you have a project in mind and to see the programming you learn in action without it it might not be worth it because you could learn a lot of the sas programming for free from sas itself using their beginning programming coursework offered online in fact potential students may consider taking the sas programming essentials course before taking this because you learn a lot about the sas coding framework that comes in handy for this class	3
last labs contained errors or at least missing commands but in a way it permitted to face issues and resolve themotherwise great course	3
i am disappointed in the quality of the lectures in this course theyre too summarized  too quick and they lack the thoroughness required to accurately convey the intuition the student needs to comprehend the lessons taught when i have to spend a significant number of hours watching lectures on youtube to compensate for the poor quality lectures offered in understand financial markets i am left wondering why i enrolled in the specialization i think coursera needs to have a conversation with the professors at geneva university about the need for prerequisites before allowing students to enroll in this specialization	0
great	4
this course is suitable for beginning	1
reproducible research with doubt is important but videos and what it is discuss are not appealing and beyond that what are worthen are the projects i did not learn so much from the videos but by myself though the forum is very useful	1
average course not too good not too bad	2
very helpful	4
great introductory course which gives a more nuanced view on eating everyone would be able to understand this and start to cook by themselves would have been nice if one week would have been dedicated to some myths like the protein shake or gluten free diets which are very much debated	3
one of the best lecture series for beginners like me some of the statistical concepts should have been explained better but once you get past that you appreciate the logic in the trading system	2
great course i learned a lot discovered new music and the way mr wright presents the content is very good	3
misleading course nametitle was expecting a course on using excel forums were cluttered and not monitored often	0
i really enjoyed the assignments and i was impressed by the teachers track recordbut the lectures were difficult to follow and i still have no idea how to get started with nanotechnologies after this course wish there were more details on wherehow to get started and practical examples to support it	2
listening to tucker balch talk is a pain he keeps repeating himself not much content in the latter half of the course	2
great content and by the end of the course you have a full fledged frontend website working	4
very nice course the best algorithm course in the world	4
the resources werent organized enough to be fully accessed with ease	2
please include christopher laurence nyabulegesi for mcf or advanced on fa ourses as well invite me for internship whenever there are opportunity to grow and develop the knowledge you gave me during mooc course	4
if you dont pay the fee to get the certification you cant do the assignments 	2
this is just blatant propaganda for the eu its like a big commercial im surprised that coursera allows this tripe on their website awful	0
i found the course useful and learnt some basics around software product management	3
good course the only major drawback is the requirement of graphlab which doesnt allow the student to fully understand the applications using real world software just recently dato the company that owns graphlab was purchased by apple and you can no longer buy a commercial licence to the software despite this users cannot use graphlab for commercial purposes therefore rendering the software completely impractical for professionals the specialization is designed to help you get a job see capstone yet the software currently in place is limiting	1
overall good some of the projects were a tad light and there were some bugs id like to see fixed but good	3
the professor is so slow i have to have him at x speed when listening to his lecture and am still falling asleep i am very interested special theory of relativity but i ll just get a book will be faster	1
very basic course probably wont teach you a lot of new things	1
it will be better adding examples related with engineering cases this is for technical people in any branch of engineering	3
dont have the certificate to certify that ive undergone the course it is sad the content of the course is good however without the certificate it feels like all my efforts have gone in vain please look into iti would like to receive the certificate i am willing to pay for it but i dont know how	1
this course gave a comprehensive overview of what is going on and where the rules come from in seo it also makes clear however that one should take this course once a year since so many aspects are changing permanently i learned a lot and i will sure take it again in a year or so	4
good course for beginners	3
way to basics just to much explication but nothing actually to implement or to do	0
last assignment was painful poorly described instructions outcomesoutpu the grader was opaque and largely mute	2
this course is a good introduction to health informatics and medical standards i was searching for more information about fhir but it was great anyway	2
not the quality i expected the capstone project should have been little more challenging and something new	1
it was amazingly done but sadly it is not up to date any more	3
the course is agood review for engineers ill recomend you strongly	3
sorry to say that this is the worst coursera course i have ever taken and ive taken quite a few the instructors did not do a good job at explaining how to use wordpress they didnt explain how to use wordpress to make a website that looked more like a website than a blog they didnt explain the difference between wordpresscom and wordpressorg even though they mentioned them both they talked about hosting but didnt explain how to do it they mentioned hosting on bluehost but didnt give any instructions the few tidbits of information that they did give about using wordpress were so brief with no examples they mentioned jetpack but didnt say what it was they didnt explain what benefit adding the social media icons would have or how to link them and on i could gothe only good part about this course was the last section where they had guest lecturers some from coursera  those were all excellent	0
it is good for nonenglish native speaker  it is not freei liked most the additional material	1
the course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration the course seems rushed there are not very clear explanations on certain areas mostly i had problems completing the assignments based on what ive learned during the lecturesthe previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something here the problem was using the spark api and understanding things which werent explained in the lectures also not all the areas of the assignments were describedi am sure the course will become better in time	2
despite of been a interesting course i find it really hard to pass it in my opinion previous knowledge or r should be required	1
professor and course are great however i feel that there werent enough practice questions to bolster our understanding of the material and the lessons were spread too thin	3
this is a good introductory course however the quiz questions and over dependence of graphlab are off putting the instructors share good insights about the need and motivation for various ml techniques i wish there was more support on the project using pandas and sklearn graphlab is immensely powerful however not adopted in industry making it hard to apply the learning in real world	2
i think that a lot more that could be explained and taught in this course i would have preferred if some qualitative and qualitative risk identification and assessment were taught and also solve good examples of risk response methods	1
very good course the videos explain the main topics providing immediate actions to daily activities	3
really love the course the teacher was really good and have a lot of knowledge in the area and is quite easy to understands	3
the course was very clear and interesting	4
completely not what ive expected too theoretical without examples and explanations	0
i think the exercises could be more deep	3
lecturer is very monotone and isnt engaging course also focuses a lot on the history when it would be more relevant to look to the future it is peer graded which is extremely unreasonable people do not read the submissions fully or fully have the knowledge to be able to grade someone elses work people also have different standard which causes a large variation in grades grading rubric does not include areas for where extra research has been done either	0
great course great assignments and pace loved it	3
it maybe early to say since i am just mid way week  but so far it has been great thank you coursera	3
i liked this course very much	3
it is a good general overview about recruiting but i would like more information about staff planning as well how to forecast the workforce needs	2
the content is helpful in learning to use the camera and understand terminology but it is somewhat if not totally a false representation of interaction with the experts there is absolutely none some seems repetitive from course one	2
the course is great but i have problem with the assignments as they all have to be in parts and i cant get why we only submit last part as if it is right the others is right also i didnt like the assignments system in this course but the course and the assignments itself were great	2
great course even for people who are not students	4
assignments are ambiguously phrased and full of inconsistencies and typos the last assignment does not provide feedback at all it mainly felt like sitting in a lecture theatre getting a fragmented overview of the lecturers work while never gaining a real handle on the wider context or what would have happened if an action hadnt been takenhad been performed differently there was not enough further reading and no discussion of other peoples work  such as a dissection of how a company might have arrived at a product we can actually identify in the wildrather than learning how i could tackle any project i now know how to work on very specific examples of projects  if anything was to deviate from this id still be cluelessoverall the course feels haphazard and badly prepared	0
this course couldve been better by the inclusion of more examples the lecturer is very monotonous and sadly i see no discussion forum for this course in addition to that whenever i tried replying to the comments the reply button turned grey and nothing happened i had reported to resolve the issue but nothing happened the issue persists it could have been done much better specially the lectures thank you 	1
wonderful course for nontechnical people	4
ive always been a fan of the beatles this course gave a great perspective of the beatles phenomena from a musical and a business viewpoint	4
the course was pretty good maybe concepts were illustrated too general and briefly not in details but maybe this course is just a warm up for people who are not specialists in those fields nevertheless it was quite fun to listen the lectures and thats why course went pretty fast i only regret that theres no free statements of accomplishment	2
well explained videos but very short course only  or  short videos per week	1
lot of talking lack of visual templates etc	2
the course gives some ideas about time management however it takes more time utilising these methods of planning checking the plans planning extra work and risks than actually do the workit is impossible to multitask lets go back to monotask	0
great content but animations are annoying	2
it provides me with exercises to practice but some of the videos explain things awfully or just not at all others are good the discussion boards are helpful i just wish they didnt talk as much about what something is as opposed to how it works many videos often dont show any code or very little which makes understand syntax difficult	2
the course is fantastic by practicing with the assignments i improved a lot in python programming i am now confident in doing data cleaning and manipulation in python	4
this course is great i enjoyed every minute of the lectures and the interviews too it was very motivating and informative i learned a lot from it to teach my self and my kids too barbara did a great job throughout the course i recommend this course for everyone at any age	4
i think that presentation slides should be offered to students these slides will cointain information that is given by the expositor also it is possible to offer a toolkit pages in each module to faciltate teaching	2
its a course which is designed to preview the other courses it could easily be eliminated	0
hate this class i wasted  bucks on this crap and now i am stuck taking it	0
i paid to get a certificate and did achieve good marks on the tests and assignments up to week  if memory serves and still i dropped out before the end of the course why the tests trip you on little bits of trivia as opposed to assess your understanding of key concepts another course learning how to learn has the best tests in that regard the modules are too long when you do this in addition to working it becomes a chore the assignments instructions are tedious  confusing as for the assignment themselves i couldnt shake the feeling that i was a test subject with data being gathered in the back not what i signed up and paid forso its a pity and i do regret having had to stop attending this online class i was attracted to the topic i enjoyed the personality of the host but all the above made it a chore	1
great course 	4
great learning curve	3
the video lectures are confusing and quizzes too	1
content is not well organized videos are disconnected from one another explanations are not clear spreadsheets contain vast information that is not explained anywhere it is been quite difficult to follow through the course and i bet many students are giving up	0
excellent course highly recommended	4
instructor is outstanding course material and programming assignment are wellcrafted	4
frank friendly and motivating excellent	4
this is a very good place to start if you want a career in data science i really learnt a lot and currently using it my data analysis projects i would recommend this course to any one who likes to work with data	3
its amazing ive learnt so many things and i havent even completed the course yet as it goes it becomes more and more interesting compelling to complete it and maybe even go for a certificate	4
the scoring of the peer review was not really measurable of your effort	2
informative good introduction to basics in project management might have been helpful to have more case studies	2
it was a great experience and fun i strongly recommend it to everybody who want to get solid knowledge in web and computing at all	4
the course is too short it seems that many materials are removed	2
course provides a simple introduction to ruby unlike some others it requires you to install ruby from scratch no vm with preinstalled components and the final assignment requires you to do a project from scratch as well no template this is good and provides a much more real learning experience than some courses however the bad things are the deadlines are way too strict the lectures are way too long and seem to have an unclear structure technical problems are frequent a lot of stuff remains poorly explained	2
thoughtful	4
if data could be shared it would make the capstones project more practical	3
i cant believe this course is aimed at people with no experience in building a website the videos are actually slide shows and use too few screenshots had this been my very first introduction to how a website was built i would never have progressed any further than these lessons much more indepth information is necessary including step by step screenshots of various processesterrible course	0
this course did not live up to its potentialthe course should be retitled as an intro to statistics not learning functions and visualizations on exceli still have three stars because i at least picked up some useful concepts from it	2
this g	0
its a good course and the contents are very helpful there are important components like negativity bias and lovingkindness meditation however i somehow feel it lacks a more systematic or scientific approach since lots of the materials goes on with a free and open discussion that very much depends on subjective views or feelings of selected individuals who joined the discussion take another example what is love session clearly depends an individuals own view it contradicts triangular theory of love and the lecturer doesnt even explain why	2
course is a very good intro to machine learning it was taught at a good pace with clarity	4
thank you for the great class series i am looking forward to other classes offered by this instructor	4
introduces the basics of arduino and c programming not a lot of content but gets you ready for the next course in the course specialisation	3
its a great course for the students who want to learn more about mechanical engineering and how some machines work	4
another awesome course with dr chuck even if you have no previous programming knowledge dr chuck leads you gently into it his explanations are extremely clear and precise and hes so fun looking forward to the next python course 	4
it was really boring hard to keep watching the videos and doing the activities there was some stuff that could be interesting but you can find it somewhere else	0
too much mathematic approach	0
very insightful	4
well explained content though at times the presentation felt a little slow solid coding assignments that do a good job of reenforcing the course materials a couple small topics werent explained clearly but overall its been a very informative class thanks for the knowledge	3
this is a good introduction course butbut i dont think its worth to pay  dollar for a couple of hours of lectures that you can finish during  dayim really disappointed with the fact that its not possible to go through quizes and assignments without payment what if i cant pay right now but will be able to pay at the end to receive my certificate i should go through the course again and i will be late for all assignments so will have to wait for another course session veryvery inconvenientand yep coursera reduce the effect of learning with not providing quizes for those who are auditing only	2
sometimes need more words in tasks so it can help understand it better	3
a very slow and dull course lost my interest half wayprobably a course for nonnative english speaking students	1
its a good course but i expect more	2
great course loved it thank you for the stories and for the hard work to deliver this great course the best ive seen 	4
there is no one participating or collaborating here theres no way to get help	1
great course with a great instructor highly recommended	4
extremely good course only drawback is that the assignments cannot really be checked independently	3
good review of the theory but course is outdated given the number of events in the last  years that relate to the information provided in the course  particularly as it relates to attacks	2
great teacher	4
you need to pay to participate in the quizzes stay clear there are free alternatives out there	0
very detailed and practical	4
only for introduction more materials shoulb be supplied	2
avoid this course like the plague terribly taught no support problems only vaguely related to the course material and designed to force you to buy the manual for the course the next classes in the specialization get even worse with the student forums full of students who cant get any help though the grueling process of installing oracle pentaho etc on a personal laptop i was fortunate to have experience with the tools would have never managed to finish the course just based on the terribly taught material	0
learned a bit but overall it is literally not worth the price of admission i think that this course could be offered for free and maybe the others are worth paying for hope that the rest of the specialization is worthwhile	2
interesting and well structured easy to follow some videos were a bit too long but the concepts were well explained everything was clean and clear i enjoyed it	3
this is an extremely basic course machine learning is built on mathematics yet this course treats mathematics as a mysterious monster to be avoided at all costs which unfortunately left this student feeling frustrated and patronized so much time is wasted in the videos with arduous explanations of trivialities and so little taken up with the imparting of meaningful knowledge that in the end i abandoned the videos altogether the quizes were basic largely based on recall of rather than application of knowledge as were the programming assignments nearly all of which were spoonfed with the tasks sometimes being simple as multiplying two matrices togetherif you are serious about machine learning and comfortable with mathematics eg elementary linear algebra and probability do yourself a favour and take geoff hintons neural networks course instead which is far more interesting and doesnt shy away from serious explanations of the mathematics of the underlying models	0
a lot of things to learnbut the programming assignment evaluate program does not help in finding mistakes	3
lectures and other material just dont cover the information needed in the course project majority of the learning has to be done outside of this course in order to pass the course projecti cannot recommend this course anyone who is not deeply familiar with the topic already the course project is truly frustrating	0
the exercises need more work done if the students are expected to actually learn this stuff	2
lecturer is downright boring and not engagingcould had used more realworld companies as examples for teaching including pictures but its the same bland slides again and again	2
good content that helpful for your other studies	3
its a good course for those who want to learn ml with graph lab	3
good but gives the very basics	3
the caliber of questions in the quizzes is quite advanced i would be fine with that as the challenge of writing correct html is a good challenge however much of these questions were not covered in the lectures or the required and optional reading learning the correct html tag syntax is not intuitiveone has to be shown examples if no examples have been covered how can a quiztaker be expected to create the proper tags this strikes me as bad pedagogyin order to answer the questions and prepare the requested page of html tags it became necessary for a beginner such as me to research elsewhere in order to answer the questions in that case i began wondering why i was taking this course rather than just reviewing the many free html explanations on the internetfurther the very general response to the submitted page of html gives me no help when i am simply told something isnt right and i should review the lessonsagain i expected better feedbacki found this course to be fascinating from the lecture point of view but abusive in terms of quiz expectations i was going to take the css course from the series but now i plan on looking for this education elsewhere	1
very interesting and demanding course however is very long  weeks in comparison to other online courses and due to its length it should provide a certificate of completion	3
presentation has to be better	1
the professor teaches by reading the slides and does not even bother to explain the concepts the course contents might be interesting but now im dropping this course because they are not explaining any concepts but are just giving facts to memorize	0
fairly good videos explaining the material probably worth  starts however the written support material should be improved imho the video should supplement the written material ie it should be possible to learn the material only by reading this is not the case so frequent pausing of videos and making lots of notes is needed if one wants to commit this course to longterm memory	1
as a nonfinancial person i liked that it is a good clear intro finance however i wished there was more reading content available on the site to go more into depth on the topics	3
topics were not taken in depth and enough clarity i tried hard to learn in the course but lost track by the end of week  and the peer assignment	1
a little bit too muchmaybe five week is better	3
no doubt about it this course is about to change your life	4
very poor that in order to submit any exam i have to purchase the course when i can download the book and learn as well	0
its not professional as that one created by penn uni named pay attention  which is unavailable now and i dont understand why has it been removed from coursera	2
an excellent course drs bruce and carlie really made the course enjoyable and their combination was crucial to my enjoyment and knowledge gained thanks so much for the course and the huge amount of work you must have put into it	4
very little depth i dont recommend this if you dont already have background in statistics or r i really didnt learn anything i mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects	0
very interesting class very useful	3
its a bit too simple all of this there is not enough depth in the course no way i would give   for such an introductory material the best part of the course are the additional resources lists the good and bad examples are useful as well but they are all too simple as wellthe videos are good quality though and there is some information that is useful if you are looking for a simple introduction  never seen an interview  have no experience with public speaking  have not taken many oral exams then this is for youi rate this at  stars because i was expecting more a lot more mastering really more like not completely failing	1
decent enough but this is a heavy subject and really it is not that interesting although clearly necessary i feel maybe it could have been organized better to make it more interesting also reading some of haldey wickhams book he deliberately keeps this part of data science away from new learners as it can be a bit dreary so my recommendation would be to do some of the other courses first	2
good information but not good for people lacking background knowledge lecturer reads off slides and gives very little supplementary information	1
i really enjoyed this course ive learn a lot	4
great introductioni think the swirl tutorials are particularly helpful for learning r in r	4
the course stays a bit superficial	2
i am a phd student in genetics so the background material there was review from undergrad courses obviously some people who are not biologists will need this background i do wish however that the statistics intro was more applied and covered a better intro and application to the why	2
good course for beginners but those with higher levels of nutrition knowledge will likely  find it way too easy  find that the recipes actually contain rather unhealthy ingredients eg always avoid buttertoo unhealthy and  find the lack of vegetarian vegan lowcarb and other dietlifestyles discouraging	2
the view on mobile app and desktop is so different when i posted week two work an old website id built populated i didnt have time to even notice it it did not meet assignment rubric and once my classmates reviewed it and moved on i was forced to switch sessions because nobody was left to grade any resubmissions that should have been visible in the mobile app for a week i kept searching for the problem and the mobile app said all complete the desktop assignment tab finally revealed my issue	2
emily and jake are the best but the course was too difficult for me	4
well paced very informative challenging enough	4
the course is very abstract	1
i would expect less mistakes in english it would make a better impressionthe course content was wellthought and wellbalanced the professor had a great way of presenting the material but the english language part needed some editing	2
was expecting more videos than readings	2
i have learned many useful things from this course thank you very much	4
quick intro of html css  js but not deep enough to get more pro on it	2
its good information but not quite what i was looking for in terms of actionable steps that i could take to engage with stakeholders from different countries	2
it is good but you have to study by yourself using different material as the video contents are not enough to understand the subject	3
instructor not as good a big fail when you need the nd lesson in order to complete the st programming assignment	1
very low level  im sorry but this cant be even considered a good intro to htmlcss im going to stop wasting my time watching thisno chllange in the assignments or questions   more of an overview of the basics then the basics 	0
speaker is not energetic or something lacking makes it boring	0
its too easy the exercises and quizzes are too simple to solve once can easily read  chapters from book in a single day and can complete this course i feel that the duration weeks for this course is way too long the concepts discussed could have been easily understood in  weeks at max also i think the fees is high for such trivial concepts	1
i found significant improvement of my grammar after having attended	3
i am just loving it thank you for all your effort	3
overall a very good course for the vast majority of it i felt that information was explained carefully and there was a good balance of challenge and support	3
this course dedicates an entire week to very simple topics the lectures could use some serious editing too to help you understand what i expect im taking this at the same time as im taking whartons week  entrepreneurship program ive also taken whartons intro to marketing course which i highly suggest over this course the quality is dramatically better getting started agile meets design thinking is a university of virginia course that also is a great example of how these courses should be done im hoping the next courses in the digital marketing capstone are much better so that im not watching a lecture and counting how many times the professor pushes his glasses back upon the plus side i did like the engagement this course encourages by forcing you to go to other websites  accomplish things as well as review your peers work i wish your peer reviews had less of an outcome on your grade though in my experience many people did not even read the instructions on how to review the assignments	1
informative	3
this is a very good course to learn some basic expressions and most of all get a good first grasp of chinese pronunciation however i found the course structure quite repetitive over the seven weeks every other module is structured in the same way which fruit do you like apple banana orange then the week after its which sport do you like basketball cycling running for a sevenweek course this was not challenging enough but its a good start	2
its a very interesting topic but i had to rely on a text book to understand it i struggled to understand the lectures and reconcile it back to the quizes	1
usefull introduction course course material is clear	3
this is one of the very useful course	3
not all apps wok on my devices so i was unable to do assignment apple annie was difficult	0
pretty helpful  but  weeks is an awful lot of time for the content being taught in this course	3
why should i waste my time listening to someone reading a book to me	0
not well prepared course	0
professional communication should be clear correct and effective the course has helped me to improve these skills congratulations to everyone who took this challenge	2
terrible instruction in the videos and unclear directions id avoid this course if possible but its required for the specialization new videos should be shot and inspiration taken from more instructive and interesting guides like the cartoon guide to statistics by gonick  smith	0
good basic introduction i appreciate that it looks at both jquery and javascript css media queries and bootstrap allowing the student to compare the two	4
interesting and excellent for knowledge integrated	4
this course is only good if you have basic knowledge regarding materials science and this course is highly based on research papers and research domain  overall a good course 	1
this should not be its own course as it would be pretty useless if you were doing it on its own without doing any of the other courses the end of course project literally being just to make a github account and download rstudio could be quickly covered in the first week of the other courses	1
scope for improvement nevertheless thank you	1
the lectures are pretty great engaging the assignments stick with the lab exercise the forum pretty active	2
a decent introduction to the topic	2
awesome on line course	4
in some ways good but deeply flawed the assignments were weakly correlated with the lectures and no explanation was given for correct answers or for incorrect answersi believe the authors would have benefited greatly from getting outside feedback from an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student rather than each other	1
content is not well adapted to a digital format	1
this is the worst course so far this should be a  month course or the course descritpion should be changed to make sure you have some statistics knowledge	1
slightly repetitive of classification course with no real usecase value except lots of math	2
fabulous wish this course had been available when i was in undergrad this course will be very beneficial when i am writing adult education curriculums as well as working on my masters	4
very good introduction into the iot and embedded systems	4
this course is not prepared as well you see several video with animated presentation and typical vocabulary termsit is not for beginners because in course you didnt find answersit is not for pros because in course you didnt find interesting materialhope that instructors can change course to better	1
missing substantial amount of information and lecture	1
very poor teaching extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested and what is not they assume that you know terminology and concepts that are not taught half of what they show you are told to ignore obviously smart and capable researchers but teaching the lay person is not their strong point	0
just following a text book without an added value from the lectures	0
why were we talking about money managers and hedge funds what does that have to do with data analytics for business i never saw the connection and they never explained it	2
this course was a waste of my time luckily i found out after wasting only  hours on the preview this course apparently requires a level of probability knowledge i dont	0
i find this course very informative but at the same time the videos seem pointless all the quizzes are on the suggested reading material the videos are quite cursory almost an afterthought	2
the course for me was very simple and basic i recommend it to students who makes their firs steps in this area	2
great course	3
the course is good but not as splendid as the first in the specialisation the difficulty has apparently skyrocketed while some videos from week  seems to be missing making the lectures difficult to understand	3
nice introductory course for database management assignments are challenging enough for beginners like me but i like that if im already investing my time into something i expect to learn something in return this course gave me that kind of reciprocity course would benefit from radically different approach to videolessons reading from powerpoint slides which are written in the same manner have identical structure tends to become tedious after a while professor seems nice and knowledgeable but a bit more relaxed andor engaging approach would be beneficial to many oh and peerreviewed grading wherever possible should be replaced with an autograder thats not a critique though not quite sure if its even possible with this kind of material	2
this course does not allow us to answer the assignments without purchasing the course instead they should allow us to do so	2
the professor isnt that great and really difficult to follow high speed english pronunciation not obvious the assignment was also really similar to the	1
couldnt fiish the course not hard but exhausting and not interesting	1
poorly designed course which tests people on things that are not taught	0
it does not let it show as completed unless you purchase the course and take the quizzes quizzes cannot be taken unless you purchase the course	2
boring	1
nicely covers the content for even a new learner its a good source of knowledge i am impressed by the course content and teacher	3
this course started out with an ambitious goal for a mooc in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project i found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on i still made an attempt to watch the course content but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance two stars for quality video production aside from that i was unable to find much value	1
this was an interesting course however there were bugs and errors in most of the assignment materials which really impaired the learning experience since much of it was reduced to debugging the course organisers code also the rd and fourth sections including assignments seemed to be rather small and to cover very little material with little or no supporting material moreover course staff were conspicuous by their absence on the course forums a stark contrast to the abundance of support provided and material covered in aerial robotics	1
its boring	0
taking the learning how to learn class was one of the best decisions ive made in the past ten years regarding maintaining my skills current and relevant to my professional life in high tech i used to fall prey to a sense of being perennially behind regarding the amount of technical knowledge i need to master for my work since my university days my modus operandi used to be repetition and brute force ie more or less crammingafter this class i now have a set of tools i can actually relate to i can use them proficiently to learn smarter retain information better and foremost understand what my particular cues are if procrastination gets in my way again i cannot thank drs oakley and sejnowski enough for the deliberate pace of this course they carefully pared down its content with luminously clear explanations often delivered with a downtoearth approach sprinkled with humori sincerely hope that this small message of gratitude will encourage whomever is on the fence to register for the course by the way by requesting a certificate of completion i felt that i hadskin in the gamei had a deadline to honor whether tired or pressed for time knowing that i had paid the modest sum for my certificate encouraged me to make time for myself to go through each lesson carefully and learn the special vocabulary associated with these new toolsvery best wishes to all you will be so happy you took the time to go through the classsincerelycatherine von dennefeldnapa ca	4
course has very good content and well structured however it lacks more details on the mechanics under the hood functioning of blockchainsthe practical assignments are not adequate propose more exercises that goes up in incremental content and difficulties and allow students to get more practical insight upon how a blockchain really works	2
good for under standing basic concept	3
week does not seem enough for a crash course	1
very basic and not especially much fun or challenging	1
nice lectures and tips to clean your grammar and write better essays	3
not holding my interest sorry	0
great course	3
a very high level approach these courses require a better math background and far more concrete explanation since the student has a passive role and lecture mode is on	1
the course sped through the coding portions while spending a lot of time on the theoretical side of how the internet works overall a very helpful overview but i would have liked to spend more time coding	2
quite useful and hard	3
the material is very interesting there a a huge number of quizzes over poorly explained or not at all explained models which would still be an interesting challenge if the models themselves had better explanations this has been the most frustrating coursera class i have taken not because of the subject difficulty but because of the lack of adequate resources for working with the models	1
unfortunately this is one the worst paid courses ive taken on coursera the material is very brief the assignments are poorly explained and structured as with all the other sections in this specialization there is no feedback for professor or tas which is veryvery frustrating	0
defiantly the worse mooc i have taken does the specialisation need such a long introduction	1
awesome course	3
as a beginner this cours is greate	2
lacks of structurereferences multiple toolsprograms that we wont detail in this course  why are they talked about then im almost finished but am struggling to find motivation for itafter having done the great html css and javascript course the contrast is hard to cope with	1
very boring	0
more like a  to  close to  the main problem for me with this course was the assignment i found it a bit unclear the instructions are clear but the way to go about completing the assignment was not the last assignment we had in course  was very specific and even had a video specifically on how to complete the assignment and why each step was important we were given an example as to how to perfectly complete the assignment to extract the maximum knowledge from the course in this course that aspect was a bit lacking	2
content is actually very good i can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems projects and assignments are quite useful and i can expect to use skills i acquired in my day to day work however the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do selfstudy i spend tons of time on google search reading docs and go over other peoples post on various forums in order to find the right waysometimes optimal way to finish the assignments i understand and accept that selfstudy is very import to master things nowadays but i really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like meid rather spend time watching  more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspectstopicstipstricks than go over lots of docs and posts i wont deny i learned a lot through this course but i believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available if the majority of course is spent on googling whats the point to take it	1
just amazing and helpful thank you from the 	4
id like to have practice tasks during the course not only the final one	2
interesting subject the presenter is hard to listen to though	1
it was very dificul i think yoou need to improve the example you give the the students and be more interactive	2
good content from a high level would like to see more information from the clinicians point of view for example what are they doing in the system as a pa	3
very little of use in this course a lot of academic mumbo jumbo that is totally useless when confronted with the infinite investment opportunities the student is presented with a number of time consumingwasting formulas to apply to the decision processif one actually used those formulas one would still be waiting to buy the first stocka question from the week  test will demonstrate just how useless this course isthe situation you invested to maximize your wealth over a one year period you are eagerly anticipating the returns after the first monththe question what part of your brain is being activatedwhats wrong with thisfirst of all who invests in order to make it big in one year you are trading if that is your goalsecond who gives a flying fig about what part of the brain is engaged what am i supposed to do with the answer how does this in the least help me make better investment decisionsim done i was going to take all the courses in this specialization no more waste of time and money	0
this is not a course  each session is  mins or less	0
i found the lectures interesting and thorough yet short and to the point	3
i like this course it focuses on grammar lexis specific of journalists work and principles of journalism	4
excellent course and pretty good job done by andrew ng who not only mentions different techniques used in machine learning but also explains the intuition behind them in layman terms	3
the most informative and most structured out of all creative writing specialization courses so far thank you	4
i still dont have a grade and need help	1
this course would have received five stars but there was no discussion forum and the weekly assignments lacked clear explanation i feel that instructor could have gone a little deeper into the subject matterhowever i liked the laid back instruction style the assignments were perfect for beginners like me im looking forward to the followup course	2
great course which covers most of regression topics and important thigns such as lasso regression or ridge regression	4
i really like professor bob and his lecture is great however the order of how things were taught is questionable to me in my opinion students should learn basic knowledge about finance first and then go to the topics like diversification besides the quiz were not well designated i dont see the point to answer a question like when was fannie mae created	3
theoretically good course could have been made more interesting by including more examples or cae studies	1
this course was not as good as the first course i found myself typing codes mindlessly a lot and feeling the guilt that im not learning a lot from the app im making because there is too much coding going on and its not clear whats more important the final exam was too easy almost a joke and it didnt help me figure out if i actually did learn something by typing out all these codes i would like more lecture snippet of codes and explaining what they do and have us fill out part of a code by thinking through as oppose to typing out the whole thing	2
easy to follow and wellpacked with good information and tips but i would like to see some kind of quizfunction along the course to test the knowledge ive been learning	2
if you are a beginner in oo not recommend 	2
concepts are fantastic but the material developed to deliver the course is short of expectations especially from a university excel sheets do not match what is demonstrated in video lectures lots of confusion around how to complete tasks quiz answer options not being correct and missing excel spreadsheets eg video lecture says to refer to accompanying excel spreadsheet but no spreadsheet available also judging from past discussions by students some inconsistencies around formulas being presented in video lectures versus assignment questions could have been a great course but the inconsistencies have made is very disappointing	0
nice intro course a little light on content but i still learned a lot	2
although it delves into key elements of trading where it really matters course lacks explanation on some subjects course progresses monotonously	2
there is some good content on creativity in this course thoug it barely addresses problem solvingdo something different assingments were an interesting ideasome content material is missing including the link to a text that is needed to answer a quizz which will influence your final gradegrading standards are weird maximum grades are to be given to assignments performed in public as if things done in private arent creative there are better ways to have someone get out of their comfort zone assingments request that you be photographed or filmed and there is no disclaimer that your photos or your privacy will be protected if you are an introvert or simply a person who values privacy this is not the course for you	3
it was a very good course  simple but had all essential components would have loved it if there were one more simulation for a different situation throughout the course rest it was a great learning	3
too much introduction	0
good intro	2
highly inspirational clear to the point just sorry that assignments are only for fully registered course followers	3
basic but not overwhelming like some other courses ive taken very good	4
compared to the other courses this one is kind of boring but learned some origination of dogs 	2
this course is very basic	2
the videos and documents are not balanced with the quizzes the quiz questions are sometimes verbatim sentences from one book with a missing word  which i find hardly a test of acquired knowledge the course must rise above only a few definitions and rough concepts most of the videos hardly offer insights  they last only  minutes and cover a few of those definitions this course has a lot of potential but in its current format and content it was a disappointment	1
thank you for valuable knowledgei am sure this course will be helpful to me in my future lifethank you again	3
thank you very much karin and lorraine for your course it really helped to understand more about epidemiology but more importantly about the mathematics behind them im sure going to put in practice all the knowledge you gracefully displayed on those lessons thanks very much your job is of really high quality	4
quite a repetition of fundamentals of graphics design the first course in the specilization	1
i learned so much and the format was easy to follow	3
this course is simple but it should give you an idea what this specialization is	4
i am really satisfied with the class i love your teaching techniques thank you really	4
very helpful explained well im a business and ma lawyer and i found this course extremely valuable to skill building	4
a good introduction to programming in general and in relation to web apps a lot of focus on just a few problems mainly graphics manipulation but a good starting point i think looking forward to learning much more in future courses	3
empty of content	1
great course but can be somewhat dry at times yet highly recommended	3
the teacher just read the powerpointand his voice makes my sleepy	0
this is an excellent course for those who have forgotten the basics of punctuation	4
a bench mark for easy understanding of programming	3
i found it very interesting and helpful for my personal and professional development	3
to me every mooc by martin odersky is pure gold i guess this course underwent a couple of refactorings because i didnt have the impression that the topics and sometimes the assignments throughout the  weeks followed a clear path this is just my impression though i might be wrong anyway great mooc and lots of fun i can totally recommend it	3
i attempted to take this course because i really wanted to learn more about the us constitution and how it applies to my daily life i made it to week three before i could no longer keep listening to professor amar drone on and turn a  minute lecture into a  minute lecture with filler words tangents and lack of structure professor amar is very knowledgeable about the constitution and i dont doubt his credentials or accomplishments however with out an outline slides notes structure something anything this class is just a talking head that is painfully hard to pay attention to if youre an auditory learner and prefer the old school pretentious ivy league lecture hall format this is the class for you	0
im sorry that im going to sound harsh but this course is uselessit touches so many different topics without going deeply into any of them all you get is a basic knowledge about all things cyberthe recommended readings are all over the place the video captions look like theyre just a basic speech recognition and like nobody actually proof read them theyre full of errors lecturers say one word captions show a completely different word plus theyre full of spelling errors kadafi regime in libya reallyyou can get the same amount of knowledge by reading two or three wikipedia pages dont waste your time on this course	0
basic content that do not explain how business models are applied in digital world	2
an excellent overview of a hot and powerful field interesting and relevant examples some typos remain but most are minor and easily discovered	3
could have more information about concepts i would say this is a very very high level look at game design concepts are not explored very much for example level design is mentioned i can sum up the whole lesson in that as game designers create pieces and level designers put those pieces together in interesting ways how to actually do level design what makes a good level etc are not explored at all there are some generic tips like make sure it is balanced it should be interesting and paced right the most value of this course is the documentation to write down game ideas inthis should all make sense by the fact that the course alone is  weeks long  week of the machine learning course is about equal to this whole course	2
the content is essentially a subset of the information available in the free tutorials on tableaus website and a pretty small subset with that the total length of the course is less than most of the moocs i have taken have for one week	0
use very specific environment that cannot be used in practice in the the real worldfor a much better course use uc san diego versions	0
sorry but he puts me to sleep no emotion	1
professor didnt do a good job on explaining the theory he moves too fast this should improve so that student who has lessweak knowledge of math can pass the quiz if you are not a math student dont take this class i was hoping to learn about how to program to control the machinerobot but it turns out that this is more focusing on the theory instead i would recommend to take another course of mlbig data from uci instead	0
of the courses ive taken through coursera introduction to ancient egypt and its civilization is by far my favorite my interest in ancient egyptian civilization began in early childhood and has stuck with me ever since im in my forties now dr silvermans lectures are very engaging and highly informative always leaving you feeling excited for the next lecture he really knows this subject	4
could do a better job of teaching more of the fundamentals involved in the programming assignments	2
while the task of summing up a lot of information in a minimum sized presentation is always a very difficult task the structure of the material presented was not optimal this in turn made it difficult for me personally to actually connect the weekly information presented with the overall meaning and the objective of each module the why and how of most modules fit to the meaning we are forming up to week  the point i am leaving this class is not evident last some of the questions contained ambiguities that could not be reasonably clarified even going back and reviewing the material of the specific segment thank you for the offered class in any case	1
i did not like the teacher but i did like the course material	1
excellent specially for english teachers	4
great introductory course however there are some antipatterns taught eg mongodb unbounded arrays also there is no testing frameworks used  and this is a big missing element for modern careers in web development	2
i got bunch of info in this course i believe i wont get it in organized and net way anywhere else and i recomned even learn angular from anywhere else take the course	4
this class was actually about responsive web design not information design the two are in no way synonymous information design is about the visual display of information in a way that aids comprehension responsive web design is about creating different interfaces for different device form factors im not sure how a professor could possibly mix up the two but he didthe only reason im not giving it  star is that there was in fact some interesting info about responsive web design if coursera would change the title to responsive web design instead of information design id give the course  stars	1
very bad because you need  persons to evaluate you every week and often this persons is not educated or gives a score zero for all  so having to recourse or leaving without convincing reason	0
i wasnt that impressed i did learn a lot about business types and copyright stuff but it seemed like the assignments had nothing to do with the course material	2
i want to give  stars but there is only option for  or given that its geared more towards wanna be managers in this field i would have expected lot of case studies and links to additional material for individual reading plus a mini write up or a project at the endfor moocs to compete with a degree program or an onsite instruction few of the things i think that are needed areinterviews with industry practitioners which is a big plusinterviewspostings from people with similar background as the  of the mooc students of this program who made it this motivates the students from dropping from the middle of the coursespecilization programslinks to additional articles that the students can read at leisurewriteupproject as assignments that the students can pursue and publish not necessarily for grade but as a mind joggerone more thing that i think should help not specific to this course is that the student with the best grade should be offered one free course and think this will motivate the students to complete the courses	2
it felt like amateur course the volume was very low and was missing videos	0
relative quick and easy but with valuable lessons	3
its too short i think it should be a part of a course and not a course itselfit is a repetition of concepts and examples from other courses by john hopkins univ	0
course was to easy and nothing new in it not as the description that it has algorithms  times faster than google	1
i loved the course it was a joy to take and i had fun learning and taking it 	4
the course is helpful but incomplete it does not mention dashes and colons it also misrepresents the usage of semicolons i have seen the idea of using a semicolon followed by a transition word taught before but i do not think i have ever seen it done in published writing in my entire life it strikes me as being pretentious something to be discouraged	2
good introduction into the world of microbiome the only drawback  not enough of this precious welldelivered information	3
r programming is seeming difficult more hour courses are required to be initiated for making this language better learn among scientific community	2
useful course with nice projects	4
some swirl tests  dont work because of parameter method in qplot function this parameter is not realy existed in this function now	1
mostly talking heads pretty good information id like it faster more dynamic talking heads could make this more watchable very generous of the world bank to put this together	2
somewhat useful but suffers from what seems to be bad planning and a general lack of focus	2
bushee was fantastic ittner was fine but not as entertaining as bushee	3
progfun and reactive programming was better	2
great and absolutely well done	4
great course	4
its a very good introductory course of bim but the reading content can actually convert into lectures which could be more attractive some of the assignments contain outofclass information and brought me a little bit of trouble hope this part of content could be included into lectures	3
the course modules are too long and at times what the speaker wants to share gets confusing	0
very basic everything in here can be found online on a blog youtube video or a book dont waste your money	0
really disappointed with this course to the point im quiting in spite of having paid for the grade it reminded me of my days at the university where i found being a great scientistengineer didnt mean you were a great teacher and this is the real problem even things that should be easy to grasp are difficult to understand just the opposite of prof bill boyd who makes learning a joy because of this i would only recommend this course if you already have an intermediate level in python	1
this course is not at all beginner friendly really hard to follow the assignments and the lectures if you do not have a programming or r background	1
this course has been utterly brilliant i almost cannot describe the important things ive learnt the new techniques to try and the confidence its given me i am hoping to study a masters of research next year however its been a long time since ive done any formal study this course has given me the confidence to believe i can be successful in my studies as well as the techniques to make sure that is true i would recommend it to anyone who is considering a new course of study after a period of nonstudy this course gives you the tools and confidence to study anything it is utterly brilliant	4
personally i dont recommend this course i really need to learn data warehousing for my job and i have no problem with learning by doing this course gave me basics but the learning was very stiff i think its just to theoretical here	1
this is a must learn for any learner and i feel this should be taught as part of school education to children	4
i wish they spent more time on the content of videos and less on the silly effects and second intro and outro sequences practically every question of the final comes wordforword from a book not assigned in the module readings and not available for free to students for them to study i wont be taking any other courses from this school if this course was an indication of quality	0
the challenges with questions and demos are very usefulhelps for a good understanding	4
this is great i am so happy i started this course they should teach children from a very young age how to learn	4
nothing like described not easy for non native english speakers as describedextremely misleading	0
for those who have been working in subjects such amlcft anti corruption and other similar issues is a great complement that add value to that fields	4
gosh i hated hated hated this course nothing to learn here you will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoeveri often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them also i really didnt like the fact that the course is centered on caret a shortcut package to do stuff fast before doing things fast i need to know what i am doing finally the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the coursesthe worst course i have ever taken on coursera	0
awesome  i am glad to have this opportunity and got a chance to learn from the very learned person like him 	4
great course	4
the speaking style and body language of the instructor was quite monotonous when teaching the content for the most part of the course it felt like the instructor was just reading the teleprompter without blinking for several seconds he did not attempt to teach the students in these videos it could have been much better if he had used better presentation tools and shorter sentences	1
only catered to the american healthcare system this course was not mind numbingly boring as hell	0
elementary and entertaining with some unique and creative prompts	2
short informative and exciting course	4
very poorly structured explanation and examples were not very helpful should revamp the course content and video lectures specially the steganography part	0
great course	3
as a professional instructional designer i can attest that this is the poorestdesigned course i have ever seen regrettably i paid for the entire specialization upfront and i cannot get a refund or even a coursera credit for enrolling in a different specializationbe aware that the faculty who is the instructor of record does not participate in the course the video lectures are poorly done including errors and misstatements that could have been edited out but it appears that no one bothered to edit the raw footage before uploading itthere is not so much instruction as an overview there are no coding exercises until the final assignment which is poorlydescribed and requires the student to selfteach using outside sourcesthere are app specializations in coursera that appear much betterdesigned look elsewhere	0
this course seems patched together the volume isnt consistent even within videos some videos  slides are great and full of information while others are just long periods of talking with one word or phrase on the screen and none of the information put in written formsome of the questions occur in multiple practice quizzes also there are misspellings in the quizzes finally one quiz marked a question wrong and then in the comments noted the answer was rightfurther some of the videos seem to stretch out information to fill time	1
this is not a start at the end of the course you still cant use python and even the tools dont work properly	0
quizzes are extremely subjective and hard to pass couldnt find direct relation between content and questions cultural barriers might be to blame	3
the presenter in this course is hard to follow and does not have good slides she often does not put her bullet points or lists on the slides  i am a visual learner and she does not provide enough on screen info she is really uncomfortable and makes it really hard to listen to her talk she struggles through the entire presentation which is just super distracting content is good though	1
good for the beginner	3
great lecturer it is perfect in tandem with the mooculuss textbook httpsmooculusosueduhandouts	4
there are issues with submitting assignments failure to process submission in courserapeer reviews may not be the best solution as we have to wait a long time for our work to be reviewed	2
not quite the excel actually relevant to industrial requirements had to leave the course mid waythere are better excel da courses out there concept presentation was good though	1
lot of typos and glitches as well as typing in equations being really difficult	1
very very basic course looking forward to advance version of it	2
if one has taken the algorithms  and  course by profs sedgewick and wayne this course will be a disappointment and waste of time	0
this course was excellent the teaching material topnotch and with excellent pedagogy its amazing that the course authors offer a statistics textbook almost exactly covering the course content for free the idea to combine r and statistics is right on the money too thanks to this one can learn  skills at the same time with statistical analysis letting you practice coding in r and r helping you visualise your statistics the lectures are divided into small easy to absorb chunks and the teacher does an excellent job explaining the material giving very good examples and analogies to help the students understand concepts the exercises and assignments are fun to complete and the course offers a flexibility in how much time you spend on it per week eg there are nonmandatory exercises to do	4
lovely structure of the class combined with illustration interview and cooking is the best part of this classthe contents are very helpful as welli really recommend this class whoever wants to know about nutrition and change your diet habit to healthy way	4
a little be difficult for me	0
this was a great course i am retired so i do not want extremely high level courses with quizzes that are very hard to pass i feel this course was respectful of learners intelligence without going over the top well presented topics made it enjoyable also liked the interactive map learning and tech tips thank you	3
the professors did no prepared the classes they make so many mistakes in the video lectures and they also laughts in the middle of the course and they send a nonprofessional feeling to the students the content of the course is very good but the proffesors could really do better	1
its such a awesome course for beginner tutor is also teach very flexible way you can learn more in angular if you register it thankx	3
a little heavy on the biology side	2
professors very hard to understand and videos dont have the best editingalso extremely math heavy lectures being just math formulas without a lot of real life applicability ex the assignments where you have to project a logo or cube when the program gives you the location corners in a file which will never happen when you use your camera finding that position is a prerequisite of the entire program	1
drlakshmanan does a great job covering the wide range of products google has in the cloud space with real handson working examples the lab on ml with tensorflow was particularly exciting  this course helped me get a clear understanding of the space each tool occupies and when to use them the introductory handson labs got me started and now i feel confident i can build upon them on my own thank you drlakshmanan	4
the first week or so feels inconsistent and oversimplified after that when you get into the actual content it gets much better it then ends on a peergraded assignment while the assignment itself is creative and fun to complete ive never been a fan of peergraded assignments so early in an introductory course load	2
difficult to understand due to her very strong accent and poor audio meaning i spend  of my effort trying to make out what shes saying as it turns out all she does is read from the slides no additional insight nothing this makes it boring to hear and she comes across with no personality although a quick ratemyprofessors search tells us a very different story a real shame since people seem to really like her at any rate after one week of this course and not seeing any improvement ive decided to call it quits	0
i really like the main information i got with this course but i think that it was too basic i never learned any programming language before this course but sometimes i felt that the teacher was going too slow on explaining somethings	2
great course series that forced me to take some steps design docs that id normally skimp on and in doing so realizing their true valuethroughout coursera id love to see more instructor involvement in the courses the  peer review system is a double edge sword on one hand i never felt i had an instructor looking at my work but on the other hand where else can you get constructive critiques on the internet overall great experience star for feeling a little bit on rails and not feeling the instructor involvement	3
poor grading system based on  peers subjective points of your week analysis assignment even if you digested all the materials and received  on quizzes all weeks you will have to repeat taking this course endlessly at first i thought i did not analyze thoroughly so on my second session i basically rewrote the whole assessment followed by samples passed students gave me also making sure i covered all the points the instruction asked me to cover peer gives me  or  point for writing persona with little detail i wrote  words persona with stories and demographic of my target audience because i am  points short or so i have to take this same course for the next round session for the third time wait it it reaches week  resubmit my analysis that is now edited for  times there is no clear guideline format or even sample provided but the grades are left to the peers some pass with less than  word analysis with a lot of charts and pictures i did as well but wasnt lucky at my first round so i developed  pg analysis all in words to make it look like a true analytical report didnt pass again i do not know what this instructor is looking for as a form of assessmentanalysis paper and only those who are lucky enough to meet sensible peer graders pass waste of time waste of money no one wants to spend lifetime to get a certificate especially when one knows what he or she is talking about	0
the course content is really poor i do not recommend this course if you are actually interested in learning anything	0
this course has contents that are repeated multiple times throughout the course i think entire course could have been covered in a week or at most two weeks	2
certificate is expensive	1
sadly this course is at the high school level at the most very disappointing to see it listet here as a university course	0
the information is good but is going too fast and i dont feel i have learned much from it im on week  and im still not sure of how to make my assignments in a proper way the quizzes are very confusing too and sometimes i felt frustrated	1
not a very informative course a few hours worth of reading up specs that i can also find on wikipedia	0
no engagement from faculty if you have questions regarding anything in the course no one will answer them unclear and incomplete instructions for assignments overall probably my worst experience with coursera	2
awesome course really helped me understand the angularjs framework and single page web application in general	3
kind of hard to follow explanation is	1
too simple seems like a introduction for mba class	1
solid course makes the case both for acting ethically and for rationally choosing how to carry out those ethical activities i had heard most of these arguments before and was already convinced by them but if you are looking to figure out how to do more good with your life it is a good course	3
a good introductory overview of data science grounds you on what you can  cannot do with data science i find defining the question really impactful teachers were enthusiastic and the brevity of the course gives it good appeal for beginners who want to get their feet wet	2
this course supplies comprehensive material on various avenues of machine learning and is a great place to start ml	4
the course is well structured and the contents are exposed clearly probably one of the main problems of the subject wind energy itself is it covers many disciplines aerodynamics mechanics and machinery structural design electricity and grid connection financial aspects so a week course had to be quite superficial to cover each of this aspects minimally for my expectations it was a little bit too simple but mostly the quizzes were too easy the hints after the quizz questions were solving the questions and avoiding the beautiful part of the quizzes playing with the formulae and interiorizing itall in all it was a nice enjoyable course but sadly i feel i didnt get deep enough in many of the treated subjects even for an introductory course	2
the content seems to be excellent regarding what is presented but sadly the sound quality is rather bad sounds like an ageold valve radio with a lot of dropouts and professor daphne is an agile and therefore less disciplined speaker which lessens the understandability of her speech in conjunction with the poor sound quality furthermore especially for me as a nonnative foreign english speaker it is very hard to follow and now i am at one point in the course that is flow of probalistic influence where she explains a concept without explaining what is meant with the used underlying notions flow and influence which makes me difficult to understand what is going on that means in my point of view that the slides are not sufficiently prepared although im very interested in the topic i am asking myself after the first view videos if i should continue or drop because my cognitive capacitity is for me to worthful to use it for the decoding of badly prepared and presented material ok my decision heuristic in such cases is use the hammer not the tweezers therefore i have dropped please improve the state of this class from beta to release then i will come back	1
the course presents the topics in a nonlinear manner it should be called learning graphs with c	2
great insight into how to track and review metrics	4
the previous  courses was pretty good but the assignment is tooooooooo easy and this course has lot of redundancy which i think it is not necessary but overall i think it is good	2
very practical and the contents are good but the quizzes are just too simple and the analysis on the cases are not deep enough	3
extremely basic please put that up front in the course description	1
very useful	4
the capstone itself option  is very interesting but there is no really graduated evaluation	1
it was fantastic	4
very informative course but without certificate after spending so much time and efforts it should provide a certificate 	1
the support by the mentors could be much better because of the missing support i was not able to solve the assignments under windows with octave i had to buy matlab it seems to me that the course is very difficult to complete without additional sources 	1
interesting content practical exercises and well structured	3
a distinguished course for those who want to put their first step in learning the fundamentals of r programming in the unceasing journey of data science 	4
the teaching has been concise and to the point which is good but not so good for a few difficult topics also ive been experiencing video lag and audio stuttering while streaming the videos so theres that	2
the professor makes it easy to follow i appreciate it	3
good course	4
way to technical	0
a new generation of mooc with rel available for free on the web as teaching ressourcesalready got that elsewhere	0
thoughtprovoking	4
great course	3
good didactics and content	4
poor english unfair assignments 	0
too little information and too basic	2
much of the code is outdated im using python  fix this and youll have  or  stars easy	1
a bit slow but good for someone with zero experience	2
good course	4
compared to the other coursera course i attended this one is by far the least useful one the instructor is super brief and his slides are mostly made of a list of acronymsi would not recommend it until they make some serious changes to the content and presentation of material	0
worse than the first course i expected something that is not academiclike explanation which i cant find it hereplease bring back those explanations style similar to the first course	0
lesson   no longer available via pclesson  no longer exist to do via pc on internetsugggested  it has been removed cannot go ahead without having the lesson  information	0
its a neat course	4
really insteresting lecture but it is still hard to understand for people without psycology background	3
this is a very easy course i would definitely recommend it to any beginner in html	2
probably i am biased by just having followed edxs minds and machines compared to that course the lectures here are superficial and not very engaging this becomes especially striking for overlapping topics between the two courses also the quizzes are way too easy and you can try until you get it right this makes the certificate virtually worthless although you can pay for it	1
thank u for giving a attractive lecture and it really heip me for future research	4
this course is extremely basic its planning is best summed up just show them a memo have the participants write one and boom success that one small peerevaluated exercise is not worth the fee	1
great	4
the other modules that i have done in this specialisation have been great the lecturers are insightful and the courses have been at the right pace this particular module was flat to say the least i paid  to learn a small amount of markdown syntax and the quizzes and the weeks didnt even match up	0
this course feels quite weak especially for the paid course for these reasonsmodels leader as mentor coach etc ctfar model which are given in this course are given as is with no references on how they were developed authorship and how good the results of application arealmost no just one external references for reading to better understanding course materialthe amount of material about  hours of video  quizzes  discussions and  assignment doesnt feel like its a months course more like a oneoneandahalf weekno references on topics described as hard during the course for example identifying your values which would make this topics less hardno instructor interaction on the course forum i dont know if this should be like this or not but it still feels badhowever the final assignment is good and practice oriented	1
first week and last week were pretty useful with some good tips from the videos the other weeks not so much	2
too much contents in short lectures hard to catch up and to understandthe tests after each class are poorly designed most correct answers are the first choices	1
excellent course though i found it difficult the exercises that required listening to students speaking different languages were particularly hard for me probably because i speak only english and my ear is poor nevertheless i persevered and feel i got a great deal from the course i would like to take the next course in the sequence if there were one	3
very interesting course that will help you in designing systems that people will want to use	4
easy mooc for starters	2
as with all coursera courses there is no way to communicate with the tutors which is vey important in such a specialised course the course also requires finishing assignments while needed clarification and explanation is not always provided in the course videos in some assignment a required step was only explained in the following week centering variablesassignments review depend only on peer review when peers in most of the time dont read through assignment completely or open attachments leading to poor grading based on missed information that are actually attached in submissionsalso this course along with the rest of the courses in the data analysis and interpretation need some more focus on using sas and other data analysis tools and the way to present results in a more appealing way this could be given one extra lecture in each course	1
content not discussed in proper detail instructor skims over the concepts its difficult to follow	1
excellent course the spreadsheet analysis was very helpful and i really appreciated the structure of the course nice job	4
great course loved it	4
this course is really bad the instruction is not enough to solve the programming assignment the almost contents arent related to communicating data science result	0
its ideal for beginners the teacher explain every thing very clear	3
great course awesome contents and grading	3
the course are fantastic but  month hard working to earn a cheap certificate that looks false  i cannot present it to my company	0
i really enjoyed this course and i greatly appreciated the didactical approach of prof ng and the passion that he puts into teaching in particular ive found extremely useful the practical advices that he gives throughout the lectures they really add something to the theory especially coming from such an expert the programming exercises have been really nice to carry out thanks to the detailed guiding lines in the exercise sheets i would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested or simply curious about the topic	4
good introduction for people who have never do anything with programming it is really basic knowledge	2
the lectures are just videos of the professor bloviating about jefferson there is nothing academic about this course	0
a little bit too light and not really challenging just a quick view of the language the teaching team does not seems really organized  just a quick view of the language no slide just someone who is presenting code on screen no real support on the forum from the teaching team	1
great teacher and class last exercise was tough	3
my only happiest moment in this whole course is writing this review i couldnt wait to finish it in order to give it the  star rating it deservedwhat ive seen from this course so far is abandonment  thats right this course is abandon ware no questions get answered on the forums asked a question a month ago and still didnt get an answer and the links are outdated links to further documentation dont worki wouldnt recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn machine learning since the instructors use proprietary libraries that need a license to use outside this course thus application wise what you learn her isnt transferable only the conceptual contenthowever even in that there isnt much content for since everything is an introduction here so nothing is quite useful if your on a tight budget and your taking this specialization you could skip this course actually you could even skip this specialization since they canceled the capstone project so investing any money and time here is a waste i can only recommend this specializationcourse if the instructors add a project at the end  be more involved on the forums  update non functional links and finally use non proprietary libraries hence they will need to take feedback from the students and redo most components of this specialization	0
do not take this course  the guy who reads not teaches the course justinnicholas toytama is horrendous hes too lazy to even type out the codes and has the worlds most monotonous voicehe pauses often to read this notes and has  enthusiasm teaching this class if this class is not part of the certificate specialization i wouldnt even pay for this course  gets you further with nick walter or rob percivals udemy course	0
overall its a pretty great course i just didnt find the homework that enlightening though  but i suppose that may just be a consequence of the issues involved in formatting a mooc	3
this course is about good practices for user interface design if this is what you are looking for it may be worth your time just be aware that the production quality of the videos is among the worst courses i have taken in coursera on the other hand if you are looking for a heavy cybersecurity related course i suggest you to stay away from this one unless you are taking the specialization in which case you dont have other choicecontent videos quality practicetheory ratio 	1
i surely broaden my knowledge as i am a beginning teacher thank you	4
the course is good for getting an overall idea of the main topics of finance but not on getting a deep understanding on them	2
this is a great course if you want to hear the questions you need to answer to make a good game design for your game it does not give you the answers but it gives you a road map to followdownside of the course are quizes and peer reviews quizes sometimes have shady and nonclear answers especially for nonnative english speakers assignments grading criteria makes your peers to choose from  to  and  is you did so awesome that youve impressed your peer very much and this is not happening often	3
lecture quality is not as good as other sessions of the course plus the grading system is not upto the mark people evaluating others performances themselves dont know how they are suppose to evaluate grading must be done by professor all other isb modules are far better on course era except this one no offence but its true	1
i wish a more extensive exam was administered i think it was far too easy to pass gives the impression the course was not to be taken seriously while quite on the contrary it was interesting and would deserve much effort	2
very nice but very primary level is taught	3
in comparison to other courses i felt this was a little too superficial for the true challenges of information design still good though	2
this course clearly has come ambition to cover important topics on bayesian statistics however probably due to time limit the lecturers have to skim through the contents without further sometimes necessary explanations as a result the lectures are difficult to follow	1
really a good one for beginners	4
with a grand title and grand introduction i found the course very superficial and gained little additional insight form big history	1
i an very disappointed that duke hits your up for  just to grade the fist quiz which should cost them  this is the fist time i have seen an institution do this i can understand charging for a certificate or for a final project but not right out of the gate i hope that the spirit of coursera is not changing to a pay to play site there are other higher rated universities that take a more noble approach i wonder if all the reviewers paid  day  for this class or did duke recently changed their pricing policy after the reviews	0
one of the best available courses 	4
the course is essentially a selfhelp guide focusing on the idea that cooking real food promotes health this is certainly a message that many people need to hearunfortunately the advice concerning what to eat is less sound let me illustrate this with a historical counterexamplearound  years ago a canadian dentist visited my home country of switzerland where he examined the health and diet of a population in a secluded mountain valley he found them to be of exceptional health their dietbreakfast rye sourdough bread butter and cheeselunch rye sourdough bread butter and cheesedinner rye sourdough bread butter cheese and potatoes along with some vegetables in the warmer half of the year and small amounts of meat on sundayscontrary to four fundamental recommendations in the course these people ate a lot of saturated fat butter and animal protein cheese but few vegetables and had hardly any variation in their dietthey did prepare their own food grown or pastured locally in very mineralrich soil which imparted their butter and cheese with very high amounts of fatsoluble vitamins a d and k perhaps animal foods are not as unhealthy as the course suggests and food and soil quality is paramountinstead of taking this course watch maya adams tedx talk httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgyikacrm and browse the recommendations of the weston a price foundation httpwwwwestonapriceorg to learn what to cook in particular their healthylife dietary guidelines httpwwwwestonapriceorgwpcontentuploadshealthylifeenglishpdf if you still need a selfhelp guide to actually start cooking your own food then by all means take this course itll only take you about an hour	1
best course to get started and know thoroughly the machine learning basics	4
the course poorly understands the scientific method and its main effort is to wield unconvincing critiques of science so as to elevate the status of religion in general and creationism in particular the last set of lectures is also just badly executed a confusing meandering talk that amounts to nothing the course did have a few bright points like the second series of lectures explaining varieties of naturalism but overall the course was just bad avoid this course you can learn much more from other sources	0
the course may be great but the sound of the video is really terrible this is a big problem for me and possibly to other users at the point where i decided to stop watchingplease do something about it 	0
very bad or nonexistent support	0
really enjoyed the course  hoping there will be more chinese courses	4
if you are a beginner this courses assignments will be quite difficult to solve but not impossible nevertheless the course will give you the incentive to try and learn on your own with the help of rforums the coursera discussions google etc i would appreciate it if some things would be explained in more detail a beginner most definitely needs more time to spend on the course than the hours estimated	2
good intro course for a total novice if you have some programming background you will move through this very quickly	2
very useful but i feel in some videos the teachers talk too fast	4
excellent course i find myself going back over my notes over and over there was so much included in this course its hard to remember it all but its definitely worth it	4
this is an absolutely excellent course for those wanting a serious overview of neural networks i would very highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in really going deep in the areai would not however recommended this as an introductory machine learning class for someone unfamiliar with the area	4
lot of external links	2
great introductory course builds solid foundations should have been longer to cover more topics	3
the initial lessons were rather chaotic the idea was good but the execution was not really goodthe significantly improved the quality for the second course so i assume that for a new iteration the it will be better too	0
its very informative but not attractive	2
i wished it to be more hands on more practical but unfortunately is like reading a book about social marketing i am disappointed	1
it could be better if there were more workingpractice examples but it lays down a good overview of the techniques and decision making process	2
difficult as hellwhen you complete it you really start understanding this area but i think due to level of difficulty teaching staff should be a little more activebig difference in difficulty in lessonswhich are easyand testwhich are sometimes incredibly difficultif you want to work in big data field you have to complete this course butexpect hell	3
the course was a bit mixed in terms of its quality	1
it is generally good course but i feel it is just a combination of very little tools skills and ideas i believe it is quite complicate for me to understand esspecial git and github i think it is better to combine this course in other courses where you need it	1
nice course getting into angularjs programming foundations and some very useful tools	4
course starts to be already outdated	1
felt like the teachers werent putting much time into preparation  felt random and disorganized i didnt finish the course  ill watch the csp lectures from stanford instead	1
this course is not designed well	0
very intensive course definitely very well detailed and thorough the tests often rely on paying attention to the smallest details of the lecture which while frustrating forces you to learn its one of the hardest courses on here but also the most rewarding when you finish it	3
the constructs of learning functional programming are very useful and well explained this course is about theory with practice problems which are somewhat challenging using sml as the programming language the only downside of the course is the use of sml which is fine for educational purposes but lacks any real development  debugging frameworks and has no commercial usability beyond learning the concepts in the course	3
very useful and the problem were mind busting and i also want to mention about the forum i had never seen any kind of active community anywhere where peoples in the thirst to help others	4
didnt learn as much as expected about learning how to learn maybe my expectations were too high	1
really informative course the reason why i rated  is because the lecturers read much too often from the teleprompter obviously they all know the material very well but reading it off a screen doesnt feel very natural	3
good course but the swirl exercises and a few quiz questions needed to be updated for the latest version of ggplot	2
very interesting subject i was really wainting for a course like that but with all due respect and aknowledgement to the instructors their is many ways this course could have been an inspiring and exciting journey vincent	1
too basic contenti have not learned anything with this course installing r and rstudio should not be part of exercises or lecturesi hope r programming course will be better	0
hard to understand professor when one needs to read the english subtitles to understand the english the professor is speaking it becomes inherently difficult in an online course also please kill the intro video for each course it is completely unnecessary as the courses are labeled on the left side of the screen good material but difficult to watch towards the end of the course	0
its give the knowledge make me better	3
very basic information could have been covered in full in a ten minute video not very useful given the time and effort involved	1
love it as usual great course good set up and great way of teaching texts videos and fun	4
this course will be helpful for brands  people who begin their journey with personal branding and social media the material contains many detailed personal examples and another great value of the course is in sharing experiences in the forums	2
i loved it thank you	4
cannot believe uci have just very short course compared to san diegidukevirginiacopnehagan who have courses worthing thousands of dollars for free as compared to this one uci have exception course in objective c which is worth the money to be paid but this series are extremely below the expected standard	0
it is quite good course for beginners those are latinlanguagespeaking people you dont need to learn a chinese characters so it is very simplebut i think that these lectures lacks logiccal explanation even in beginning the logical sturucte is undoubtedly important for further learningand quiz are really easy so you can finish this course even in a day if you have a sufficient time i do not think that this course will make someone really spaek chinee in china but this should be recommended for only those are interested in chinese and do not have a plan to go to china	2
course doesnt do nearly enough to bring you up to speed on using mathlab or ipython notebook i am currently learning to program python and a lot of this stuff was well above my headthe quizzes and assignments do very little to reinforce the work and often come down to trial and error i wanted to learn the mechanics of machine learning from this course but it is too complex and presented in such an arcane manner to serve as an introduction but doesnt go deep enough to really teach anything useful id suggest you look at wikipedia or youtube for better classesid like to draw special attention to the quizzes as often theyre on trivia from the lectures and not reflective of the actual nuts and bolts of working with machine learning they as with the projects i found to be a massive waste of my time	1
i had some issues with this course which is why i rated it a first off let me start by saying this is a very good overview of what the cybersecurity terms are but i wish it went deeper into the subject having to pay just to take the quizzes for an overview course is kind of a joke i could see asking for money if you went into more detail information regarding each lesson but just telling me what each term means and then pointing me to a website then asking for  bucks is kind of cheap considering no indepth information was ever given why did you have all of those people that are in the field of cybersecurity just read off a list of terms you could have done that kind of a waste of time for those other people i am guessing that you had to pay them which would explain why you are asking  dollars just to take the quizzes where was the real life experience explain to me the most common mistakes people make with each of the different type of networks as securities that would at least be worth  dollars for some real world practical use i could have easily googled these terms and have in the past i thought it would contain more detailed information about the subject considering is technically an online course	1
concepts covered in quiz and assignments are not covered well in the lecture videos can be much better	2
lot of emphasis on remembering things rather than understanding how they work	2
it was an awesome course with a lot of new concepts to learn i feel the chapters on lists dictionaries and tuples should have at least  graded assignments each to make these concepts more clear through extensive programming assignments	3
i like this course because it not only explains the theory of neural computing but demonstrates neural networks ml with a lot of practical examples as well it enlightened me in the applications of machine learning technologies	3
great course	3
very boring	1
very much a milehigh overview great introduction course	3
i liked the curse a lot however i would consider some more gradings throughout the course not just the few otherwise people lose their interest	3
too easy	2
the instructor is good but the amount of content is severely lacking compared to alternatives	1
awesome course perfect blend of theory and practical	4
i miss a proper buildup from the theory to the practical exercises especially the last quiz i found very difficult based on the limited number of exercises presented upfront	1
i found this course amazingly helpful and informative about the various kinds of foods we eat different facts and tricks and checks are listed out here to make sure that you stay healthy and fit this course makes me want to cook more and not regard cooking as a tedious activity anymore it is effectively explained by professors maya adams and micheal pollen they are passionate about food and the need for everyone to be healthy this is an excellent course and i would recommend for everyone to take this course	4
help on topics is very limited nothing more than instruction videos discussion forums are helpful only to solve assignments there is hardly any input from instructor about genuine theoretical questions	1
some of the knowledge is useful in life but they are not integrated well they let you feel that they are just knowledge but you can hardly connect them with food with daily life or with your health the good knowledge teaching should be like how much calorie we need per day how much food equal to  calories what is the good sample for eating or cooking knowledge is not only formula this course is not that interesting but thanks for the teacher all the same	1
the course provides a good basis for understanding online instruction the videos were informative though i recommend reading the lecture transcripts first then watching the videos as the video slides were basic and didnt really add to the lectures organization	3
i found the videos tough to watch i was hoping for something that would be more practical for nonstatisticians but the lectures mainly devolved into mathematical proofs that said i did learn some from this class just not as much as id hoped	2
too many generalities and roundabouts and little real detail	1
course was not easy to grasp lost interest after the first week and i barely got through the quiz at the end	1
suddenly after taking this course i can not imagine any one becoming a photographer without this essential knowledge these knowledge i now feel is basic to anyone who is serious about making photographs funnny how knowledge transforms us	4
i felt more like i was part of some experiment to see how long i could tolerate boredom than that i was in class where someone was trying to share knowledge with me needless to say i did not make it to the end which is sad because i was genuinely interested in the content the instructors delivery was absolutely monotone and he did not seem to emphasize the key points in any way so i found it very difficult to retain any information or to even stay awake at times	0
doesnt go much further then common sense introduces terms for concepts you probably know just didnt know its a concept the lecturer is terrible his stories or i guess metaphors that are supposed to help you understand and remember things are aweful he takes way too long to get the point acrosssome helpful things are mentioned gives you the ability to distiguish problem solving methods so you may use them as requirednonetheless mostly wasted my time watching this	1
this course is good for someone who has the basic knowledge about chinese language and wants to study more it should be better when there are the sentences examples of using each word	3
i am taking this course as a requirement for the data science specialization i appreciated the concept of learning a platform in which i could conduct bioinformatics but i feel the course did not provide adequate guidance and information the lectures were basically video workshops with a few gems of knowledge here and there i am now at the end of the course but i feel like i learned nothing but a few steps to running an analysis or two  which i could have done for free through the galaxy website itself more significantly its not wholly clear to me why some of the processes were conducted or what explicitly could be gleaned from the analyses my expectations were that the lectures would be more in depth about the science behind the tools available why you would use such tools and when to use such tools i think this course would have been perfect as primarily an intellectual course with a handson introduction towards the end	1
i feel this course was severely misrepresented this clearly not a beginner level class by any measurement and the  hours of expected student involvement is ridiculous a beginner no programming experience should expect to spend  to  hours on the first week alone and at least  hours for each of the remaining weeksi have over  years of programming experience in assembly language visual basic c and c i am clearly not at the beginner level yet i spent more than  hours on the first week mostly due to trying to download and setup properly for the course also there are over  hours of videos in the st week plus  quizzes and a programming assignment if anyone spent less than  hours on week  then that was not the first time they took this classi also am keenly disappointed in the restrictive nature of the assignmentsquizzes having to type  instead of i and you better not have any leading or lagging spaces for instancebottom line i would not recommend this course for anyone wanting to learn java for android programming unless you already know java and just want some intro on android development with android studio and if you are indeed at the beginner level do yourself a favor and start with introductory courses in computer science	0
very basic overview of personal branding	1
a good instructor and interesting assignments but the information presented was quite shallow i dont feel that i learned much from this course	0
found it a bit hard to follow some aspects couldve been explained in more detail	2
its an excellent course very interesting and the presenter is an amazing teacher	3
interesting things about graph algos but i think the content should be more challengingespecially the last two weeks a quick quizz and a free assignment the automatically give full grade whatever the content	1
i took this course as something that would give me some additional knowledge on business and it got me looking into the sources and main themes the instructor talks about more i have so far come away more informed than what i was expecting for sure highly recommend it	3
disappointed by the course content  except for the th weekthe course content is us specific which has no relevance for international students how am i bothered about obama care or other american statutes	0
a very basic introduction good for anyone new to html	2
the course was very good overall but i would have often preferred for the lectures to be more on point some of the lectures contain lengthy introduction and gags which i am sure many students like personally though i would have liked it better if the lectures were more focused on the material	2
good course	3
this was one of the best trainings in this area that i have ever done in my lifei am very grateful to the university of minnesota for the opportunity and initiative as well as the developers of the coursera who are able to disseminate knowledge on a global scalea huge congratulations to all	4
i like the course it is pretty good to learn screenplay butthey need to explain a little some topics that new writers maybe dont understand submerge more in some topics and explain it	2
this class assumes intermediateadvanced experience coding in python so if you are new you are likely to struggle a lot the sql part however was taught from a baselevel understanding of almost  and is much easier for a beginner	4
bad useless garbagethis is the most bad online course ive takejust waste time	0
buddhism conversion course	0
challenging class and welldesigned course for intermediate java programmers	4
very redundant and lacks diversity	0
only part  was partly interesting and usefull all the rest is vain	0
many new things are available to learn i am alrealy a management student but this course help to know me that i dont know anything and i am continously learning many new concept	3
could have been more hands on	2
a little too simple and too broad overall its ok	2
excellent course i suggest that in a few quizzes you were asking to get the numbers off the slides in the video it is very difficult to read the numbers off the video can you instead add the slides in the quiz pdf file all the information required to answer the quizzes should be in the pdf filethe course material was very good the problem sets were very good too because of real life data the rigor of courses was average i can understand why you do not want to make the course more rigorous however it would help advanced engineering students to go through a more rigorous course	3
this is a very good course for getting your fundamentals i like all the content it provides it can be made better on the javascript part where explanations can be made little slower or some more references may be provided to explain	3
very disappointed that the assignments are not part of the f	1
very interesting course and the way the instructors give the lessons are great and easy to follow the concept challenges are also very good because it makes you test yourself if you really understand the concepts or not	4
r programming has solid information and exercises on just that however the videos and sections for each week are not very clearly structured sometimes the end assignment can take many times the number of hours the rest of the content in a week requires id be careful about taking this course while working unless you can devote serious time to programming projects on your off days that stated the course is excellent otherwise	3
very difficult to follow the lectures due to the heavy accent	0
coursera gives universities the flexibility to show their own style of teaching and sharing knowledgei really love this course good projecthowever good course is not only the instructors responsibility but also the students active involvementi rate  because we need more students get involved in developing this course like creating wiki notesextra material to read etc	3
course could have earn my starsmoney money money is not the way to go	0
the lectures did not prepare for quizzesassignments not a class for beginnersit would be better if he used r while lecturing instead of just talking through the whole lecturei got more out of the swirl tutorials than i did the lectures	1
it is theoretical which is nice but more practical example like case study would have kindled my interest to go for the certificate	2
poorly designed and explained you do not really gain much knowledge from this coursei would not recommend my friends and basically others to take this course there are far better courses out there for much cheaper prices	0
the teacher was great and it taught me a lot about web data technologies that i heard about but didnt specifically know	4
this is a good course but if you think better and deeply you will understand that deep inside you your self know this things but maybe you did not do in daily life	1
videos proceed way too fast for complete beginners and things are explained without enough underlying basics plus there is not really enough chance for repetitions in the videos tonal explanations are good except for the green line where you are not told how to choose what part of that tone to pronounce every time overall it could be a great course but falls short because the videos proceed way too fast and without enough repetitions or even practice exercises to be able to remember the phrases afterwards	0
best course in the specialization  thanks team	4
they made this many courses as they can earn more moneyi dont think this course should me taught seperately	1
poorly constracted course	0
contents are good and interesting but speakers english is so low and bad pronunciation that the course becomes almost unpleasant	1
i need subtitles in spanish content is good	3
i really enjoy the food preparation and the important facts about our body about our food intake habits thank u a lot maya	2
great course very informative thanks pwc and coursera for this course	3
i really did not understand this course there was way too much jargon	0
the course was not what i wanted	0
this course seems to have interesting content and presentation but the quiz concerns the materials not covered in lectures or readings be it required or supplementary this is totally confusing	0
this is a great course on research design especially if you complete all the assignments there is definitely something you can learn from this course i mean i teach research design and even i learned new things	4
good course for beginners to get used to the terms of javascript and basic workingunfortunately its not as good as the html and css courses in this specialization the basics are touched upon but i dont feel confident enough to start javascript coding on my own yet more explanation of the concepts is needed as some things are really difficult to understand and you have to search outside the course to understand them	2
i think its a very interesting course well focused on the strategies to arrange an effective communication	3
love these specialization each course is great so farmany thanks to all who made it possible	4
this is heavy material and i suggest it be broken down to two separate courses and the author take his time in explaining the various concepts in much more detail vs trying to cram them within  or  minute sessions i know i wasnt the only one struggling to keep up with the teacher after week 	1
this course changed my life totally cray	4
sucksthe audio quality sucks the video quality is also miserable the topic is good though	0
well structured in the html version of the book are some type errors escaped characters please correct them to help others thanks	3
i couldnt get passed the starbuck assignment i dont really understand why the choose such a bad application of digital marketing	0
i would have preferred that the course andor accompanying textbook contain examples of templates used to manage data analysis	3
this was the most poorly designed course that i have ever encountered whoever is in control of quality assurance was caught napping on this one  the instructors were woeful it was as if the principles of instructional design and adult learning were abandoned entirely there was minimal instruction and i had to rely on my intuition and the assistance of a study buddy to work hard to complete the course if you are completely new to website design as i was prepare for a steep learning curve as you will be spending many hours preparing and organising your info  the title is deceptive and misleadingann melbourne australia april 	0
excellent mooc thank you very much	4
nice lecture needs to have more videos and more advanced tutorials	3
excelent the techniques presented in the course are easy to understand and to put in practice the course has the potential to change the life of people that are dedicated to learning because it teaches to learn better more effectively and without wasting time	4
it really enhanced my confidence in starting a business of my own 	4
the course was an interesting way to explore writing models to explore climate change the way the assignments are written was sometimes confusing	2
i didnt find this course particularly helpful or useful im not sure why there was a disconnect somewhere i think maybe that i didnt receive the help that i feel i still need on the subject of how to create a great memorable believable character also some of the assignments were confusing nothing really stands out about this course and it was actually a bit boring and i dont feel i learned anything related to the subject everything about this class needs some work the videos the instructionsyllabuscontent and the assignments sorry i didnt like it 	1
the most boring course ever i just couldnt go beyond the first day	0
less lab exerciser only theoretical introduction	1
this course is excellent 	4
this is a basic and introduction course to user experience and prototyping the projects every week are pretty interesting and useful for you to think like designers i hope there will be more detailed examples of design techniques in the video	3
brief instroduction of getting and cleaning data	4
good video content but quizzes need to be revised	3
could have explained a little more about what we were doing for some of the modules for example in week  i didnt really understand the deep_features column or how the values for that column were generated for each picture	3
a good course for data structures in python gives a great learning experience with problem solving abilities	4
this is no real need for this course everything sounds like bits and pieces from magazine articles i suspect the sole purpose of its inclusion in the specialization is to fund coursera  at a time	0
it was good to get intuitions about adjusting parameters of various machine learning algorithms	4
a good foundation course i believe the information regarding tools and techniques couldve been presented in a better manner by working on live files and displaying it it was monotonous apart from the rest the final course case studies were brilliant and helped us to collaborate our understanding of the course	2
sholdnt be a different course it shold be very very concise not this long	1
i expected something else	0
i could not understand instructor using subtitles didnt help either as many words came up unintelligible	0
too repetitive very boring unnecessarily verbose the instructors tone of speech gets annoying after a while i skipped a lot and didnt finish it	1
i think the whole process was very well composed and really enojoyed all the classes	4
there needs to be more help available at least for paying students to answer questions and clear misunderstanding the quizzes are taking too much time	0
not worth the money the material is weak and the peergrading process is very casual	0
the equationsmath could have been delivered in a much better way	2
the course satisfied me in various aspects it is brief and clear thank you for our instructor for nice presentationsnevertheless i would expect more about pharma and treatment apporaches more about drugs available in the markets and new trendspsychotherapy applications  demonstrations would be very useful	2
explanations are very clear perhaps my only discomfort is related with the usage of matlab or octave for the programming assignments instead of more modern languages	4
very helpful in nutrition not just for kids but in general made me more aware of some of the processed junk ive been putting in my body	3
plus lots of information for a beginner course covers a lot of ground in htmlcssjs some applications requiring building webpages and js programs to get handson experiencenegative htmlcss and to a less extent js introduced pretty much as a list of disconnected tagsattributes etc leaves some confusion as to how it all fits together but that probably cant be avoided when covering a lot of ground in a short  weeks beginner course	3
great content 	3
good review of the history	3
this course which sounds promising in title and syllabus has many glaring deficiencies in fact i feel terrible if anyone ponied up  for it it roughly covers some concepts of data science but never at scale and never very clearly my background is a science phd with a lot of computational science experiencethe lectures clearly poorly planned bill howe has some knowledge about databases but little skill in communicating it the organizational structure leaves much to be desired much of the lectures are broadbrush and halting simultaneously being too detailed as times and not broad enough at other times technical portions are marked by a number of errors in speaking and on the slides as well as a lot of hesitation and jargon its as if he neither thought about the structure of what he wanted to say or a script of what he might say prior to recoding the session phoning in it is an apt descriptionthe assignments the first assignment with twitter was fun and interesting and gets the course  stars instead of one the lectures prior to this will not prepare you for the assignment though so might as well just skip them and do it on your own the sql assignment followed a set of lectures in which no proper discussion of sql was ever given the last assignment on mapreduce is acceptable although a number of errors in the homeworks are still uncorrected long after the first offering of this course the autograders idea of helpful feedback is similar to incorrect value try again week  of this course which contains a vast amount of information has no exercises at alloverall this class is the polar opposite of a quality online course like andrew ngs machine learning course do the twitter assignment and skip the rest lectures are poor and assignments are well below average if i were at uw this is not the kind of course id want representing my university in a public setting	1
engaging videos clear path with easy to follow directions for practices	3
on week  and i have learned quite a few things already	3
when going through the theory course i often wondered why the assignments are so abstract and theoretical and i thought that maybe when we come to practice we will be able to do something with our hands no way while reinforcing the theoretical background mostly repeating same postulates from the theory course this course contributes very little to its name practice only the last module on presenting goes a little further than making you ponder on abstract themes this is surprising  there are lots of practical tools discussed in the course and you have no opportunity to get hands on at least one of them except google trends and evaluate it at least for primitive purposes why does the teacher not take the example of the brilliant aric rindfeischs course marketing in the digital world with really wellcrafted practical assignments	1
very interesting topic and good way of teaching	4
if you dont speak chinese its a terrible coursethe lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained at least the first week the transcriptions into english are incomplete so understand this course is very very complicatedi do not recommend it at all	0
its a good course with some interesting resources most of the practice resources use flash and one of the assignment submissions is inconsistent with the other submission formats the content of the course itself is  stars for me there is one element that i wish had an explanation or somewhere to ask about it instead ill need to search the internet for an answer and hope what i find is correct	2
very useful and well explained	4
the value of this course is the collection of reading materials that can be found in the same place the lectures dont add much to the course	1
i really liked the community and the peer review assignments that made me do some creative stuff that i enjoyed	3
seems like an excellent review on the functioning of the brain at the axondendrite level	3
maybe a little thin in terms of content besides interesting	2
unnecessary extra videos that could and should be joined together in particular in lessons  and  all topic introductions could be joined with the following lets discuss this topic inside a daw videoawful dynamic range in some videos voice of lector is very quiet  db or less and sound played from the daw is much louder around  db in other videos the opposite loud lector and quiet daw change of microphone setup between intro video and in the daw video is also very noticeable and distractingrepeats of repeats over repeats this is not needed at all i could repeat everything by myself just pause video and replay interesting fragment i dont need to be reminded how a single background vocal sounds or that we need to change panning each time we add new track yes it should be done from time to time but not each time these repeats make the lessons unnecessary long it feels i could have been told the same information in half of time or lessthis combines with very slow pace of a lector i listened all lessons on  or even  tempo just to not fall asleepquizzes are strange stupid quesion appeared in quiz three which key combinations we use in the videos but why do you ever ask this how this relates to the topic i use another daw in another os i even dont have a command key i could have changed my hot keys so your particular hot key setup is not any significance for me i was expected to be quizzed for which parameters to tune how it sounds and alike not this particular crap trust me anyone could figure which hot keys to use i am not just a monkey i have an ability to explore my software by myself i dont need to be told how to copy and paste and even if i need this i just go look in the manual	0
you know when u see a bunch of good reviews of a restaurant and then go there and the food is terrible the place is awful and the waiters are the worstwell same here class structure is messy communication skills are poor i know this is not a design course but the examples shown in html are so bad u think u are watching a course from  the teacher says frustrating some many times and uses so much negative word towards coding and html maybe she hopes not desencoraje students by empathy but end up doing the exact oppositei would not recommend this course not to newbies not to oldies not to anyone searching to have a good learning experiencefinishing this course was painfull and i only did it because i promised myself not to abandond it	0
this course could also perfectly be a selfpaced course	3
the coarse needs a lot of improvement for the explaining way and the data offered way	0
showed me  videos and no course instruction am bummed really wants to take the course	1
its an excellent introduction to this internet stuffdecryption tasks are by far my favourite using excel made it easierinterviews with all these people are incredibleand of course dr chucks lectures explanations and analogies are really helpful even for nonnative english speakers like methank you	4
this course very briefly presents large picture concepts of entrepreneurship without going into a enough detail to provide any major benefit i would see this being most useful to a person who had only vague ideas of what entrepreneurship entailed overall the quizzes seemed to focus more on what was said during the lectures rather than what large scale constructs actually define entrepreneurs or processes overall ie questions focused on sentence construction and ordering in a lecture rather than the overall concepts the sentences themselves were expected to convey	2
this course is by far the best beginners course on programming i really enjoy the presentation of the instructor and the interactive online programming platform	4
fantastic course  great content very informative and engaging presentations	4
it is very basic and boring really you can spend  min googling the things you learn on this course	2
i felt unprepared for exercise  otherwise good	3
in some weeks only about an hour of input where several topics have already been covered in r programming thats very little value for moneythe final course project again feels like its done in a rush and without another review the submitted dataset should be automatically checked its simply impossible to derive from it whether the student did everything right but it could be easily done programmatically some of the questions have wording and grammar issues that make it hard to understand also there is slightly contradicting instructions between the task and review description	2
i enjoyed the course material and the idea behind linking buddhist concepts with psychology i just found some of the videos a little dry	2
very nicely explained	4
really horrible in instruction experience and application ability of lecturers poorly put together and assembled it was astonishing to experience such selfpromoting hacks rather than knowledgeable practitioners of the art of meditation it is very important to clarify the content of a somewhat titled misnomer the course was an academic study in mediation bring is rather esoteric questionable and personal opinion concepts and comments in effect a meshmash	0
excellent course thanks 	4
good course and professor very clear but a lot of content  is for usa	2
autograder is hard to understand and has no feedback could improve the feedback mechanism maybe with peer review thanks for the course	3
the advice in this class is very valuableand i really have learned a lot	4
nice coursebut the week  project is a little vague it would be beter if we had a lab assignment instead	2
even though the video lectures discussion forums swirl  reading resources are informative there is a huge disconnect between the assignments  what is taught it is impractical for people who have just been introduced to rwith no background in programming to take up this coursethe graded assignments should be made simpler or should be preceded by smaller ones which help firsttimers get used to coding in r i do not think swirl even though a valuable resource achieves this task remotely	2
awesome coursethis course enables you master python basic structures including stringlistdicttuple and read quicklyalsoyou will learn how to communicate with text files	3
awesome course	3
this course does not live up to the high value that ive come to enjoy and expect at coursera the videos are read by the teachers so the inflections are wrong making it very hard to follow the videos are clipped short and cut off the words at the end the information is given so quickly with terms not explained that a novice will likely not understand parts of it i found no value here there are far better tutorials on the web i cant see how any college or university would respect any certificate from this course	0
this course will make you write a script and thats it if you want to learn how to write a script dont take this coursethis course just push you to write a script without clearly teaching you what to do if you want to learn look for another course i took one from futurelearncom while in this course its free this one is a waste of money if you pay	0
its easy to understand and really have fun	4
the course doesnt allow access to the quizzes unless you pay for it i consider this to be contradictory with the statement that the free version of the course gives you access to all the material also not being able to take the quizzes makes the course meaningless	0
take this before any other course	4
too short too easy too costly beautiful picture beautiful title but low content	0
great course professor was great and kept me engaged	4
no discussion forum and verified certificate hence the  stars only prof adelsteins analogies and video lectures are amazing otherwise	2
this is not a course for beginners even though you go through all previous the coursesthere is no interaction at all with the professors or tutorsthe projects are evaluated by your own classmates	0
the professor talks too much about the website and his book that doesnt make any sense	1
i learnt a lot of new things about learning how to learn i now have a different perspective in life	2
basic understanding of data science	3
a little dry and boringbut its very useful	2
i really like the course would recommend to have more assignments	3
i enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem especially for the last assignment a simple response of this was answered incorrectly points not awarded isnt very constructive and was often frustrating bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating i spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code thinking it was incorrect when in actuality the online submission was just not working	2
i appreciate this course and the instructors time but so far i havent really learned anythingthe structure of every lesson is here are the  things were going to cover  name not explain those  things  here are the  things we coveredi think theres a lot of potential for this course in the long run i would advise having a professor from illinois who is not in the business school take this course and get their feedback i believe the instructor is very smart and experienced in this area so this is definitely a course that could grow into a coursera essential	1
this course mainly focus on statistics and statistical parameters and almost nothing about about understanding clinical research  as title anotate	2
its well done i was expecting more details in the lessons while students its requested to search many things on internet in order to learn for instance gitbash however its a good first course	3
the quizes do not match a  with the lecture videos there are some weird questions my algorithms outputs deviate from answers some times which is due to different software versions quizes are not very educating this time courses by brian caffo were much better	2
decent overview but could have spend more time showing plotting techniques in more detail than showing what makes an appealing plot also the section on the backend of matplotlib was more detailed than it needed to be for quick overview but not detailed enough to be very useful	2
really far from the courses by ntuquite disappointed	1
i enjoyed this course very much professors are passionate about learning have a genuine interest in teaching and are cool you will have a good time taking this course its packed with a lot of resources with a lot of useful and interesting information but you will not feel the time pass by if you want to improve your learning skills and want to know more about the whole learning process which is very interesting highly recommended for everyone what you will learn here is useful in every field for your entire life	4
this course is very short ive completed it in about  hours nothing was told about linear algebra statistics optimization it is not enough even to learn data science	1
i didnt find the overall content of the course very well chosen for an introduction to philosophy  since it covers so little the title of this course should have been an introduction to just a couple of topics in philosophy and there are so few philosophers covered however the biggest problem was instructoralasdair richmond whose response to debate was locking threads down every time his ideological positions were challenged he showed himself completely inept to have a debate with more than one course participant and chose to censor a variety of viewpoints he dislikes it was particularly ironic to see an instructor exercise censorship in a philosophy course  a domain whose objective after all is the pursuit of truth as well as to ask and debate the why of everything a petty tyrant does not make a good teachershould i ever meet anyone interested in studying philosophy my first recommendation to them will be stay away from the university of edinburgh since there is no respect for debate freedom of expression or inquiry there	0
a very well structured course	4
interesting information but the presentation of it is poor the speaker is almost entirely reading from the powerpoint presentation youre being shown  they could have let you download that and you wouldnt have missed out on anything really disappointing	1
i think this course does not a good job of explaining the mathematics very well the supplementary material is very good in that regard compared to the lectures however there are too few to make up for it i would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercisesas a result my learning success is not very satisfactory	1
a very good introduction in social and economic networksi recommend this course to everyone that wants to learn how networks are formed understand the basic concepts and get an intuition on the possible networks that heshe could formthe professor is talking clearly so you wont have a problem in understanding himone thing that was missing for me was in week  when he was talking about eigenvector centrality for me the most objective measure the explanation was really poor and you could never understand the concept based on what the lesson offered	3
this specialization is delayed for months now  very annoying dont give them money	0
this class was really difficult the course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes particularly in week    and the final exam was immensely difficult additionally the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered ie repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the orfs i had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and i simply didnt have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class	1
very nice introductory course i recommend it widely	3
great course very nice teacher as well	4
some information must be changed because offer bad view in last  years some states got independence some states do not exist any more and staff must be familiar with that	2
good and clear content a bit from an american point of view i missed some in depth explanation like the class of the nervsystem or the glycemic index overall easy to watch and good lessons	2
interesting but too simple	2
really tough to review this class outside of the context of the other elements of the data scientist specialization what was presented was straightforward and quite well done after i know how well prepared we are for next classes i will reevaluate	2
not for beginners as promised you need strong statistical skills to understand it	0
awesome great instructor pretty clear	4
very informative and easy to follow format	2
good for healthy living	2
very good basic explanation expecting some more indepth hard topics to be covered	3
the course is almost about nothing it seems to me that the teacher didnt make enough preparations and make a lot of mistakes during the couse after  weeks of arduinorelated courses ive got almost nothing new besides first  chapters of arduino starter kit book	0
there was some really great information presented but mixed in with tangential and unimportant sources i dont care about the fashionable aspects of iot	2
the best beginner digital signal course waiting for a stochastic and adaptive signal processing course	4
this course is poorly organized and presented in comparison to other moocs offered by wharton	1
great assignment	4
the course was quite helpful ive been trying to make games already but never knew where to start designing the game unfortunately its quite short which was disappointing i would never pay  for a couple hours of video with basics	3
confusing no help poorly presented	0
thank u so mach for this course it was simple and pretty good for the first  weeks i really enjoyed it   but the other two weeks though  i had a hard time there  if you try to improve it  the js wasnt understandable at all or at least mention in the course info that js background needed 	2
course material and contents are quite interesting but grading system specially peer review method is absolutely disappointing and kills the motivation grading level by other students somehow looks insulting regarding the time and effort which i put to think write explain and make videos	1
the lessons on presentation skills and traditional media should have taken just one one or two minutes and one or two slides at most the details and time invested really had little to do with digital marketing or the digital landscape the use of the handwritten pros and cons was an unnecessary novelty regular bullet text are more readable and technically more reliable most of all the presenters style was distracting it seemed that she was unsure of her subject matter and script i recommend rescripting and rehearsing the presentation  before reshooting it finally with the rapid pace of change in digital we should not be using reading material more than two or three years old five years is tantamount to a generation in the digital world	0
the professor of this course expects you to read his mind too much preferring to skip through explaining his reasoning for solving some problems such as calculating risk with the empirical rule he also mentions subject in the course outlines which he is supposed to lecture about in the course but doesnt or just expects you to learn it yourself	2
this has been one of the most fantastic journeys in my upper education excellent teaching great contents definitely valuable for anyone involved in business relationships	4
very good course but sometimes goes into too much detail for things that are quite common sense	3
not much teaching going on here the concepts are barely touched on before the student is asked to jump into training exercises that require lengthy proofs of concepts not thoroughly taught	0
i really enjoyed the course and found it very useful i can write a basic query now  and i got a bit more understanding of how to work with databases my only recommendation for the mentors is to work on more samples of queries using teradata and add the answers to the week assignments im still wondering a few answers and not sure if the output of my queries was the expected	3
shame on you university of houston systemi did the first three lessons which are less than average then went on to quiz  after completion a window appeared to ask me for money to get my results this information should have been provided when i enrolled i find that very mis leading	0
this was advertised as a six week course but the deadlines make it a two week course the assignments are exceptionally challenging given that the instructors offer now actual instruction on how to perform them two and a half days into the course not a single moderator has answered a question in the forums and i cant find a way to contact coursera about this problemi am very disappointed i was planning on taking additional courses through the coursera platform but now i am reconsidering	0
totally just marketing materials dont waste your time with this school at all you cannot learn a program in a couple of minutes	0
reviewed good course	2
very interestingly designed with theories about memory and films with related topics	4
i expected more practical exercises but i did learn some	1
even though there is a lot of useful information in this course i personally dont like it i wouldnt take this course again if i had a chance to go back in timeall hometasks are much more about programing in java than algorithms open any weeks discussion forum you will find out that  questions and problems are about java not algorithms if you are not a professional programer you will spend at least  hours a weak instead of  hours weeks task is just a pure joke  minutes explanation about most difficult structure in the course and not a single line of code after that you must write it by yourself just look at week  discussion forum do you know why there are  topics in week  and only  in week  because people decide not to do itthe goal of a teacher must be to make students love the coursematherialscience not to hate it im not sure about hating but it was annoying as hell	2
there was some nice content but not practical enoough	2
as a buddhist i feel upset of this course i expected it to be teach in a better way with more lectures ppt presentationsthere ought to be a better way of explanation	1
the course content was good but teaching method was too poor to understand first time little disappointment by courseracom	1
this capstone project was a huge disappointment to me the course caption stated that this would be where we would use location design and usability and persistence and settings to build a high quality app also stated is that youll apply your skills to create a fullyfunctioning photo editing app for iphone ipad and apple watch earlier i have also read that we would be allowed to build an app of our choice or according to teachers specification that text now seems to have been removedanyway none of these promises were kept instead we got something like  minutes of lectures in total for the whole four weeks all on a simple framework to track face features unfortunately this framework isnt very competent so theres only so much you can do with it most of us have only placed some static images and simple animations on top of the face shown in the camera view and that is actually enough to get full marks according to the form used in the peer review how does that even begin to fulfil the promises of the captionwe have paid as much for this course as for the previous three there should of course be a similar amount of lectures on more advanced topics like current best practises for ui design the location api which was promised and other interesting things that provide the building blocks for a state of the art ios app for a real cornerstone project i expect that more than  weeks would be necessary in order to be able to build a good app since many of us are doing this on our spare timei feel sad that i had the misfortune of signing up for this course before it was made but hope that you will take our collective criticism and make a good course out of this for future students	0
i greatly enjoyed the material presented in this course and while i do not doubt the proficiency of its creators the poor standard of spoken english of its two main presenters prevents me from recommending it to colleagues as another reviewer has remarked their english may be quite sufficient for day to day use with other experts but for inadequate for teaching students who are hearing many technical terms for the first time the transcripts are no better and also contain many mistakes i believe that this course should be stopped until these problems are corrected	1
this course which is part of data science specialization course which is a beginner specialization doesnt explain as it should to beginners they try to explain complex topics in  minutes  if i didnt need the certificate i would definitely not waste my time on this course youtube videos from khan academy or brandon foltz statistics  are much more valuable you really get the topic and they are free the professors didnt want to spend time preparing good material from my point of view the preparation is very poorthe course is more oriented to teach you to be a data monkey you know the code you need to write but you dont get what are you doing  where do these formulas come from	0
poor quality and heavily outdated content video quizzes were broken more often than not module quizzes questions and answers were vague and poorly constructed resulting in choosing incorrect answersreading material was of poor quality with many industry professionals not being professional enough to perform a simple spelling and grammar check	0
good material but short explanation and no detail exercises and solution practices before the final test makes the test a bite hard to resolve	2
this is a course for students with little or no work experience ive been in the industry for twenty years and found some good information but the quizes arent designed for experienced adult learners not being able to discuss with the professor why an answer is incorrect or even knowing exactly what about an answer makes it incorrect further distances the students from learning given that one essentially spends an extra work day each week on the course i expected more value for my precious time this week i decided the value isnt there i might recommend the course for undergrad students but not for working adults	0
too preliminary	1
this course is just definitions and the next one as well i was expecting a few more technical examples or exercises mixed with their accompanying definitions but i will check another course that is not so academic	1
thanks epfl good course and has certainly broaden my awareness of the possibilities of using scala	3
i didnt learn many data science concepts in this class	1
very disjointed and no clear progression while it teaches the basic syntactic rules well enough the functionality of r is explored in an ad hoc manner where the assignments have little to no relation to the weeks lecture	1
the videos and presentation are finethe exercises are quite easy and the main problem of the course is that they are review for other students withput any teacher assuring that is right	2
the course is misrepresented as infographics for all it is really infographics for journalists with experience in adobe illustrator there is no chance that anyone walking into the course with zero experience in ai can pass no chance periodthe final project grading is unfair  ridiculous the scoring is not good good excellent heres the thing scoring good equals a fail in the project and therefore a fail in the course your classmates with experience in adobe are scoring you based upon the instructors excellent examples not realistic at alli would also point out that the course is excellent for journalists but completely useless for those of us in the business world under no circumstances would we use journalisticstyle infographics in the business world having worked for multiple fortune s this style would never fly in the business world i wish i had known before i signed up i would never have wasted the hours energy or money	0
superinteresting subject but since i did not have access to all the literature through the website i was not able to finish it unfortunatly	1
very practical	3
this course starts very simply with data clean up almost too simply but then goes deep into the weeds of regression and fails to explain how to apply these complex concepts to any real world application for example if i build a regression model how might i use it in my analytics role at work and explain the results to my stakeholders how do i interpret the results of the regression for making informed business decisions how do i predict an outcome with a tree or neural network i found the instructor very hard to followunderstand thank goodness for the written transcripts hes clearly extremely intelligent but fails to relate these concepts to the student in order for the student to take away anything more than these complex concepts and tools exist	0
great layout and well presented concepts were stimulating and i felt i learnt a lot i would have liked some discussion around topics such as amblyopia and development effects of observer movement and the links between visual perception and the vestibular system having said that i think the content was plenty for a  week course	3
a simple list of programs that needed to be installed would cover  of the course content some of this content is also repeated in other courses in the sequence if you have any technical skills this entire course is extremely tedious	0
not very useful	0
i have followed  courses at the same time this one and html css and javascript they are covering the similar topics but this class has fallen short on most of the subjectlecture time is very little short videos and few of them each video is mostly nonfocused talking very few examples and so you dont learn muchby comparison the other class has a lot of videos each video is much longer and goes into many examples time is spent on focusing on the things to learn and you get a lot out of iti am dropping out of this specialization and will follow the other one which i hope will bring good content unfortunately the following classes are not from the same teacher but from the same university the following classes from this specialization are from the same teacher so i dont think things will improve much	1
i truly enjoyed the class andrew ng is extremely good in providing a valuable intuition and demonstrating the main ideas and critical points of the methods as i am a mathematician i often missed more rigorous and detailed mathematical derivations and argumentations however i very well understand that the class is meant to address a general audience with probably no further mathematical understanding than that obtained at school	4
too redundant	2
i felt that the delivery was not effective the pacing and tone of the speech was challenging for me to listen to there were unnatural pauses within sentences causing the lectures to drag out longer than necessary and it was difficult to connect the thoughts of a sentence together because of the unnatural pauses the result of this was that it it required an inordinate amount of effort to understand each sentence and to put together the sentences into meaning	0
its all reading no lectureswas boring	2
a good overview of tools for juniors or university students just getting into things easy to understandit might not have the depth satisfy more senior professionals but could be a good refresher if not	2
amazing course	4
i have not really improved tbh	2
this is a very quick and effective class to teach you the language and concepts within business metrics you will also hear descriptions of datarelated jobs  what are the roles and differences in skills applied  and these jobs are fairly universal across all industries the portion of this course that could be better is when the professor throws a bunch of math into the content it is basically irrelevant to this course and in and of itself it is so rushed and introduced so out of context that it is very confusing	3
the three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis	1
great idea unfortunately the course is young and there were too many bugs to get past week  hopefully these will be finished my next session	1
one of the best courses	4
this course provides a lot of methods and strategies about reading data manipulating data but i think some important issues in the real world are not discussed enough here like how to treat missing values how to deal with messy format data	2
im not installing anything completely appcloudbased or forget it need to do to the teaching of machine learning what aleks is doing to the teaching of mathematics	0
sometimes hard to understand the speakersthe medical knowledge is also assumed to be relatively high with no references to some of the terminology and background reading material that can bring one up to speed	1
this was painful the videos were so terrible in explanation clarity and relevance that i ended up going to youtube to watch the topics and other websites to read the content relevant to the subjects this must be improved	1
very useful course	4
i liked the course very much esp the nice videos and the zombies thanks againthomas	4
very informative and helpful thanks	4
good course would have been great to see a few more examples to explain concepts but otherwise great flow and good support through swirl coding practices	3
huge backlog of assignments from other sessions of the course that are waiting for peer reviews makes it very difficult to get your own assignment peer reviewed even if you submit before deadline course content is not substantiated with research assignment instructions and grading criteria are badly misaligned which is probably why there is such a big backlog of old assignments from earlier sessionsthe person responsible for the course should take the following actions aligning the grading criteria with the assignment instructions clearing out the backlog of assignments that have not yet been peer reviewed i estimate that there are  still pending review many were submitted almost one year ago	0
well structured in terms of content and the basic framework but the delivery is dull yes i know it is phys chem but i do think there must be ways to jazz it up gave up after week  so i cannot comment on the whole course	1
very limited treatment of the subject	1
good course	3
not very good nor scientific	0
never before have i had to create so many fake accounts nor write so many long and laborious manuscripts to be able to complete the assignments there were also so many problems with this last and final capstone project  delay in start date plague of technical issues from coursera lack of support from teaching staff and coursera when issues were experienced and instructions that were not clear enough at times im very much glad to be done and congratulations to all of you who made it through this last and arduous process job well done	1
the assignments could be harder	4
missing inlesson quiz with all the homeworks being at the end of the week this make following the pace quite tough	2
it was a very enjoyable course up till the end of module three where things went a bit awry mosty due to the unexplained withdrawal of the discussion forem and the failure of the third party platform to perform correctly at d which left us doing assignments that couldnt be completed with the assigned toolsa big part of the fourth module was about connecting and communicating with the internet via ethernet and wifi that was a bit lost on me mainly because i didnt really appreciate why i should want to i can understand many reasons but none felt very close at hand i think it would have been more enjoyable with useful examples and practiceok the course is still worth doing but i think there is much room for creating a smooth and enjoyable learning process it felt more like a beta version	1
good course but would have loved two things  more practical examples and certainly more detailed info on multiples	3
some excellent insights albeit a bit too superficial in my view would have loved to see some concepts explored more in depth	2
awesome and a half	3
was too slow for me to follow	3
this is a course for those who have not spent any time delving into comparative religion and testing their own traditional family taught belief systems with thoughts of act versus trut	2
this course was presented in a very effective manner anyone can take this course and walk away with the knowledge necessary to be emphatic in daily life as well as after a disaster	4
to the point and with excellent real world data to train on your assignments	3
i have done the course but i didnt get my certificate yet for reasons that i dont know	0
informative but did not really feel like it was of any use	1
clearly the instructor is passionate about the beatles as am i however its really hard to talk about the music of the beatles and not nine able to even quote from their songs much less play their music no songs no music for fear of being suedtakes a good deal away from the course	2
the course is really interesting but i believe the professor approach to describe and explain the topics is really confusing i had to search other resources to clarify the topics	2
the professor is nice but it is a little bit easy	3
repetitive content like the latter course not challenging	0
this course was extremely time consuming because a great deal of effort was required to translate it into something i could use i had a great deal of trouble with following the lecture videos the demonstrations of the tools were typed on a screen that was too small and the command line tools were executed so quickly that its hard to see where the screen full of data came from the lecturer had such poor pronunciation that lectures transcripts show that the voice recognition software could not understand and transcribe a lot of her words for example command sounded like comment and likewise was transcribed that way more seriously it was hard to hear the difference between vcf and bcf	0
its a good course in the last lesson miss more examples	2
simple and easy introduction to main concepts in r	3
while the visual set up is well thought out you can see the instructor slides and writing space the setup of course materials is too stringent for the beginning chemist more time seems to be needed focusing on the basics of chemistry and chemistry math such as how to read ch sig figs etc prior to testing on stoichiometry	1
very useful course	4
a good starting point in urban infrastructures management but too theoretical	2
i found the jump in difficulty for the first assignment too great this seems to be a view reflected elsewhere	0
excellent intro course  i wouldve liked more focus on handson exercises but it provided a great overview and foundation	3
there was very little actual content in this course and i cant say i learned very much in hindsight i wish i hadnt paid for a verified certificate	1
so basic and only useful for common knowledge not something for a specialization	1
a there clearly was a huge amount of criminal behavior that contributed to the crisis the presenters appear to approach the subject halfheartedly and focus their energies on disproving the possibility without sufficiently examining itb a lot of the review questions focus on remembering facts rather than on understanding the causes and effects for example what is the relevance of being able to remember that job losses at the height of the crisis were of the order of k a month or k a monthc it is obvious to anyone with even trivial financial expertise that the financial system today is weaker than it was before the crisis the too big to fail are bigger today by a large margin and interest rates are too low remember the search for yield was the motivation for the creation of the exotic securities which blew up the system secy geithners focus in week  comes across as a personal defence of his actions rather an objective analysis of what was done and should have been done	1
it is impossible to submit quizes and programming assignments without purchasing the course in my view this defies the goal of coursera to provide accessible education anywhere in the world	0
the course information was great and the assignments were very helpful what lost points for the course was not the content provided by wesleyan which was good but the poor effort on the part of many of the fellow students to really work on constructive critiques for each assignment i had at least one of the three peer reviews that was useless to me to improve my writing sometimes more there should be a way to rate critiques so that students cant move on if they dont do the work of critiquing well	2
good course gently showing an introduction had the playspeed at x the entire time though otherwise they talked too slow	2
unrelated and incohesive lectures disappointed lots of random topics talked about but nothing in depth	1
this course expects you to have a lot more ground for an intermediate course	1
excellent topics and awesome discussion open new ideas and gave many new thoughts to be aware about our emotions and thoughts	4
this course is poorly designed what course on a programming language jumps first into how to use the debugger and what went wrong with a program you are not introducing swift you are introducing xcode and doing a terrible job of it also i have been using xcode and swift for  months now and producing some really good work but i could only get  on your quiz because you have written questions with the purpose of tricking people instead of reinforcing or checking knowledge of the contentwhen you teach a new application consider introducing the interface first explain what the various areas are what they are needed for and how to control them this orients the user in the application and helps them to find their way around when they are trying to reinforce your teachings laterthe presentation for this course is so unprofessional its like a running commentary on a movie instead of an educational presentation i felt like i was listening to two geeks stuffing around and having a good time instead of people who are professional teachersim so incredibly disappointed with this course back to the wonderful work of paul hegarty from stanford university on itunes university and youtube for meuniversity of toronto  you should really consider what your teaching staff are doing before you unleash them on the world	0
very simple overview of the ux process	2
overall i really loved this course and taking it from such an important name in the field was cool there were a number of technical glitches on the quizzes unfortunately and often the wording on quizzes was unnecessarily confusing but still manageable so i dock it a single star also the visual organization of the lecture slides is a little shoddy compared to many other versions of nearly identical slides from hintons courses found online elsewhere on the mobile app many of the quiz questions were impossible to complete because graphics could not load not sure if its a problem with the course materials or with the app or with my device so that has not affected my rating for anyone considering this course be advised that ability in calculus and statistics are required for mastery of this material	3
very wellexplained course with essential details and different points of view by other conductors who live different contexts in conducting types excellent	4
too theoretical and completely disliked it even too basic for an introductory course i paid it and got unitl week  and just couldnt find the motivation to continue	0
way too much reading material not enough video lectures explanations the professor also needs to speak a little slower for people to follow	0
it was great overall but my review reflects the sentiment that i felt like they couldve added more topics	2
this course needs major improvement lectures included errors in the code while showing code in video lectures instructor was quick to delete code not giving time for students to view and understand what had just been shownon dec  two weeks before due date of final project large portions of all weeks of the course were changed requiring going back through to complete these new lectures no adjustment was made to the due daterequirements for the final project are vague and confusing and i am not able to submit the final project by the due date in about  hours if this issue is not addressed i will need to consider adjusting my star ratingthis experience casts a negative impression for me on the coursera platform and university of toronto teaching staffim disappointed	1
he talks tooo fast and his slides are too wordy and i feel so sleepy when i was watching these videos i dont know whyhowever as a phd biomedical eng im learning alot from this specialization and i highly appreciate them for creating such amazing idea im canadian and i know we have lots of similarities with you and i think i should make it for canada and our universitysincerelyazadeh	2
it is not very advanced	1
well organized providing a variety of ways to encounter the subject	4
excellent learning platform	4
not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks hard for a student even one who has a programming background to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfrontthe content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course the whole course seems disjointedwould have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving	0
the composition and visual elements part of the course was incredible but the lightroom part could be improved going through every feature in lightroom is not helpful its better to focus on teaching key useful techniques to achieve desired effects	2
the lectures are amazing but i wish we have a lot more involved homework than the short quizzes if there were more research questions or problem solving homeworks that demonstrate deeply the understanding of the subjects that would have been great the current quizzes are very trivial and doesnt test the understanding of the material only the fact that you actually went through the lectures even if quickly	2
this course is mistitled there is very little music involved and a lot of social action the discussions and videos are interesting buy i am confused about the use of music to carry the courses agenda perhaps the influence of the arts on social action would better define the intent of the course	2
im pretty much always turned off when a course wont let those who are auditing the course ie not paying take the assessments im dropping out	0
good to know the data analysis trend and useful tools	3
for multiple modules the questions were out of order some of the videos didnt seem polished to the point that it made me think it was not the final editsalso from other coursera courses i really valued interviews and summaries that highlighted the key points vs a summary of the topics converedfinally the module quizzes didnt seem to highlight the key points but instead had questions specific to notsoimportant details eg which agency created the mb campaign	1
the course is very informative for those interested in data analytic and want to go for market research kind of jobs	2
no passion is on his lecture there is only dryness and ethical superior pride through his theory altruism without love is an empty vanity and welldesigned commercial intention for selling his theory	0
its a requirement to put down a payment to take the quiz	0
rich course informative trained on machine learning algorithms	4
i love the course love the professors great course thank you	4
good course but could have explored the topic with more depth	2
suggest to have more interactive slides than lengthy readings	3
i did learn a few helpful tips for analyzing data with excel  particularly how to do a regression analysis in excel which is something i didnt know and is not intuitive but for a course that is supposed to teach you how to analyze data in excel there are actually very few lectures that actually show you how to do anything in excel so much time is spent on how to calculate stuff by hand without even mentioning how it translates to excel also the lectures have a lot of errors that were not corrected in a professional way just a random slide put in as an afterthought the lectures got a bit disorganized towards the end like the professor was in a rush and then forgot to relate everything to actual business analysis the final project was especially difficult as not much was explained  i had to read the forums to figure out what i was actually supposed to do	1
i feel that the course need more explanation  i got really lost in the begging of the hw	1
excelent but havent this material in english	2
most of the lectures were very short i would have preferred more in depth discussion of the topics	2
this course competes with a full specialization on coursera with a slight flavor of the understanding video game course also available on courserathe grading is supported by quizzes and assignment associated to a poor grading system i found this single class less challenging and interesting than the full specialization on game design from calarts although it allows you to have another view of the process of game design in a more engineering way eg writing documentation and not thinking on creating game	2
lots of interesting ideas most presented very well hitandmiss for some of the topics but usually spot on recommended	3
great course like the slides and the way it structured it could be broader if not so google centralized and more international for example in russia there is yandexru yacom which controls  of search market and in china there is baidu and others and no google and facebook these questions is not highlighted in the course	3
i like how this specialisation evolves as in the previous block it does not give you all details but merely sets the direction the homework assignments are quite good and if executed properly will teach you a lotthe only complaint  frequent ambiguity of multiple choice quiz questions	3
okay for an intro not the most boring content it is a bit aweful that the insist on you using their libraries and programming environments you spend perhaps  of your actually practicing coding and the rest is wasted in libraries you will never use again	1
the course is very interesting and challenging prof stone is detailoriented and openminded the only thing that can be even better is the course content for example we learned about decision making styles we mentioned majority minority expect authority with input etc but prof stone didnt mention which of these is the most effective one i think the course content can go into more details and more explanations overall i really enjoyed studying with prof stone	3
a few helpful tips but most of the stuff seemed like common sense	2
i liked this course but there were a couple of advanced topics core data watchostvos that i wish we could have more time to spend on i feel like there wasnt enough time to complete the assignment as we had in the previous courses	2
good and easy to understand	4
if this class is truly designed and welcomes beginners who have no knowledge in seo as it is described in course introduction assignment instructions should be provided with sample writings or rubrics the writing assignment instruction readsfor example identify headers alttext and etc and recommend how to improve them for optimization where does it say provide alttext images for recommendation make a tie to the recommendation and list references for the images recommend if not  points off the lectures are short doesnt show much details of what is expected for audit writing or analysis writing but my  page analysis or audit is not enough because a thorough rubric expects to see this and that that is not even mentioned in instruction it is a common sense that a writer has to be detailoriented with recommendations then the course should not encourage seo beginners who has never seen seo audits or analysis paper if not assignment instruction should be listed thoroughly as rubric so that a beginner seo student can pass the writing and take it as a learning experiences endless flunking malgrading system is this courseras education method	0
intended for nonnative english speakers or english speakers without a strong literary background scholarly communication gives an overview of how to construct coherent arguments for academic publicationthere are multiple typos and presentation issues throughout the course however they do not necessarily detract from the content of the course	2
unfortunately this is a poorly designed course it seems like it is strictly scripted the instructor looks like shes reading the material its very boring to watch and as a student with a business background i learned zero things related to pr or research everything discussed through this course is nothing beyond definitions and general business knowledge she keeps hinting on discussing the topics further in different section which didnt happen this leaves me confused on why not discussing its details now discussing swot analysis is a strategic concern and as a pr related course we should see more related to marketing and communication techniques as a result of the search but guess what its not there this course is not worth the money	0
very basic	1
a bit boring	2
this class was so informative and it brought to mind many thoughts and questions about how we interact globally if youre not familiar with the area you probably should bring up a few maps to refer to during the lectures  he has plenty of graphics but that wasnt enough for methe history of this area has always been so convoluted in my mind at least this class has taught me a lot and kept my interest throughout too many names but taking actual notes helps im starting the next part now very worthwhile class	4
this is a great class its full of fun and i have learned a lot thank you profs	4
i did not enjoy this one i find it too politically charged as it emphasized the visual diversity religion ethnicity over the secondorder diversity diversity of professional profiles and personalities which should be the focus of a management course	1
great course but its too expensive	3
good course overall there tends to be many lectures that are just lists of commands also they dont seem to be updating the material many lectures are several years old and still have typos in them	2
thank you	3
please update the given gemfile in homework	0
volume too low need more concrete examplesthank you for your effort though i learned from the course	2
wish those courses would be longer id really like to learn more about cdns	3
while it is a good class i have a message that one of my assignments is passed by not verified i have no instructions on how to verify it im disappointed something that should be simple is such a roadblock	2
very informational i really learnt a lot from this course and definitely recommend it to everyone who is teaching not necessarily english but if you teach music maths etc this can be a very useful course	4
was very difficult to follow this is a complex subject and the prof is trying his best but there are times the explanation is not sufficient instructions for installing gulp was not good i was unable to complete the following exercises after gulp installation failed instruction needs to be short and crisp building on top of each other project has its negative there must be solution at the end or at least a check point where you can start clean for the next project	1
the course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples it also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough it was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts	0
the worst course ever on courserait is important to realize at the outset that i am a very avid learner and always give everything a chance to be completely tried out before giving a judgement and unfortunately this course is by far the only bad course ive encountered on coursera for the following reasons the professor wastes a whole weeks module on explaining something trivial like the interest rate and compound interest rate without naming the necessary terminology that is commonly used to make things worse he has a condescending perspective on students and wastes so much time glorifying himself in an upsetting manner that patronizes learners his demeanour is unprofessional and quite disturbing when he gives mentions at the end of the week that i can feel you i can feel each one of you now to the degree that even the cameraperson filming him cuts his nonsense out after putting up with all his boring nonsense that i already know despite being a linguist not a finance person i gave him a chance and started doing his first question quiz which was completely isolated from reality and unrelated to his course material or teaching all questions were boring and calculationintensive and i still gave him and a chance and went through the whole boring set of  questions just to tell me that it needs upgrading for such a banal and facile coursenow i have an idea about the level of teaching at michigan university and i will recommend all my friends not to attend such a university due to the previouslymentioned reasonsa complete waste of space	0
could have been more practice than theory	1
lacks the hands on learning experience i was looking for but a great overview	2
its very very basic i know its considered an introductory course but i expected more it was very interesting and informative though	2
this was a great mix of videos reading material and quizzes to keep me engaged	3
i do not like this course there are far too many prejudicial ideas  even in the first unit a language does not have to be used by a single  unified group to define it as a language esperanto is a perfectly valid language fully capable of expression and does not belong to a single  unified group there are no native speakers either  which does not rob it of the fact that there are winners of the nobel prize for literature who write in it the things you are saying about language are not merely willfully ignorant they are highly offensive  prejudicial i cannot conscience supporting a course like this	0
too fancy and the structure is not very clear not very much learned	1
the assignments took me so long it was supposed to be  hours but got obsessed to have them ended ok but in  hours nearly i would recommend to build up from very basic stuff and as the learning advances going into more difficultythe hints for the assignments were valid in the the last lesson but for another lesson i think lesson  there was no hintthanks	2
the content was really neat and definitely not something i had been exposed to before i really liked the quantitative parts of the course and wish there had been more time spent on that and more quiz questions on thatthe reason i am ranking this  stars is that i felt the quizzes were unreasonably difficult or perhaps they had bugs week  quiz i had to take multiple times and really couldnt figure out what the correct answer was looking at the discussion boards i believe my sentiment is shared i have taken multiple coursera classes astronomy astrobiology calculus and these are by far the most difficult quizes i have encountered	1
not happy about course    got cancelled	0
the course provides with a detailed overview on how the eu is functioning if you intend to study the eu law this course is very helpful to understand the basics	4
course contents was good  assignments were challenging  one suggestion is to provide pdf for each classroom session or may be a weekly pdf would be great  it so happened that attending each quiz without pdf it was hard to search from videotranscript back and forth	3
good course but its too much academic i can see that you were talking things you dont understand or read a script without put any of your efforts	2
great course the concepts and techniques are very usefull and simple to apply	3
please stop reading from the screen it looks ridiculous	1
terrible course the instructor just read out of the power point no examples or case studies or insightsvery disappointed in the class	0
while us politics is important for many other disciplines this course didnt have that much depth in my opinion to really be applicable on demands of international student and point of view still very interesting lectures and good talks	2
id rather have assignments for which you really need to changewrite code not just run existing one otherwise the course by itself is great	2
the course lacks substance and the quality of a danish center for higher education	1
i had previously learned some of this material in previous courses i had taken years ago in computer vision and artificial intelligence however this course provided a much better explanation on how and why these techniques work the concise presentation style of the mathematics the inclusion of system design in the syllabus and the construction of the practical exercises using matlab were all very well done and much appreciated	4
not really engaging most of the material looks really outdated and the instructor has a very classical way of presenting which does not profit from the potentialities offered by coursera	1
angular js is a crucial component of all of the internet hardly a website exists without it and its clear that angular will go places however this course fails on a few crucial levels as such my review might look scathing and ill detail why in a minute but i want you to know that this course is quite possibly invaluable when it comes to web development besides the fixes that would need to be made on the instructors side are minor but when working without those fixes things get infuriatingly frustrating rather quicklythere are errors in the code supplied by the instructor that need to be pointed out by students scripts sometimes dont work explanations are subpar when explaining things such as scope there are parts that are seemingly there to pad out the lessons such as task runners sometimes doing things exactly the way shown in the video with additional fixes by both the professor and students it still doesnt work some exercises are an hour long for something that wont be quizzed in the endunderstanding that this review was made about a new course that covers something rapidly changing and not persistent i still did learn a lot of valuable things and i would recommend this course to everyone involved in web development however be prepared to question your own sanity your skills the software you use software in general and just despair at times all in all it is a price worth paying for the amazing knowledge you gain	1
very basic tool based solutions no real content behindusually these courses are about learning and being mentally challenged not getting a toolbox	1
it is good thing to learn	1
i expected it to be more advanced	2
pretty simple the univ of michigan data science with python set the bar pretty high	2
this is not a bad qualityprice course but after working accounting and finance iese courses i have to say that this one does not have the same level to improve specially content organization firt week is very heavy comparing with the others the first and the last videos of the course in starbucks in a very windy day they have a very bad audio the fourth week exam doesnt offers the pdf of the results in final exam results they say  is  of   anyway i expect more quality in the next course of the program managing people	2
important material poorly taught	0
great	4
online grader for labs is terribly buggy attempted submitting labs several occasions  all fail local builds work fine with apps working as expected and tests pass the online builder gives very little feedback other than buiderror  wasted will not recommend and will never fall for it again avoid	0
all the chapters have been well explained however the last chapter was a bit vague and needed deeper insight especially the code used for data visualisationthanks dr chuck	3
a good course where you can learn how ml algorithms work practically	3
its not exactly i was expecting it covers lot of theory part some practical work in coding and security practicles would have added more valuei enjoyed the some material pdf suggested however i didnt liked accordingly to microsoft question and material it was made  years back course content must be updated and more invovled tasks or discussions with course makers it looks like some videos are once made and kept as it is i never saw actual teachers teaching something in this course just browsing reading and eassy writing	2
the capstone topic was not very interesting	1
this course has helped to gain lot of knowledge on web crawler and testing web services through python	4
i learned much about machine learning however its not enough for applications so id like to learn more	4
initially i thought this was a great course but my optimism quickly dissipated the homework assignments all required information that wasnt covered in the lectures forcing hours of searching for answers during the week questions in the forums were answered within a day or so but there was no help at all on the weekends if i got stuck on a friday night and couldnt find an answer myself i had to wait until monday to get a reply from an instructor or teaching assistant for those who work during regular business hours and use their free time on the weekends to study this course becomes nearly impossible to complete	1
positive there are a lot of examples and interviews with people in the field that help to understand better i think the concepts exposed are useful and relevantnegative i think it the course could be done in a much more compact way the introduction and conclusion of each video which is just music take together around half a minute i think all the concepts could be introduced in half of the time there is a lot of reiteration and some texts are so similar with one another that more than once i thought i was doing again the same section	1
the material is sort of interesting but there is not much handholding i actually am an excel beginner and have merely an average grasp of mathematics before signing up i read the prerequisites  there were none it is advertised as a class for beginners but i have found it beyond frustrating and whats more i prepaid for the specialization so this excel class and the final project seem to be an utter waste of money without me going off to study excel at length before trying the course again why not label it as an intermediate or higher class i feel there should be a more obvious indication of the difficulty	1
i enjoyed this course so much that i am trying to save the transcript so i can read it when i cani love dr eggers explanation as always and enthusiasm as well in teaching this course i would like to complete the coursework if i canplease keep up the good work i am not a student of duke university but i felt being one because of this opportunity to study under dr eggers wing thank you again	4
it s amzing angularjss course and a good teacher  thank you	4
i watch the videos after work when i get home and jennifer carbrey puts me to sleep the presentation is such that it is very difficult to stay focused	2
very lucid explanation of concepts by prof andrew ng assignments are very comprehensive that make us understand the problem in depth	4
too hard to follow	0
im sorry but this is just ridiculous i cant recommend this course to anyone its all about advertizing emily fox cant stop but recommend amazon services and carlos guestrin does the same for his datos graphlab create which is might be great in general but absolutely useless in educational purposes the practice part of every week is just a waste of the timei cant say money well spent	1
horrible class shame its in the series	0
a good  fun idea to implement would have prefered implementing my own idea though	3
the continuity and smoothness of the first two python courses have been lost from week  onward the assignments were badly worded and that distracts the learning people were trying to decipher the wording of the questions not learning how to code lectures of later weeks were rushed very little buildup of understanding and i felt assignments were done for the sake of passing very little were learned during those final  to  weeks effort were mostly wasted as little learning has been retained may be there are topics that needed to be introduced for course  will see as ill be doing straight after the course overall is still very positive and the prof clearly has put in a lot of effort and they are greatly appreciated	1
requires much more than a month to digest the material and complete the assignments a defaultinitial oneweek offering is too tight unless you are only taking the course not working i know one can complete the course in more than a single round and i did that but i still dont think the expectations should be set for a single monthinstruction video content can be much better at least compared to a lot of other courses on coursera	2
coursea does not allow me to quit the class also i cannot do the homework or watch video at my own pace	0
i loved this course there was so much to learn	3
awesome course	4
im sorry but i have taken many courses on coursera and this is without a doubt the absolute worst this isnt minimal teaching its practically nonexistent frankly buying a book would at least give more guidance than tossing oneminute lectures out there and having students blindly fend for themselves under the guise of experimental learningplus you then have an all or nothing grade system  there is no middle ground just pass or fail on an assignment that had little to no instruction or examples listed to begin withim truly surprised that coursera agreed to allow this course as it is i suggest that the instructor and team see how other instructors at universities are teaching their coursera courses just because something is free it doesnt give free reign to be lazy if i had paid for it i would have asked for a refund this entire course needs a serious revamp	0
the lectures were very short the contents are too simple and general does not have the deepness and comprehensiveness for professionals did not live up to expectation	1
very good consolidation of learning techniques thank you	4
a very nice course for people looking to learn chinese as a beginner	4
excellent for understanding the fundamentals of pr	4
most of the content was already known to me and in my opinion it scratches at most the surface also it only contains round about a  minutes which is not that much	1
only one assignment at the end so you go through  weeks before being asked to code this seems like a big mistake for any programming course the final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes you cant put that as a project on a resume because youre doing  of the work with your hand held through itworst of all the code given to you does not adhere to javascript best practices like local variables not being declared so that they become global variables a big nono spacing being all over the place etc javascript has a bad reputation and sloppy teaching with respect to best practices is very bad	1
too difficult to learn for beginners	0
very interesting course it pays to have some control theory and matlab background	3
the best course taught by best professor and best university	4
very good this is my first coursera couse i think i can get through all the class	4
it is a good introductory course for sql	4
two days later and still no available	0
excellent course first  weeks were very technical but highly informative quite a bit of accounting knowledge is required to understand the work last week of lessons were more simple and intuitive to understand but overall a very insightful module	4
ive lot studied thanks to coursera allow me to tried this course this is great course for everyone who want dedicated their self into seo thing more professional	4
excellent courses in a simple but deep understanding way of ml	4
geared towards esl students i had signed up thinking it was for native english speakers but it was more of a english 	1
while i enjoyed this course and the topics covered i dont feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to i enrolled in the business analytics specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside not outside of the  weeks of the course id say that only week  was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level id say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis but not as advertisedi also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard	1
weeks   were worthwhile weeks    were very thin not really up to expectation based on first course or even first two weeks	1
this was a fun course information is presented in digestible bite sized pieces the peer review process works fast and welli was surprised how perceptive the critiques of my photos were	3
really basic course not needed for people you have already done data science specialization in coursera	2
enjoyed the foundation of web development for the next iteration of the course i would suggestion going over in more detail how html and javascript should be linked with using javascript validation this was something many learners struggled with and the provided resources missed some key things beginners would struggle to grasp	3
the course content was clearly and concisely taught the professor expounded on concepts and gave applicable examples the only suggestion that i would give is to provide downloadable slides in pdf format for each lecture video	3
did not like the course at all that is why i decided to discontinue the course	0
the glitches with the autograder at the end were the only reason i didnt give this five stars otherwise great course looking forward to joining css	3
could have been more interactive the ruby course that i studied from lyndacom was far better than this	1
good introductory course and easy to understand can be completed within  days	3
this course was interesting its truly an introduction to the field ive actually read about game design in my spare time and it was nice to remember some of the concepts ive seen its all positive and good but id have liked to see the assignments handled a bit differently it just felt too much one way especially with one page rule i do understand this is done to keep people organized and not going crazy with their ideas because since its peer reviewed it should be fair also once your game idea from an earlier week didnt have much room to introduce the aspect presented in the current week you feel kind of stuck although assignments mention we should build on previous weeks games there is also mention to building a new game too that part could be clarified or the nature of the exercise can be much more varied than one page requirement	3
excellent course well presented and at pace and level of difficulty well suited to coursera	4
ok content but too slowly presentedpainful experience to go through all the lessons	1
there is no real flow between videos and questions not easy to follow good efford good content just wrong methodology for online training for 	0
the fact that test cases are not available is extremely frustrating and time consuming i absolutely disagree with the instructors about the reason why test cases are hiddenmichael levinhilearning new complex things is time consuming it is essential and it is ok without this time spent you wouldnt have learned even half of what youve learned while trying to find your mistakes yourself also the testing techniques presented here are indispensable in the real life and many learners of the algorithmic toolbox course have already confirmed thishello mr levinfirst please forgive me for communicating with you in this place i am not sure if there is a direct way to answer you but i believe you will have access to my responsei entirely agree with what you said that this needs time and i do not mind spending time learning new things that is why i am here in the first place but i think that hiding the test sets misplaces the balance where this time is being spendlet me give you an example week   hash chains  assignment no  i wrote the app submitted this and it failed on test no  having generated tons of test cases i was nowhere closer as all looked good but still failed your engine as it turned out the problem was not with the algorithm implemented but with the presentation layer check x command when x is not found in the hash table should return blank line and my program returned nothing i could not find this in the specification hence lots of hours trying to figure out the solutionit was not a bug with the program it was the problem how the data is presented i do not mind spending time developing solutions to the assignments i would love if there were more advanced even optional problems to solve but i want to spend this time on the algorithm and solving the task rather than trying to figure out how to display the dataplease do not get me wrong i absolutely adore the course lectures are brilliant and my opinion should be regarded as a constructive criticism even if you do not agree with me thank you again for what you are doingregardsmarcin	3
the course was a bit too shallow for me the techniques shown are very basic examples of what can be learnt using stock python libraries json socket urllib elementtree or external beautifulsoupi really expected something more for instance authentication techniques or methods to parse complex websites rather or in addition to the basics shown here	2
beginner course well designed but not for advanced game developers	2
the accent and rhythm of jogesh makes it difficult to follow the coursethere is no extra information in addition to the presentation the teacher is only reading the slides which makes the experience quite limitedboringthe content is enough to get an idea of bootstrap basic functionality	0
the instructor kept referring to different authors and books as if she wasnt sure what she was saying was true she was just reading off a screen and not actually teaching might have been easier and a bit more beneficial to just read a well prepared set of slides on my own the first set of quiz questions also werent really relevant to what was in the actual lesson quite disappointed in this part of the specialization as the other sections had in depth presentations clear information lots of examples and great slides	1
i really liked the course i would have preferred to have been forced to do the optional assignment as it takes that little bit of extra motivation coming up to christmas to do these optional assignments i still plan to do them but being forced to do them to get a pass would helpotherwise i really like what i learning and how its presented just need to use it somehow to get a job	3
nice overview of the specialization since it aims at showing the advanced and interesting things you will learn during the specialization some of the practical sessions are way too advanced thus for me felt more like a mechanical copying of what the instructors did rather than an actual assessment of what i understood also since some of the applications are actually repeated at the beginning of the main courses it feels like a repetition somehow when then you move to the specialized courses	2
this course was so dry i could barely keep myself engaged i know project management is not that boring 	1
the design of this course seems rather lazy there should have been more meaningful contents and discussions in the videos	0
i like it simply and clear about time management and productivity thanks	4
this course is awesomely good and hats off to u mr yaakov for ur efforts one request is that atleast for the person persuing the course for free should be given some kind of certificate for completion of this course	4
it was helpful but too technical for nonbusiness person to learn about basic project management it also would have been easier to understand if the information presented were to be broken down into smaller sizes	1
what a lazy excuse of a course why would you call it a course just call it start writing and put it on a blog no guidance no tips no effort whatsoever without any guidelines how does review from a fellow novice help its like blind leading the blindill go with the minimalist style of this course and use just one word to describe it rubbish	0
i like that the course covered negotiation in general in relatively short time however i found the lectures were too dry and theoretical as they lacked real life examples	1
i like the professorbut the activities and projects always had errors and issues that werent easily fixable and the mentors are absolutely terrible at providing guidance so i most likely wont be able to finish this course	1
good way to start with ruby and rails	3
the course is challenging and the exams use realworld datathe sequence of the course is not linear the exams are too difficult compared to the material covered in classes	2
my feeling is that the course creators did not fully prepare and scope of the course materials ie lectures supporting artifacts assignments required for the available time alloted to each weeks topic no syllubus or suggested reading material was available until the course started which leaves little time to decide on the value of the course or to acquire the reading materials the lectures glossed over topics that where only minimally supported by brief supplementary lectures provided by the teaching assistants at the start of the course the lectures and sparse supporting material were only available in video format not very conducive for detailed review the student population had to beg for electronic copies of the materials which became available around the end of the second week of the four week session the assignments say they require  hours but i would venture to say that most students have spent way more than  hours on the assignments just in researching solutions let alone debugging supplied software along with their portion of the assignment in summary the topics were interesting however the organization and supporting materials were lacking making for an unsatisfying learning experience	1
im sorry to say this course is really boring poor in resources and im sorry to say this but its the worse coursera course ive attended 	0
could have been better should explain not just read out the presentation anyone can do that	1
it is more likely a microscopic level of mos description for me i like to have a devise design perspective on the mos components 	1
great to learn about cash flow both positive and negative makes sense a course for the real world	3
it was really boring just reading the text in the presentationit can be made in  classes not 	1
one ar lecture is  minutes nearly fell asleep	2
awesome course one of the best courses i have been part of on courserawell paced very rich in content very good delivery of the ideasassignments very good a value for timei just wish practice quiz to have more number of question and more challenginga very special thanks to jogesh thanks a lot	3
this is a great course and a wonderful introduction to the world of business metrics i did wish it was more data driven in that i really thought there would be more excel work but im glad that i took this course because despite the lack of data in numbers it has set me up to do well in the rest of this specialization	3
boring course useless videos only the referential resources and exercises are good	1
very good course for beginners	3
it was a spectacular journey through time and space thank you	4
its a very basic course with little technical overview the history and story of emergence of internet is described	2
i think it is so useful for everyone who need to improve there productivity	3
i was expecting this course to be more challenging than functional programming principles in scala but found this one easier in the end the assignments were ok but i felt like they could have been more challenging and also that they should have tested my understanding of the course contents more thoroughly	2
at times a direct contrast the the precursor class assignments too easy lectures okay but syllabus lacked structure too easy wasted time	1
really nice course help was available when i needed it however i think some of the integration of urllib needed to be better elaborated	3
interesting and good structured lectures challenging assignments	4
great and interesting coursealso very alternative theme liked it so much	3
very good course i recommend	4
its satisfactory but i recommend reading the book	2
i dont like the fact you have to pay  dollars just to unlock assignment submissions the fact that other students have to grade each other is not worth the  dollars think of all the students that may attend the course will more than cover the server costs if it was  otherwise the class so far is useful	2
not so good the course explains mathematical models and excel applications but both are not detailed there are many mistakes in ppts and assignments	2
its fantastic from the root 	3
besides those interested engineering those interested in learning how stuff works will love this course i have been studying calculus and was bored with math problems that do not have real world application this course provided those applications in spades although at a beginning level in mechanical engineering if you love math and love solving problems this course is a great place to do it	3
i dont like the teacher	0
instructor was good content of whole program was focused on analytics perhaps a better title for this course is social media analytics	1
great course to get an understanding of the basics of materials science	3
it was the best course i have took ever nice lecturer and friendly tool with good platform thank you for working for us	4
very poor explanation and very complicated topics	0
knowledgeable course taught by great teachers	3
enjoyed course from day one to last quiz highly recommend taking this course to anybody interested in politics it was extremely interesting and valuable	4
please we all have accents but i can not understand some words and makes it more difficult	1
hands down the worst course on coursera i thought it might be beneficial to take this course but it doesnt cover anything in details wherever algorithms are explained a really lousy job is done to be specific first and second weeks are covered badly i am still trying to understand the material by reading external articles on the course topics i think that first course of this specialization was pretty great and this one is disappointing	0
i found this course to be dry no practical examples just information presentation like reading from a book the lectures do not prepare you very well for the quizzes and even less for the assignments this is the only course in coursera that really got me disappointed since there are not many students in this course one might feel a bit left alone	1
the content is ok but thats about it near zero interaction from staff short videos leave a lot to be desired and worst of all there seems to be a problem getting everyones assignments peer reviewed which makes no sensethere is a somewhat comical thread wherein staff direct students to contact coursera directly via a contact us link on a page but get this the link isnt there students repeatedly pointed this out only to get directed again to the nonexistant link in an online forum its important to actually address concerns replys that avoid directly addressing concerns sound like automated messages and thats the feeling i get herethis course requires a diy attitude and a willingness to proceed without feedbackif youre looking for a good example of online learning look elsewhere	1
the course is ok but it doesnt give any certificate of completition for free users something that many other courses do give	2
instructors are not to be found	0
the course is good but very basic suggested for individuals who have never had any exposure to information on conflict or humanities	1
very basic course i would only recommend this if you are just starting your phd program and you have no idea how the writing process works	0
this course it is very simple you could fine easy tips for increase your productivity	3
the course is interesting and the selfreflection activies are great opportunies to learn about yourself however the course is very short each week takes less than  hour to watch and it feels like an introduction of an introduction if you love to learn a lot about something i dont think this course is for you however if you want to take time to learn about yourself its great	2
really simple and to the point course learned a lot from this really thank you to people at stanford for putting this together	4
sorry folks but we are not learning much here	1
course is mostly theoretical so far its difficult to say anything about its practical implications and usefulness its my first course on coursera so i cant compare but i think sometimes it lacks a bit clarity especially considering lecturers english and bad quality of subtitles which sometimes do not match real lecturers words anyway it was interesting and now im really intrigued about how i can apply this new knowledge to real everyday development tasks most probably i will try following courses in the specialization thanks a lot to authors	2
i loved to hear from the writers their own experience when writing a novel so enlighting	4
good course	4
great stuff to learn and teached by one of the greatest mind of our decade	4
useful info now we start to get some python super powers	3
i really liked the fact that we were given an overview of all the machine learning techniques before we actually delve deeper however i would have rather appreciated it further if we used open source python libraries rather than graphlabi think the use of graphlab really did limit our scalability and use elsewhere other than on the courseplease do consider using open source tools in further courses and also provide starter code for the assignments in one open source library in addition to the code provided using graphlab	2
very good introduction to game theory works everything out with intiuition	3
it was a fun course and throughout the course i learnt the fundamental basics of essay writing only thing that could be improved on is to put some example essays for students to read as an assignment and go through it afterwards also to talk a little faster	3
this is the worst course i have ever seen in my life im aint lying these guys use the terms which they havent thought and they use it so frequently as if they have thought it one who were teaching may be industrial experts and have lots of experience but one thing to note isteaching is an art	0
excellentbut i couldnt complete the course without payments	1
great course	3
long especially the week on iran really proud of myself for getting through it	2
what a shame english subtitles were promised and not arranged i truly wanted to learn this course obviously coursera doesnt care	0
good introductory course	4
videos tended to be a bit longer than necessary might consider c	2
very intriguing and interesting lectures these got me thinking and venture into fibonacci numbers and a bit of sacred geometry too	4
proof reading needed for the slides and for the quizzes overall this is a low content course delivered in a rather boring and uninformative way	1
the course is pretty uneventful i have done some courses from other universities which are more interactive and fun but the content is great	2
it is very useful course for beginners and although those who have done systematic reviewsmetaanalysis before in order to improve their basic understanding there are few shortcomings with the course lectures frequently refer to biostat and epidemiology classes but no reference or links has been provided for these classes the course ends without any lectures on metaregression and sensitivity analysis which is a bit confusing as the module  promises such lectures	3
its a very good class to learn to use sql in a systematic manner even if you had used sql or are completely new the two databases  terradata and dognition gave a lot of valuable practice	3
the course is great but beginners but not for intermediate and advance learners i must appreciate coursera for providing free courses thank you	1
barbara oakley developed a great course congrats  i liked very much the extra videos especially the interviews	4
the quizzes are about the course structure and not product management	1
hard getting through this course it is probably because i dont have adobe lightroom software perhaps if i eventually get it i will revisit this course as the tutorials are thorough i scored it as i did because i think the course title should have lightroom  pixlr in there since weeks    dominate those two	1
great course for people who wants to learn how to program recommended for everyone however i find the final few chapters on loops is harder to grasp and would recommend if there are ways to simply on it overall i had a great experience in completing this looking forward to advance further in programming python kudos to mr charles severance for the great work 	3
great approach very usefull metods im really exited on doing the more specific courses	4
a bit light on content but ok for an introduction	2
despite having high quality contents the quantity wasnt as much as i expected the number of videos could be a lot more	1
very good  useful information that can be easily implemented	3
this facinating class has already improved how much i retain from other classes im taking i now better understand my ability to remember things and i am thrilled with the results of using the mental tools that it teaches	4
thats very good but it could be better if there is a way to pay and get certificate we are in educational and science word not politic word i live in iriran and there is no way to payi suggest you to provide some prepaid card for coursera that we can use of them same as itune gift cards	2
i did not find this course as good as the other parts of the specialisation there were some interesting elements there but also a lot of redundancy i dont feel like i now have all the tools i need to do a through structured content marketing analysis	1
need more lectures there are complicated topics with weak background for the studentsexcept that it is a great course thanks	2
useful eye opener in different directionsoutdated could use an wisp of technology update with a few years since recording	2
not as polishedcomprehensive as the previous courses especially week week and week but useful techniques nevertheless	1
not a great deal in the way of lectures and notes but the value of the course lies in the handson assignments would recommend taking this course along with doing some independent reading for a more comprehensive primer of uxui	3
good course learnt a lot from here	3
the weakest part of this coursera  are quizes  full of question which check detailed facts from lecture instead of testing skills	2
its great	4
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment	0
still canny program 	0
basic project to learn deal with data through web	4
this course is a waste of time and money im an experienced programmer and i thought this would be a good introduction to swift it wasnt the first two weeks were short introductory programming lessons week  advanced swift consisted of one minute video that barely scratches the surface of three separate topicsmany things that i would consider fundamentals for this type of programming course classes for example were rarely even mentioned much less taught and demonstratedif you want to learn swift look elsewhere dont waste your time and money on this course	0
its a great introductory course although a bit superficial	2
this course was terribly underwhelming there is no interaction from the wharton staff nothing that connects this to anything learned in the specialization and nothing that even resembles a case study grades are subjectively assigned on a very narrow grading scale by peers and the format of the assignment doesnt allow for enough explanation to develop a thesis of any information given to the student is from magazinenewspaperjournal articles without data and we are tasked with identifying a business solution to a problem with little context very disappointed in this offering after taking the data analysis specialization offered through duke university i know what a capstone course should be and this course is so far from that it should be removed from the course catalog	0
a very very helpful course it made me realizing where did i lag going to opt for specialization as i am highly impressed by the content of this course	4
i learned so much about the right way to present a case analysis very meticulous and the community really care about what you put in your answers this course deserves to be taken seriously	4
wellstructured highly informative	4
very interresting course i have learned a ot about the big bang processe and the inflation	4
good course especially for those involved in business strategy it requires attention and a lot of quizzes to be solved nonetheless all information shared by the professor can be useful and a knowledge advantage this course can be taken by people who arent familiar with businessfinanceeconomics	3
it so boring	0
i dont mean to be harsh but this course is increibly boring and sluggish the reading material is heavy the lecturers speak so slowly and dispassionately that its impossible to engage with the subjectim sure that there is really good content here but i couldnt find it	0
instructor has lack of knowledge they are not subject matter expert and they tried to deliver their best	2
just begun but so far so good i will update the stars as the weeks progress	0
very similar style with part i the instructors are clear in explaining the models however it would be more useful if the instructors can give several realworld examples on the financial market	3
im glad to joint this course thanks miss colleen	3
very enjoyable pretty useful and very clear understandable thanks to learning how to learn team	3
this is far too rudimentary to be something produced by a university	0
great course but its misleading doesnt tell you from the start that you have to pay for it	1
not what i was expecting as part of the program at all being more a visual learner i had a very hard time with how the math was covered in this in the course i need a slide that is specifically v is xxxx r is xxxx so i have a reference point and i found with most examples given i was having to go back and forth between multiple items and transcripts to gt what i needed the other thing that i think would have helped me would have been less presenting and maybe a couple of quizzes for knowledge checks vs the pause and think items that were included i did like scotts humor or at least humor attempts overall and i think a live class with him would be better than video additionally i felt that the course was a bit out date already it was recorded in  and i think i would have liked it more if had only been a year behind vs a year and a half	2
extremely basic i wouldnt even call this a full course its about half of an introductory course i assume the pacing is to allow for people that may have difficulty with learning the language im not certain that it has the depth necessary for those that may have difficulty though if you are at all serious about learning to program dont limit yourself to this course or its pacing i would suggest researching every subject covered to get a bit more depth and moving through it at a brisk pace if you take the pace suggested in the course youre likely to have bought a new computer before you can program anything extremely useful	1
the course is well designed it takes you through the buddhist principles and corelates how the findings of modern psychology are supportive of buddhas teachingsit has normally been held that religion and science cannot convergehowever this course has to a large extent been able to show that it is possible to explain the matters of conciousness and beyond in terms of modern psychology	4
i couldntfinish this course because it was too much the i wish it had a more practical aspect	1
very cool to study the get back to basics	3
while the first week touched on excel and the equations can be used in excel and have efficacy in regards to analyzing data it feels as if the course emphasizes more on utilizing math than utilizing excel and according to my understanding that was what i thought i was signing up for so it felt like a baitandswitch to me	1
again a course that comes with very simple and not always good prepared video lectures but for recieving a grade an enormous math knowledge is necessary with no further help given	0
cant finish even week  if you dont pay	0
course lectures dont seem to match up with the questions on the quiz it is also not clear if the typed in answers are not read by the program correctly or if the answers do not match what the instructor is looking for in any case the  weeks quiz is very difficult to figure out	1
im really appreciate it that i can learn this course through coursera which taught me a lot about python thanks very much	4
great teacher with tons of personal insights and tips really helpful course	4
really wonderful high level overview quite helpful for me	4
if you didnt like the first few lectures you wont like the rest it wont get better more repetition clichés and advertisement that anything else	0
the assignments were not challenging enough	1
this course helped me understand the basics of python programming	3
the male professors seem to speak chinese half the time therefore not being able to understand the material for students who arent fluent in chinese i prefer the female professor from advanced neurobiology i who presented the material in english and in an engaging and coherent way	1
too general no depth not recommended for science or engineering degree holders	0
not very interesting	1
the video is too long	0
good intro to r and git	4
good content but blocked quizes in free version is bad idea	1
excelente curso introductorio a machine learning	4
very low content i got more information about berklee than about music from this course it is more of a showoff of the university than it is an actual informative course looks a lot like a yt tutorial just much fancier because they are berklee i watched from the beginning to the end waiting for them to start talking about anything other than naming intervals but it didnt happen they try to eartrain you but any app for eartraining will do it better quite disappointing	0
the course need more improvements in terms of material presentation and execution the two presenters format didnt work well as it made the lecture look informal the material need better preparation and it seems at times to be adhoc coding a few videos were not edited properly resulting in lengthy black screens after the presenters were done talking	1
it is very intense and full of useful information that you can not find anywhere else except if you are practicing this specialization for a long time	3
this course was a very helpful for filling in gaps in my knowledge between high level software development and details of processor architecture and instruction sets mips mainly i didnt have the exact prerequisites for this advanced course so it was hard work especially at the beginning hadnt done the earlier architecture course recommended and am not an electrical engineer but have trained and worked in software development and physical sciences the concepts are not unduly difficult but the course is very detailed and the sheer volume of recommended reading somewhat overwhelming i got by with buying a kindle version of the hennessy and patterson text book plus a few peeks into a digital logic book i appreciated prof wentzlaffs insights he was clearly teaching from experiencethe course is however not really designed bottomup for online teaching the lectures are videos of actual princeton lectures with a few multiple choice questions hacked in it helps to keep a copy of the slides when watching as when the camera pans out it is difficult to read the diagrams on the boardthe course homework was quite difficult even after the brief solutions were given the midterm and final tests exams were however well constructed and instructive and much clearer as to what was required so all in all a real bargain for the cost of a text book	3
great	4
the urls for the courses required readings are presented as nonclickable text in the course lecture videos there is no list of urls for the readings available which i could find and to take this course students are required to copy dozens of long cumbersome web addresses from the videos	0
there have been some undesirable references to equations in terms of equating modeling to economic growth and investment i was interested by the syllabus and its outline of theories and the means to use models to study social sciences and systems sciences after week  though it was not a very interesting course so i considered trying to simply survey most of the videos to gain some more information not necessarily for any more insight from the professor from the university of michigan	1
i am excited to finally start learning python and i found the structure and approach used in the first course in the series very easy to pick up and follow along thanks for making this coursera experience interesting engaging and fun	4
it is tottaly unacceptable to have to pay to pass quizz i cancel my participation	0
maybe could be more in depth i really appreciated how passionate dr chuck is and how much he cares about his students even in online lectures thank you	3
explanations of concepts are too complex for nonbiologist who want to approach the genomic field	1
overall it is good hope there is a way to download all the study material	3
i was actually very excited for this course yet it disappointed me the lectures were monotonous and stiff i found myself watching the videos on mute with the subtitles on ps the persons who transcribed the videos should have taken the time to see and hear what they were translating since there are quite a few errors on names locations even simple words i also found the lessons rather superficial did not dive into the heart of this great civilization finally having read a book or two on the subject the whole experience added almost nothing to my previous knowledge on ancient egypt the course is good for those who have no previous knowledge on the subject and wish to learn the basics regarding egypt its gods mummies etc	1
very helpful and practical course to learn about data sourcing and cleaning	4
ive missed chinese hanzibut apart from that the course and tests are all good	2
this is more like a one hour lecture than an actual course i was hoping for more content	1
it was an excellent course very well explained and paced thank you very much dr provart	4
good course i just expected my last assignment to be more challenging but with the examples given we can create challenges for ourselves on real life projects	3
the concepts here are useful and mr egger is a knowledgeable instructor but  this class is really about gathering information with excel as the tool  you arent learning anything about excel functionality so the title of this course is really misleading if you just want to become a stronger user in excel  there is a huge disconnect between the video lessons and the excel worksheets used to complete the assignments and since many previous reviewers mentioned this it seems like thats not going to change  the disconnect between the lessons and the assignments wouldnt be an issue if the instructor could be bothered to respond to forum questions mine sat unanswered for  days as the deadline passed you are not going to get support if you dont understand something	0
materials and topics were good but the course lacks in two things they stress more on math and theory i would suggest additional videos explaining the implementation in matlab would be helpful and would throw more insight to the maths second there is no programming assignments so its a little easy kind of if the instructor or the ta would help out in giving the assignments and implementation in matlab then it will be one of the everlasting courses	1
foundations of business strategy has greatly expounded my knowledge on business strategy not only as an essential component of a business but existing primarily as the core of any business	3
introductory course to data structures the lectures are good however the assignments are too much guided sometimes you can get it done without actually understanding what is going on	2
well taught and incredibly useful course r is a great language for statistical computing and data science and this course provides a wellpaced introduction to the language and some important features	4
i passed this course with score  finished all quizzes programming assignments and swirl exercises but it wasnt useful that much the videos wasnt interactive to much theoretical partsless practical you cant solve the assignments depending on the tutorials you have to google for the answers and know how people can solve the problemsi recommend if there will be a new version to put these points in consideration	1
very basic	2
i think this is a vrey great course for all psychology lover because any one able to take a lot of information from this course in a very short time	3
clear simple language well presented keeps audience interested	3
course lacks real example and full of theory it lacks steps of what actually needs to be done to achieve seo	1
if you are going to try and complete the specialization for this course series i suggest you look elsewhere i was able to complete the first course with ease but the second course to this specialization felt incomplete and does not tie in very well with the how excel is used dont be fooled by how easy the first weeks assignment is for the second course of this specializationmy initial rating for this course alone was  stars but due to the lack of effort and information in the nd course of this specialization i have to give this  star as these courses are all tied together	0
poorly planned irrelevant to the subject test questions	0
the course is almost about nothing it seems to me that the teacher didnt make enough preparations and make a lot of mistakes during the couse after  weeks of arduinorelated courses ive got almost nothing new besides first  chapters of arduino starter kit book	0
final project almost impossible based on lectures	1
this course fell far below my expectations and failed to rise to the level ive expected in comparisons to other courses ive taken via coursera a few of the issuesvery basic information if you have any marketing andor messaging experience you will most likely be bored by the course for a course that focuses on engagement very little mixed media usetiming issues of informational slides usually too shortas someone who is a paid adjunct i did not value paying for the course only to discover id have to review other students workas a professional i did not feel the need to be reviewed by others or share for free any input the course did allow me to just space through and then submit with no actual answer but doing so does impact your final passfaili signed up with the intent to take all five courses fortunately i planned on paying for one at a time after a disappointing course one i will not be taking the additional four	1
too much focusing on history of telephony and only little focus on iot	2
assignments could have been a little tougher with more emphasis on coding	2
very nice content but dont like we use graphlab since i wont use it after course	3
some essential concepts are covered in this course which help understand the basis of iot	4
the professors voice put me to sleep he was monotone online classes work best when interesting material is married to dynamic speakers	0
very good course nice examples carry on with the good work	4
i had a very poor experience being graded by peers although the capstone project assignment itself is excellent the peer grading rubric is not i was not fairly graded and i am sure of this 	0
i like initial courses like exploratory data analysis but later on it got harder to follow the lectures a lot of topics were just rushed through and little effort was made to make them engaging or interesting	2
great experience designed for noobies and also for people who have some knowledge on the subjects its being a great pleasure to learn this course also available on my ipad and on my android smartphone so i can download the video classes and carry with me recommend a	4
excellent in depth explanation of rdd and the apiheather is super informative and the material is being passed in a practical and explanatory wayhopefully there will be more courses like this one about spark streaming and machine learning	3
very good and wellpaced course id give  but there are parts that seem to be missing  lecturers refer to videos that arent part of the course or the previous one functional programming principles in scala overall 	3
nice but the speed the pro talks could be a little bit faster	3
good course to start with very ok	4
by far the best course i have ever found about data structures in java	4
highly recommended this course was a great guide to understand to pre socratic philosophers professor susan sauvé meyer is very clear in her explanations thanks a lot i enjoy the course	4
the creators were too lazy to actually film themselves instead most videos are just text on a screen with music creates a bit of a feeling of a kindergarten festival ill stick around until i get too bored	1
a good courser specialization for starter	3
would have enjoyed to have been shown examples of breakfast lunch and dinners for people that are just getting started	3
first i like these courses allot they are pretty close to covering just what you need to actually do machine learning in the real world and not dive too deep into topics that have no practical valuehoweverthis course was a bit too thin the last  weeks of the course contained little in depth informations and seemed to brush over allot of different topics that could have contained more information although they where important topics the course could go more in depth on at least  or  of those topics the last  weeks could have been a course on its own if properly explored however the concepts are well enough covered to be usable in practice i belivethe programming exercises where ridiculously simple everything was reduced to filling in  or two lines in a bigger function i understand that the point was to see how these functions are made and that it increases our understanding of the algorithms already existing in packages like schikitlearn and graphlab also the content became a bit too repetetive actually started in the second course but continues in this course the time used on variation over the same topic in different models made it challenging to pay attention when the lecture finally came to a new point brain fell a sleep while waiting for something new	2
too much basic stuff about twitter and how everything works in detail could be more advanced	2
very much interesting and hand on map of yourself or your hobby it provide you a good and exact command thats required for you to make a good web page so go for it  professor are very cool	2
i am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swiftthe lessons felt very unstructured unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didnt know they were being recorded this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an introduction to coursea little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programmingto summarise the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content	1
in easy steps it is explained the process of learning there are many helpful and useful tips in this course	4
i already learned other programming languages in the past and have forgotten them more than  years agor this course is really good in refresh what i know and adding more it is a really consistent way how this course is structured python is really an amazing and easy programming language	4
amazingand extremely helpfula big thanku to everyone who helped in making this course available  	4
it is two hard for beginners or the lectures should be more detailed because assignments are hard and on the another hand there are two much information and lectures for one week it should be less lectures and information for one week in this way it has two much load for person who works it should be stretched trough more then  week for example  weeks with less lecturers with assignments that are graduly get difficult because first assignment is to big jump	1
it very short and brief i was thinking it will also emphasise and help us to grow our communication skills for the st century communication but its just a brief explanation of some changes and nothing more	0
while some of the materials are interesting in this course it gives a very high school feel rather than providing help with college essay writing it would be helpful to have this course more geared towards college academic writing and have more emphasis on developing ideas finding resources to support ideas synthesizing paraphrasing and all the other skills useful for college academic writingi assume most people who come to coursera are above high school level some of the materials like the monkey example are a bit too childish and the sample articles can be too simple to be appropriate to learners at this level	1
the lectures tend to be a bit boring however the hands on assignments give great insight into understanding the basic concepts of game design and narration	1
i learn a lot from this course	4
适合非计算机专业的人学习很基础的入门对于有别的语言编程基础的人来说安排的课时太长了自己看估计两天就能看完了另外老师挺有意思的its good for new programmer while it arranges a too long time for a experienced programmerby the wayteacher is interesting	3
the grader is horrible leaving you with such brief error messages you never know what is wrong with your code the forum is not as useful as i expected nor as it is in other coursera courses you know few classmates the videos provide you with tons of information but not much of them are wellorganized i often felt tired and confused since these long videos seldom got to the point	1
the course was quite informative and interesting i really enjoyed it	4
it is not letting me submit my lesson  review without payment	2
the videos are poorly done and its hard to follow with practicing in a playground at the same time also some of the optional material is required for completing the assessment which a bit unfair the material covered in the videos is too basic to be able to apply the principles to a larger programme	2
when the heck do you actually start programming its just him explaining and explaining and explaining and explaining i did a little course work where i programmed some simple console applications like talking about my name and favorite games but then he drones on for hours and hours about concepts without actually putting them to practice he jumps through parts that could have otherwise given valuable information and experience like creating the deck class nope he just has it all premade for you the course stresses youll need to program a lot to gain experience so youll be doing it a lot of programming in this course  but im not theres no programming at all its just droning on and on about concepts and how they workyes its important to learn what these things do but its much more important to put them to practice my eyes are glossing over trying to sit through these  minute long videos of him just explaining concepts rather than having me put them to usei do not recommend this course to anyone unless you have a bob ross fetish and like listening to monotone talking i can learn and so much more and gain valuable experience just by googling and youtube videos im very disappointed in this series	1
the first week was a bit dry but improved the following weeks articles we read were interesting and the assignments were engaging since i wanted to achieve a high grade i found that the weekly assignments took longer to complete than described	1
poor material terrible french accent not a good android course at alli dont raccoment it unless youre a total novice at android development	0
it was awesome	4
this course was very scattered and included several different lecturers it was the least focused course in the specialization but still did provide insight in an area i probably knew the least about	2
great and highly relevanttopical content however i found the quiz assignments to be needlessly tedious at times	3
very disappointed about this course the topic is very interesting for me at least but the course organization is horrible lectures do not provide enough information to complete the assignments zero interaction from course staff issues with getting assignments graded in previous session the staff just refered you to the coursera helpdesk but you cannot easily contact coursera directlymain focus of course seems to be earning money and not educating be warned and dont pay for this coursei really dont get why this course has so many good reviews	0
super long super informative loved the beethoven week	3
instructions for assignments are not clear lectures are good but its practically impossible to get the certificate	0
very good 	3
the material was well delivered but i found it distracting to go between the video lecture and the additional material	1
learned a lot through the course will recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how to be effective in social media	3
informative	3
excellent and important for everyone to know	3
it is a good course but rather for real beginners on a basic level but everything is clear	3
excellent course for learning and practicing	4
this is a great intro to machine learning but it needs to be polished and updated theres too much discrepancy over the assignment descriptions and the tutorial discussions tom mosher is fantastic in the tutorial forums  would have spent many hours wandering aimlessly if it wasnt for his guidance however he does point out many holes in the course as it currently is and id have to agree with him linear algebra review should absolutely be a requirement prior to the beginning of this course	2
too general extremely easy to solve the quizzes i would say needs deeper evaluation of the learned materials	2
i was really disappointed in this course for several reasons i did not complete it because it was really not worth spending time on the organizer impressed me as only wanting to sell copies of his book on dog behavior and used the course as his vehicle then there were games to purchase online to facilitate teaching my dog cognitive skills the videos were lacking in creativity i was really disappointed with this especially since its a cool topic that could easily be presented in a very exciting way the artistic level the videos slides etc were something a high school student could pull together after taking solid courses like modpo and positive psychology i was amazed at the lack of effort that was put into this	0
very interesting and easy	3
more interactive assignments using the parser would have been great as it stands the quizzes had mostly relevant content but the lessons were anything but engaging having colleen talk at the camera for  minutes per video got tedious really quick	1
not really enough content to be a course in its own right should be additional material as is useful but definitely not a requirement	0
too easy if you already know anything about github or rstudio although i do understand the need for an introductory course the experimental design video was the only really useful part and contained quite entertaining examples	2
very basic course it only touches the surface of the subject most of those information you can find in every webpage on time management	1
is very basic and dont send assignments becose i dont pay the course	2
basic principles for learning python and also funenjoy it	3
probably because im new to all the big data and graph analytics terminologies but the lectures in this chapter were quite difficult to follow in my opinion the instructor was just talking not teaching nor explaining just like someone who prepares notes and is reading to students the handons were a bit helpful but overall this class is more for those who already know about the subject	2
many useful techniques and perspectives in this coursetake this course if you are looking to learn new techniques to improve your timeefficiency and performance in learningdont take this course if you are put off by pseudoscientific assertions an explanation based on the insula being the fear center of the brain comes to mind or interspersion of useful information by neurobiological theories that have no relevance for improving your learning performance	2
it is very helpful and easy to get started	4
the course is really goodi was little bit familiar with statistics but after this course everything became clear in my mind and dont have any confusion also 	3
the content of the course so far is interesting  and to be fair ive only completed the first week of this courseunfortunately the combination of multiple lecturers within one part of a lesson often with highly varying accents reading verbatim from lecture notes makes the presentation of the course material come off as very stiff overdirected and hard to understand its hard to adapt to the idiosyncrasies and lecturing style of a new person in a four minute video at which point you get a whole new lecturer and have to start the process over againa maximum of two or three lecturers for the entirety of the course perhaps with the occasional guest speaker would be helpful also either allowing the them to deliver the course material in their native languages with english subtitles or perhaps having them record the course material in english in something similar to a classroom environment where theyre accustomed to lecturing would make things infinitely easier to followthis too many cooks in the kitchen issue is what i also suspect happened with the week one quiz i do not know who generates the quiz questions but they seemed to require a lot of mental gymnastics for a multiple choice quiz perhaps on my end there could be a cultural misunderstanding in how a quiz checks your knowledge of the source material let me put it this way in my previous university studies i have never taken a multiple choice quiz where the question starts as in your opinionsadly i will probably drop this class  but the course has sparked enough of an interest where i will probably be picking up some books or doing some informal research on my own about this topic	1
very nice course this course will teach you to have control over your mind which will help you for time management  to score high in masters programs thank you for this course	4
sloppy unorganized and poorly presented try the similar class on edx and youtube for a much better and clear explanation and presentation	0
most of the materials are conceptual would like to see more real life examples and methods applied	2
this course assumes that you are familiar with freertos	0
good and easy to follow	4
assignment doings felt not that good as the courses before	2
the class format  only quizzes during most weeks no programming work then ending with a huge programming assignment  is really poor pedagogical technique if youre going to teach programming have programming assignments every week instead of dropping a massive assignment at the very end of the course	0
i am highly disappointed with the policy of providing the homework only to the paid participants it seems this is gearing towards another means of making bussiness when it comes to educationi understand that grading and providing feedback requires effort and the fees charged is required to the cover those cost but like before we must have an option to get access to the homework allowing us to apply our learning while it maybe be acceptable not to have any feedback or certificate on the course completioncurrently the closed homework policy goes against the basic objectives of mooc and i hope it is reconsidered	0
it was well presented but a little light on i was hoping for a bit more meat to it but interesting none the less  a fascinating insight into how few people apparently cook their own food	2
great introduction to python data structures	4
first the assignments always had poor instructions it wasnt until grading time you would find out what the criteria are after your assignment is submittedsecondly there was no documentationhelp for the fact the windows needs a webserver to run content in this section many versions of windows cant do this discoveredresolved over many hours when course content would not workthe actual course content was sparsenot much to it other than bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap after how good the first course washow much ground it covered this course was frustrating poorly documented and a disappointment	0
nice course gives a god insight on what can me done with r and predictions	3
excellent course and very good explained	4
while the topic is interesting the materials are poor and the lectures are not particularly insightful the slides have several mistakes and typos which makes you doubt the whole course the speakers are not engaging and it just looks like no effort was made in preparing this course additionally the materials do not prepare you for the review and on weeks  and  the hardest you dont have a chance to review the questions or correct your mistakes the course really needs some improving	1
if you are a real beginner like me having zero or little programming knowledge and your time is limited i think this course or the specialisation is not suitable for you the assignments and quizzes are very time consuming one week i spent literally  hours writing and debugging codes for just one quiz	0
very interesting course about the healing and helping capacities of music in different personal and cultural perspectives	4
very useful knowledge and practical skill the assignments are interesting fun and practical like this course	4
amazing course loved every minute	4
i probably should wait to finish this course before reviewing but im halfway through and have found my motivation goneim finishing it just to finish it the delivery adds nothing to the content especially as much of it is simply the presenters reading lists also shown on screen class content would better serve the students as a searchable pdf and why are there superspecific questions on quizzes about things like what specific funders require in a grant proposal thats information that you look up when you need it not that you quiz people on this class is a let down	1
the basic ideas exposed during the course are interesting and good food for thought however the course contents practically depend on the film and book by swimme and tucker so at the beginning of the course one is shown the complete film and over the ensuing weeks a particular book chapter and its corresponding fraction of the film is presented again the quiz which is very little demanding at the end of the week is basically based on those contents i paid for the certificate since the idea of a specialization appealed to me but i am not sure it was worth	2
updated concise stteamless	4
gives a very good overview of risk tracking for portfolios and includes an introduction to derivative products	3
i expected much more information in videos instead of that videos are very short and provide only few information and dont allow us to pass the exams at the end of each module there are some link to websites where you can learn much more and which are not even written by the professor	1
the highest video production values of any class ive seen on coursera so far unfortunately thats the best part of the class the support is simply nonexistent a post by someone associated with the staff from a previous run of the course suggests getting help troubleshooting python from coursera staff the instructions for the class software are out of date the source material for the assignments is sometimes unsuitable to the task youre asked to perform eg statistical analysis on a data set aggregated from disparate sources and the pretty videos are at times completely unrelated to the actual assignments the very first week with the literature review dropping this specialization like a hot coal it looked quite promising but the aggravation over the poor organization and lack of support considerably outweighs anything i could get out of it	0
good to know about education on future	3
to get value from the class i used other online materials to understand the topic thus i spent about  hoursweek on this class	2
i was unable to complete this course because the course required at least two years of programming knowledge prior to enrolling i was confident that i could learn while taking the course but i continually failed to pass the quizzes in the second of five courses it was very confusing and the questions were cryptic	1
interesting to try r hands on could have made more definitive statements on the usefulness of each test there was lots of you could have a look at this analysis or this one or this one without covering why each one would be particularly good for this case some of the later exercises also made quite of a leap in terms of what you were expected to know about r syntax although the follow up answers were good if you didnt understand what was expected	2
no option of completing the course without paying so why do you call your site free online courses and why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments	0
great but needs more material to fill in the gaps could do with a little more on the advanced topics like trajectory generation definitely needs more motivational examples videos of the lab and demonstrations of the research relevant to this course done by the course provider would be great	3
very good material with more than enough detailing on the subject wish it could have more practical examples and exercises	3
in my opinion this is not a course the contents are a short interview cut up over  weeks fluffed with a myriad of vendorbiased pdfs the s classroom style video editing is annoying to boot	0
the lectures are often superfluous and the professor keeps jumping from subject to subject from the mathematical side the course is also rather shallow half of the first week quiz verifies knowledge that in my opinion has no practical importance not something to remember	2
it looks like a notsogood synthetis of the course available on yale website	2
not a bad introduction but if you already know a bit about programming you can get the same basics and learn more quickly with a book	1
excellent course i really love the way it opened my eyes to the workings of disease and how it could be controlled globally i am a certified medical laboratory professional so i have some kind of medical background but this course has been pleasantly exhilarating it added so much to my current knowledge i absolutely recommend this	4
this course was really bad structured was often the discrepancy between the information provided in the videos and the questions in the quiz also a lot of time the system was very picky to take an answer like correct just because the format used for example ee in one equation and because this was necessary a lot of guessing in order to find how the system take the answer by correctbut really the worst was the discrepancy between the video and the quiz because my impression is that the videos were cut to fix in the time but they were cut a lot missing important information to be used in the quiz	0
hijust a terrible course honestly couldnt understand a little what was the message you wanted to pass on studentscouldnt stand more than a week of this courseapologies for being overrude	0
very useful knowledge in this course although some of the quizzes require some small fixes and there are minor mistakes in some lectures	3
possibly the least well structured class ever also not made for people to actually learn how to program in r it is sad that i paid for this and ended up going to another resource to learn and it was much much easier	0
i thought it was going to be an all online digital strategy for pr its ok though the information is very useful	2
great content my only suggestion would be a more indepth course over a  or  month period with the price adjusted accordingly	3
this course covers python data structure very efficiently the course mainly focuses on most commonly used features examples used in lectures as well as the exercises are very practical	3
there is no proper documentationat least there should be some clear instructions for first program	0
too little material for  weeks all this couldve been written in a pdf instead of videos	2
this course should be required for high school and college students it would have saved me a lot of pain and anguish just absolutely wonderful	4
the landscape is quite basic and would require further development to be more relevant	2
the course was great but there were some quality issues such as incomplete instructions in week  quizzes and some errors in numbers and the formula bars in the videos ie formulas within the spreadsheets were immensely small and we could not see the formulas therein participants raised this several times in the discussion forum but there was no response from the instructors though the course content itself was excellent the rating is because of the issues mentioned otherwise the course was great and i would recommend it to others for the knowledge	2
helpful	2
i am disappointed with the course because of its only focus on apple tv and smartwatch apps the course structure is a bit messy and the content is quite technical dont call it app design since its more app development	0
the lecture videos have a format that is a bit over structured it feels like the instructor takes as much time asking and answering an often contrived motivation question as he does teaching relevant material the slides are of sufficient quality however to make viewing the lectures optional i would have appreciated having all the courses documents in single zip file	3
too easy	1
this requires a high level understanding of maths highest high school level especially si and exponents it is not suitable for people with no background in maths or physics	0
great content invites you to go further on the subjects and shows you a different approach on sustainability design that the one you are used to see in your company or citys vision	3
great information slower to get to the real goals of the course until the second half of it	3
great course thank you tobias and lmu for it	4
i liked the class learned a ton of things and they had us read some very interesting articles	4
terrible course the instructor just read out of the power point no examples or case studies or insightsvery disappointed in the class	0
this is very helpfulthank you very much	4
i found this course lacking in providing sufficient coverage of the basics in the course videos and lacking a useful and directed reading list i spent far too much time researching command syntax and using try and error to find what worked with the provided codedisappointing as topics covered are good	1
all assignments giving you more insight on your personality had to be purchased i did not really feel like a free course  too	0
very good course for the beginners to understand iot concepts	3
great course excellent introduction to graphics design for me as a developer and a nondesigner	4
although this course is admittedly an introduction to ux it is still very underwhelming priced at  the course materials that are spread to  weeks could easily be done in  or maximum  weeks it is hard to justify that for example week  consists of a mins long video and a simple quiz week  is mins overall i felt let down by the lack of materials and assignments no handon experience can be gained no peer graded assignments	0
i am so glad i found this course online	4
the course is well put together however they say you do not need any programming background but you definitely need a little i had to use other sources to help such as codeacademy and udemy just to keep up the do not go over loops conditionals or basic c foundation that would help the leap from html css to javascript is massive they need to relook some of the topics and either more videos or add in some easier teaching methods i took a similar one on udemy that was free just after i completed this one and it was x easier to understand and closed so many loops i had when learning javascript	2
i do love this course	4
this course has little or no information not at all what was advertized too much peer stuff	0
very horrible and boring course poorly designed and the teachers cant even speak properly	0
a very handy course to get a good start with python programming language it is positioned well for the beginner audience	3
tbh this classs experience is not good the lecturers seem unprepared and they talk very repetitively	1
i paid the course and the course seem to be no longer supported i tried without success to switch session  in summary  you paid and dont get to follow the course incredible   	0
valuable and useful info for aspiring business analysts	3
disorganized course materials gaps in the materials	1
great insights immediately applicable	3
while it is a great course for all beginners to the guitar the only problem that i see is the grading system that is absolute loony it is left to other students to grade it and that may or may not show up to be graded by other students if it is not shown up to be graded by other students then you are left gradeless for that assignment hence leaving you unable to complete this course and you cannot receive your certificate or completion letter	1
very bad explanation too boring lectures	0
this course is only supported by a course of data analytics it should clearly state that advanced statistics is a prerequisite knowledge i expected to learn advanced excel techniques not to be required to know statistic models to apply	1
there are some problems of the organization of the course some conditions and some images are missing in quizzes even some videos are missing theres no official response in the forum thanks to the responses of other students in the forum i can finally do some of the quizzes its really frustrating	1
exercises are super challenging but challenging oneself with difficult tasks is the best way to learn its a course worth going for	4
thats a great course for the beginner	4
sorry but the course is very poor ive watched all the videos of the first week and its mostly about nothing and by the way too much stories and im still wondering why simpke brainstorming is called zizozi new approach as it described	0
good introduction to the theme some subjects was not entirely connected between weeks	2
very clear instructions jim really knows about calculus and he knows how to teach well	4
st  weeks were helpful but questions of the quiz were unclear  improvement is really necessary but still an ok course for basic learnersit could be much better	1
very good course	4
hello all im glad i took this course successfully however i have some notes as a th year medical student i see that the information is superficial i finished the course in around  weeks so medical students wouldnt get so much benefit out of the course i wanted to learn more details specially in depth about each type of the  cancers from the basics to clinical secondly there was no interaction between the students and the doctor supervising the course in the discussion blogs thirdly i believe that the assessment was too easy i suggest a  passing grade with a more challenging assessment finally this is my personal opinion i enjoyed the course and i would like to see more improvement in the future	0
it is truly a lot of fun to experiment and to find your own way of designing during this class thank you	4
it gives an idea of how one is prepared to ingress to data science isee that i need to review it more carefully later on	2
this was a very basic course i was expecting something more advanced but all of what was taught was good and clear	2
very good course in particular for international students who have no systematic training on essay writing	4
i really enjoyed this course it is very detailed and the instructions were crystal clear the instructors were very good because they did their best to explain difficult concepts in an easy way also the materials were very helpful and practical to understand the topics	4
i found listening to the instructor just read notes became very tedious very quickly i had to force myself to finish this course which rather defeated my goal of learning for fun the only video that engaged me was the very last one set in the artifact lab i also feel that if you are going to offer transcriptions of the lectures someone should proofread them not to do so is shoddy work and doesnt do coursera or penn any favors	1
i think that this course has wonderful material however i think that more than  people should be required to peer review the assignments so it is a balanced grade in my other classes at least  reviewers are required to review each individual assignment	2
the overall quality of the course is good but in my opinion the level is quite low and there is less content then i expected the assignments are more or less copypaste or very repetitive the  hour work per week are a joke i never needed more than h per week	1
i loved it the ladies did a great job  many thanks 	3
the course offers great ideas to me instead of facts that can be easily checked all history are contemporary history ideas shape and change the socitey	4
the best course	4
terrible nobody seems to monitor the forum no response to questions postedi want to rate zero but there is no such option available	0
for me this course was disappointing here is why first the level at which the course material is presented is very low it might be freshman level but certainly not more there are many buzzwords but no real explanations the programming assignments are only doable because most of the work has been done by the people designing the assignments there is very little left for the students furthermore the procedures that are already given are not very well documented hence a lot of guess work is required to figure out how things should work furthermore little effort has been spent to structure the procedures that are already given altogether this makes doing the programming assignments very unsatisfyingfinally the professor presenting the materials does not take part in the discussion forums contrary to other courses that i have attended at coursera this time the discussion forum was no help at all	0
some typos in the assignments but otherwise very straightforward course with good information  star for not having python  support	3
good material insightful thoughts about starting a business however course material could be better quality looking forward to the following courses	3
very knowledgeable professors but very little explanation or actual teaching graded assignments require a lot of selfeducation	0
lots of slides reading but content is good intro into the field and breaks down the applications real well	2
course contained unbelievable amount of silly busywork that has no place being implemented in matlab while forbidding the use of most useful built in functions at no point during the course was any of the matlabs strengths  like easy solving of linear systems or vectorized operations even suggested uponfurthermore the course has unhealthy interest in dates and calendars  again of course disabling all the built in tools	0
even though i liked how the teacher conducted her course in a dinamic way with  participants i expected more from this course	2
very shallow	1
this course is great if youre just looking for a general overview about entrepreneurship i enjoyed learning about what things to expect as an entrepreneur as well as the dos and donts for running your own business it was really helpful to learn from someone who has real life experience as an entrepreneur	3
its a very instructive course within  days i turned from not knowing anything about adobe illustrator to become very fond of itone caveat though adobe illustrator cc free license only allows you a day of free use not  month as mentioned in the lecture so youd better be able to do all the projects within those  days if you want to use it for free	3
very interesting and informative for anyone interested in music as a vehicle for social justice provides the theoretical and academic background that is often missing from many peoples experiences with music for social justice programming	4
loved it	4
i learned sql by doing projects at work but this sql helps me to learn from very basic to the advanced some questions why this happened at work before was explained well in the class thats true that data in the real world is messy and missing	4
great learning	4
great overview of many models and techniques but very high level would have greatly benefited from links to resources to learn more about all the subjects this course leaves students with only basic knowledge of the subject matter which is fine considering the course timeline but for those who want to explore further please recommend sources of additional reading and research	2
very well paced with very clear explanations and interesting insights	4
there is no subtitles in english for the video lectures and the slides are in chinese	0
overall this course does have some good content and delivers big data concepts however as others have mentioned some content especially in early modules could either be combined or ommited key focus areas on spark and mongodb are not given enough focus and lab timethe quizes have badly worded questions finally the last assignment required to pass the class has bad directions and covers content not reviewed in the class spent a frustrating amount of time trying to get what most likely is simple code to workim hoping this particular module is revised for those just interested in learning spark or mongo and not doing the certificate program you can probably get better learning from doing your own research	1
i did not find that this course added anything to what i already learned seems mainly a rehash of prior material slimly disguising marketing pitch of other northwestern courses	0
difficult to understand the professor and slides were hard to read	1
it was so uneasy to get through this course but i like it	4
steps for exercises are not clear	2
the lectures are insufficient the homework instructions are incorrect the autograder is terrible	0
i dont know what is the problem as i study the videos well and when it come to taking quiz i never pass so i watch the videos over and aver again but it always the same resultthe part of other languages im not sure what is the point of it i mean does it help in english to know how to say for example hi in other languages plz if anyone passed the course  could u plz help me	0
the video lectures provide an introduction to quadrotor flight dynamics and path planning the lectures are okunfortunatelyat least one of the coding assignments has a significant bug in the termination condition the mentors will ignore any help requests that deal with the bug in their codethe assignments involve a lot of hand tuning of pd controllers thats a reasonable task to perform once or twice but it rapidly becomes extremely tedious and detracts from the other materials that are being taughtthe final assignment doesnt do a particularly good job evaluating the required test conditionif you do take the course id want you to knowyou should expect to modify the provided code to fix their bugsthere are no gotcha quiz questions if you are confused by getting a question wrong you might want to retry your answer there seems to be a bug in the way at least one quiz question is set upon the final assignment you can modify the simulation step where it makes things run in real time removing that step makes the simulation run much more quickly and allows for faster iterationto concludethis is a course with a lot of potential but unless coursera makes an effort to improve the course i would not recommend it	0
coursera lost my thoughtful star review so i am replacing it with this i learned a lot through my own efforts and through the efforts of students who bothered to post in the forums the one mentor disappeared halfway through the course	0
i found it very hard to understand the lecturers and what they were saying	0
this course is a rehash of both the excellent functional programming principles in scala and the mediocre principles of reactive programming in scala unfortunately in quality its closer to the latter mixed quality lectures that seem unrelated to their corresponding assignments many errors both typos and more seriously examples that dont typecheck and a general lack of an indepth motivation for the principles staff participation in my run of the course  was disappointingly low in some cases there was no response at all to students pointing out glaring errors in the lecturesits very noticeable that this course is a patchwork of previous courses in same cases the video lectures even display the wrong title for the course or mention lectures that no longer exist in this version of the coursethe course has interesting parts i was especially thrilled when i saw there were lectures about frp but its quality is way below functional programming principles in scala im disappointedto make this review constructive my recommendations pay attention to quality make sure all examples compile and typecheck make sure youre not repeating content already in other courses especially if they are part of the same specialization if youre going to reuse content from other contents make sure it fits the current course do not mention lectures not in the course	1
videos arent of good quality and the tools arent concrete enough to be useful there is not enough material i hope they will improve it because the subject is interesting	0
mostly just an ad for the instructors startup very annoying	0
this is very good	4
boring and helpless	0
interesting topic however i quitted video lectures were recorded almost phrase by phrase making it too hard to follow the contents properly	0
the teachers and instructors really should make better videos and stop giving peer edit assignment when people are picky and do not grade your assignment the instructors should also give their contacts to let their students contact them when the discussion forums dont work	0
course quality went downhill compared to previous course in series no teacher involvement in comments  questions mistakes within quizzes both practice and rated	2
this is an interesting course containing all the necessary basics for someone interested in project management the instructor supports all the concepts with good use of interesting examples i enjoyed this course thoroughly	3
very well organized course short and to the point	3
super wonderful class very educational and enjoyable i collected more books after this class and reread many of them recommend the love artist featured in one of the sessions	4
each week is a very light overview of a topic there is little to no connection between the topics the course is not rigorous enough i felt at the end of the course i didnt learn anything	0
the classes are not practical and the voice of the teacher is very monotone boring	1
it is not entry course please be well prepared	2
lots of good material though i dont like how theyve repackaged the original material from the prior longer version which i worked through at my own pace a year ago off session cramming all the material relating to nosql and graph analytics into the final week without assignment is ineffective instead consider focusing the th week on nosql and keep an assignment with it maybe even the original pig assignment that required and aws account i dont think the nominal charge amazon will levy would hold anybody up whos serious about learning to process data at scale its just a few bucks	2
good course	4
the concepts taught were very useful and interesting but the only drawback i found with this course was the confusing nature of the miniproject	2
great course 	3
the course is good but id like a more complicated one this is too easy	2
this course needs alot more examples especially where the statistical tools come into play it would better to separate consumer behaviour and market research as different courses basically too much theory and too little practice	1
the peer reviewed assignments are next to useless as there is no oversight on them i think there needs to be a basic comprehension assessment done first before allowing fellow learners the ability to passfail students in the course	0
the best decision that i made was when i decided to take this course	4
i have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities but this course is clearly biased the sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest a university is meant to teach the whole story and have a truthful account of facts i am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals on the pretext of unbiased learning this course clearly has an agenda i hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not	0
this is ok if you know absolutely nothing about nutrition otherwise its basically information id expect to be relayed to kindergarteners	1
thank you for conducting this valuable course	4
instructor is not clear and too fast	0
for me this kind of teaching is not very useful i will want to learn more abou grammar so i can make sentences with sense alone and of course more of phonetics the teacher was great she speaks very clear and explain well	2
mr harris is great a lot of course content could be as a prerequisite for example basic control structures of the python could been left out just having a reference to material describing them i hope following course will focus more on raspberry pi specifics	2
excellent the subject is clearly and concisely produced and delivered the readings are spot on worth every minute	4
very good introduction the text is confusing at times but thats just part of learning new language	4
eventhough my english language is not strong i just can complete this course as requirement excellent thank you very much	4
illusion of competence and imposter syndrome are two phases that is very importance for me to better know myself 	4
love this course love the teacher she makes grammar easy	4
videos mostly show lecturers talking to camera	1
nothing is making sense none of the videos are related to the quiz none of the examples are remotely related to the quiz to even give you a suggestion on how to solve them	0
excellent course overall only issue was the inaccurate instructions for those using sklearn instead of graphlab with graphlab its very easy to do but a bit painful for those like me who like to write a program instead of doing in interactive mode only	3
cheap  just money involved in each subsectionswhich r the most interesting parts	0
not very practical	0
poor structuring of assignments unclear objectives and wrong input datacourse content was good	2
wish they gave more clear information on the calcuations	2
the course and indeed the whole specialization was advertised as not requiring the graphlab create toolkit this is untrue as the final programming assignment does require it the general dependence on sframe is understandable since it is open source but requiring any interaction with a licensed product even if temporary and research licenses are available greatly negatively impacted my experience in this course	0
the instructors are very knowledgeable but the course seems to have the  we just threw this together at the last minute feel many of the quizzes are very poorly worded the final project is a bit of a disaster as some of the reviewers are unable to unzip a generic gz file and you can end up getting  points from those particular incompetent types	1
another fantastic module by excellent tutor	4
no ancillary reading material or text to help along with the assignments lead me to fail the course	0
not that interestingmany buzz words little knowledge	0
i think the teacher was very welcoming but the content was less than enough to answer the quizzes in the quizzes every answer choice was correct and there wasnt any possible way to discern what the teacher said and complemented with the lectures didnt match with the question answers so my score is 	1
much of the lecture material seemed very choppedup from previous courses and did not flow well at all in a couple of cases the assignment had very little relationship with the course material from the same week	2
nice start with python 	4
completing this course helped me improve both my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in ms excel discover exciting new tools and technics for modeling thanks a lot	3
again the content and presentation is greatbut the web site is getting really annoying especially in the assignment area the editor is faulty and on the submission on visualization you cannot use visualizations to make your point due to technical limitations cant paste charts or screenshotssometimes verification does not worksupport is sometimes very good sometimes useless depends with whom you chat	1
good materials but too long and drawn out	2
to much disconnect between assignments and lectures	2
excellent easy to understand for starters	3
an excellent foundation and insight to business strategy very clearly and concisely presented	4
good introduction to bayesian concepts but the course would benefit of some rethought of design of exercises	1
excellent class dr chuck is a phenomenal teacher if charles severance teaches it then you should take it	4
not explained well had to take another statistical inference course not worth the money	0
so far the course is just a tutorial for using scratch and theyre not teaching how to program that is the name of the course	1
the only thing i had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python  code to  as thats what im usingpresentations didnt add much towards the learning either definite downgrade from previous courses especially from the first three	1
simplistic but so easy for anyone to watch and learn i wish more people would take this course	2
there are so little video tutorials and too many exercises without video instructions	2
it is more like a junit course in the beginning or as far as i could watch the methodology is not very precise and i could think in a few enhancementsstill i could recommend for those who want just a initial contact with the method no more than this	0
i would really love to take this course as i m currently a computer science and thanks for granting me this course yuhuuuuu	3
very basic introduction having said that i couldnt really recommend it to someone without any prior experience most concepts were glanced over for someone without prior experience the material would be too demanding but for people with experience eg me it was too easy even though i had no ruby  rails experience	2
just basic stuffs d	3
laid a very good foundation in introducing terms concepts and philosophies of the global business environment	3
terrible course assignments are extremely buggy and often touches on things not even explained in the lectures mentors are not active explanations are sketchy and not well paced do this course only for the examples in the jupyter notebook	0
best class in the series yet	4
the assignments were challenging and cool lot of selfstudy needed to crack them the lecture videos could have been a bit more interesting	3
good overview of how to make graphs	3
a little bit old and too many references to others courses	0
pretty good in overall but there are a few points that could be improved the content is taught in a weird order and the difficulty doesnt increase steadily for example week  and  feel like they have been made separately and about the same subject but week  goes further the last video of week  is interesting but it seems improvised there could be more examples especially from modern music john from week  uses examples from the beatles which is great but hes the only one week  has pretty much no examples at all suppplementary material and notes are uneven from week to week week   and especially  have good summaries of the videos and examples but week  almost only has links to wikipedia the final exam is very difficult there are some crazy chords and rhythm to analyse and there are advanced questions on points which have been seen very quickly in the videosi cant really compare since i new some of the content of the class but i think its weel made for beginners as well as for intermediate musicians but youll probably need to do a bit of research yourself if you want to be ready for the exam	2
this course is clearly signposted as being supported by the templeton foundation and it shows the course is short in terms of length and weak in the terms of developing ideas the designers do not seem to understand properly what science is and what scientists do this is particularly evident in the final week an incoherent ramble the course strengthens my positive opinions of feynmans view of the philosophy of sciencein general i enjoy edinburgh universitys coursera courses but i shall be wary of any of a similar ilk and certainly wont buy the certificate this time	0
i did not found this course much useful i expected more detailed examples of worldbuilding but talks were quite vague and unspecific sit think about this go learn about that	1
very practical tips for managing your time and being in control of your workflow versus it controlling you	4
course stuff could have better interaction and response time and grading could be more challenging	3
the course is good	3
very bad introduction to python and almost nothing about raspberry pi itself	0
quizzes are trivial makes the certification worthlessprof campbell is not a good lecturerthe topics are treated mostly superficially then suddenly go into too much detail sometimes how to use intellij idea machine learningsubtitles are very buggyi enjoyed mr farivars talks much more it seems like he knows what he is talking about and his presentations are well structured	1
pity that people had to spend more time on making the plugins work than actually doing the exercisesassignments but good content nonetheless	2
not such a great course lectures dont cover what is needed in some assignments week  assignment was the hardest i ever took just plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you there is a lot of space to improve this course	2
better than the first course of the specialization but the concepts are still explained not clearly	1
starts off great but quickly jumps into really dense course material moving quickly between topics with few images or examples while watching the lecturer slowly scribble on the slides i expected more discussions in the videos with variance between visual heavy calculations at a slower pace and highlevel applications quizzes are long and redundant and there isnt enough recognition of the relationship between climate change and thermodynamics	1
nice tutorials and precise explanations	4
its a very superficial course it feels like the instructor is just reading out from some material and it is not making it interesting to listen the instructor is not putting in much effort to make student understand the concept thats the reason for me to drop out in between the course this course is not at all much informative and neither it is improving my grasp on the topic	0
overall this class was a good starting point for basics of finance but coming from an ivy league school it could stand a bit more polish and professionalism especially if yale university expects people to pay for the class and their accreditationthe instructor has an odd speech manner which takes a little bit of time to get used to but doesnt detract from the materialthe tests are not difficult but the questions are often poorly phrased such as questions that ask you what a certain term of art is while none of the answer choices are descriptions of the term of art and the correct answer is an application of the term that does not actually answer the call to questionmost of the videos are cobbled together excerpts from lectures the professor previously gave as such they cut out randomly have issues with the sound volume and often discuss material that was cut out prior to the section or should come later but never does not the biggest problem once you get used to it because the course is an overview but its still kind of annoying and not very professional compared to other courses availablethe instructor is clearly very procapitalism which is a mixed bag on one hand hes very knowledgable and communicates a lot of really good information on the other hand hes also very clearly biased bordering on utopic about the benefits of capitalism and glossing over a lot of the down side risks that are inherent in finance to be clear this criticism is not of the professor or to say that down side risk and risk management are not sufficiently discussed but merely that imho the course could benefit from more discussion and material on the negative aspectsramifications of unfettered capitalism especially given the large amount of time spent discussing the  recessionall that being said i learned a lot from this course and found it very interesting and informative while i have a prior basis in the material that helped i learned a lot of new things and still came away with a better understanding of finance and the international financial system i would recommend anyone who wants to expand or create a knowledge basis in finance and financial institutions take this course	2
the lectures are unpolished and hard to follow especially as the captions are inaccurate the mathematics in the course are not explained clearly	0
this course was very disappointing and much of the content in the tests and course did not show up in the course project i felt like the course project was far more advanced than all the other detail in addition there was minimal to no detail on instruction very poor development here and i would not recommend it to anyone all you need to do is look at all the threads of complaints i am looking forward to the next python course and h	0
nice course with lot of numbers and facts	2
cheesy if you mess up in your delivery press the little button and start over needs some judicious editing	1
the professor is reading long texts it is not really attractive	1
this is an amazing interesting course i never thought that learning about hitler and the origins of the holocaust would become an interest but its really great and the teacherprofessor explains it so well	2
i enjoy the course  and i learn new things	3
very easy to understand	2
dato tool does not even install properly so nmakes no sense to continue with the course the support team fail to help in installing  	0
this is the first course that will only let you grade the quiz if you purchase the course highly disappointed	0
i found this course truly inspiring particularly because i hail from the cape flats in south africa and have knowlege of although i dont completely pretend to understand the manifestations discussed by marlon and the rlabs teami also understand that the problem is a transhistorical culturalstructuralpsychologicalphysical one and my interest is to understand these problems in its structure so that it can be dealt with in its structure and not only in terms of individual manifestations as this course attempts to doi do however find that dealing with our interconnected problems in its structure is an uphill battle and i am keen to try out the advice given in the course to see at least if a dent can be made however smallthanks and all the best dr sarah henkeman	4
all in all i liked the course its easy to comprehend and well structured nevertheless i missed the lecurer id really liked that the lectured didnt read the script but retold it in the camera it would be more of a face to face communication besides some interviews would be nice	2
html and css classes were great but javascript classes were very confusing and difficult to understand	1
the lecture is too general not a courser for beginners but if your are not a beginner you wont need this so	1
good background for nonexperts but just an introductory course	3
this course if difficult but is very valuable	4
very short quality of the course is ok	2
interesting approach	3
since i was a child i liked to help my mom and my grandmother to cook they taught me to cook and i learned the traditions of the family my two younger children were picky eaters and at the beginning it was very tough to prepare food for them now we enjoy together to prepare and eat different types of food we love our traditional food but we are always looking for new recipes this course teaches me how to combine different types of ingredients to bring to our table every day more balanced and healthy food	4
i cannot complete the course due to installations problem of the software required even if i have all the requirements needed on my laptop	0
i dont know how useful the ambiguous requirements exercise is when we only have oneway feedback i also think that the ambiguous requirements exercise is the most important of the course and the exercise missed the marki would suggest you structure that exercise as a dialogue where a pm is working with the customer to elicit requirements and not give us a big long wishlist of functionality structured as a dialogue you can show that a pm would ask you said that the game would make noise when is the first time it makes noise how often would game noises be made does it ever stop what makes it stop why even have the game make noise in the first place are there different noises made during the course of game playso i cant recommend this particular course and im concerned about what the capstone will look like if you give us an assignment where were to make sense of functionality delivered as a block of text 	0
all the information learned from this course are hard to be forgotten cause they all are advises for us to get better memory	4
it is too basic content i cant imagine an specialization with material that basic	1
might be an instructive course but the guy who presents it is really creepy and knowing he was involved in the official  report makes him hard to believe on any issue	1
although courseware video is well doneassigment are poorly designed and imbalancedfar too easy on end of each weeklast week final assignment overly difficult and poorly guidedthe sense of progress is very small after completing the coursebiology meets programming from ucsd is better designed on pedagogy and code challenges levelcant recommend not worth investing time or  bucks	1
the course is interesting and might be useful for complete strangers in the world of fitnessphysical activity as it provides some general ideas about implementing activity to ones daily life as well as gives a good understanding on stating achievable goals for those who have the essential knowledge of all that the course would be a repetition of the basics the most useful part seems to be about the goal setting and that is what id recommend to start with for most students the course wont be useful for fitnesssports professionals followup emails for many months after the course ends seem to start turning somewhat annoying the quality on the videos sound especially is often a bit on the poor side	1
bad sound quality	0
course and assignments were good but dont hope for an answer in the discussion forums	2
well course well explained it starts from the very basics for those ones that does not know much about web development	3
i am afraid this is only two stars from me for now it is a course with great content and a lot of potential but the way how it is delivered can be greatly improved to make it easier to understand and more engaging i just hope the team do not give up but improve this to be one of the best courses on coursera  it can well be	1
each week was only about an hour most mooc courses ive taken have at least  to  hours of content and learning very little learning for a  week course this is a  week course stretched out to  weeks	1
i would like more content from this module it was very slow to take off especially week one it was easy and enjoyable though i would have liked it to be more challenging	2
instructor and textbook do a very nice job of using the students intuition to explain probability theory	4
not recommended at all she gets some things right but really wastes the opportunity to drill the most fundamental and important point about philanthropy namely that the most important factor in assessing a nonprofits value is effectiveness and nonprofits vary in their effectiveness by many orders of magnitude furthermore a small number of charity evaluators and meta charities have identified those charities which most effectively address the most common values of aspiring philanthropistsi dont recommend this course for anyone rather i would strongly encourage anyone seriously interested giving to check out peter singers course effective altruism	0
before this course the topic of philosophy had never appealed to me while from now on it turns out to be an interesting subject a wonderful introduction to ancient philosophy of greece 	3
the greatest lecture ever made for computer composition principles	4
good and brilliant one	3
great course the only change i would ask for after the test could you let us see the correct response to the questions we got wrong thanks	3
i want to give it   starts  sometimes the modules seem really segmented and you spend half the time repeating the same ideas or recapping the course material that was new that weekwhile the assessment tasks were great exercises the fact that theyre peerreviewed means that the feedback you get is often unhelpful or poorly informedit was a good course to do but i dont think its really going to change anyones life and i would encourage people to not take the peer feedback too seriously	2
i didnt find this module very helpful and some of the assignments were truly confusing i wish there was more meat in the sessions and more availability to access the lecturers more readily when there was confusion i dont like the fact i pay money for other people to assess my work when half of them dont even read my submissions properly or the question or both so if the lectures dont stretch me i find my money spent unwisely	1
a bit boring but still informative	2
very basic all this information of this course can be self taught by googling and the hands on exercise at the end of the course is a joke for the  price of the course expected more	0
overall this course was a great introduction to the basic web programming languages for someone with little to no experience my only issue was that the assignments could have been more challenging and one in particular was not put together properly by the instructors missing information to complete assignment this has since been fixed	3
good until now thank you	3
these themes felt very surfacelevel and redundant the material could likely have been covered more quickly and allowed for more time to be spent on more tangible every day information that might help those that are not already teachers	1
the course is very thorough and well explained it lays out the steps for optimizing a website for search in clear terms	4
very poor material and instruction videos with no logical flow or process	0
it is good but a lot more citations and examples could be included	2
like an advertismentwhy not use pandas and numpy sklearnopen source is more popular	1
well taught course but the material for the homework assignments were basically given to us the answers were handed to us in the homework description having said this the assignments were good one should have basic program	3
the content is good but is too focus in the  act structure and dont explain the narration techniques specifically to videogames genres the assignments were too repetitives and dont add variety or feeling of progression through the course i recommend the course for who dont know the basis of the narrative structure but not for people like me who work in the audiovisual world	1
boring	0
very interesting course if you want to have an overview of how climate works you will understand what we know but most importantly what we do not know on the subject sadly there was no feedback at all from teachers	2
a good course for persons those who are employed as in security role to an any organisation i appreciate the method of distance learning to all on online thanks	3
in terms of content the course is superficial and weak its also too much focused on promote cruyff event and institute	0
this course was actually quite helpful for learning chinese and it provides fascinating information about chinese culture besides learning the language youll learn about holidays foods and art and youll hear chinese musicunfortunately i could not give the course a good rating because i found some quiz questions impossible to complete this questions required answers to be typed in pinyin or in chinese characters however the course gave no information on how to type the pinyin tone marks or chinese characters into the response boxes i tried asking about this in a discussion forum but got no answer	1
really didnt like the course	0
very good and interesting course i recommend	4
interesting but the assignments were a bit dull learned a bit more about python	2
the git and github section is not very clear	2
great opportunity to learn java and put it into use to solve the real world problems but its a little hard for people who havent learned java at all but only learned cobjectoriented programming	3
extremely useful course to understand the fundamentals of machine learning professor andrew n g explains the concepts in a simple and easy language which strengthens the understanding	4
i appreciate the effort of the professor and the university but i found this course extremely theoretical  research is a practical thing that a pr practitioner should know how to do in practice i understand that all courses should have an introduction and presentation of basic concepts but i dont see myself getting very far with this knowledge of research	1
the entirety of this course is watch and listen there are no handson activitiesassignments that get you implementing what you are supposedly learning the assignments that are offered are optional and consist of filling in the blank code without actually providing you a way to see how your code works in the big picturefor example  they go on and on about how intents are complicated and tricky but they dont actually give you a required assignment its optional then the actual assignment is do this here and this here and then this here and only when you have completed every step can you actually run the code but this doesnt actually show you how to build the intent all you did was write down what they told you to and where you never actually build anything yourself you dont actually get an idea of how these things work or how to implement them yourself from scratchthe quizzes are also pointless every quiz is multiple choice select all that apply theres no thought required just regurgitation of info from the lecturesalso the entire week  lectures are horrible the lectures on git are sssoooo dull that i could not stay awake no matter how much i wanted to they are given in a monotone bored tone that will drive you insaneoverall this course seems more like it was hastily slapped together without much thought and then never looked at again i would not recommend anyone take this course let alone pay for it	0
  good but i feel some of the explanations were over complicated a little compared to other coursers such as openintro to stats overall good experience though	2
a fascinating course but delivered in a rather wooden fashion by the lecturer good illustrations i would have liked to have known more of the overall value if any of the jewish contribution in the context of chinese economic development ie was it of any overall importance did it make any difference is it still relevant	2
there are some inconsistencies in the course or the arrangement of the videos maybe due to technical problemsfor improvement i would really wish to have some substantial results especially in the last week of the course that is i would prefer to discuss at least something in depth rather than everything broadly	3
i liked the way mr skyhorse explains the secrets to construct a great plot it was excellent in every sense of the word however my only complain of this course its that you cant report those funny peers that write reviews like this one  its so unfair that some of us the real students took our time to write detailed reviews about every peer assignment and expected at least words as reviews you need to implement some kind of report system to ban those funny peers that only check your work to put the point and to get their course done and to start that system i will tell you thatshokry mohamed fathallah el sayarthat guy gave me reviews as i described before not only in this course but in the craft of character so please someone needs to make justice and punish this guy i can even send you captions of his reviews	3
great materials variety of speakers lecturesexamples and models  thank you	3
really good course easy understanding and well explained as well concepts very useful for professional and personal lifei recommend to everyone who are often envolved with people	3
i like this so far and have been using some of the information in my other class on software security	3
this course is very good easy to understand	4
excelent course thanks for your time	4
good but many complaints regarding pid tuning from students need to be addressed in the upcoming sessions	2
great intro to r swirl programming studio is amazing and so easy to use	4
this class is more of a marketing  class than a digital marketing class interesting and probably a great class for someone looking for the basics of marketing	1
the transition is from easy to advanced it gets really confusing not sure if its just me i am not following the lessons anymore so i left the course	1
very helpful thanks	4
the course is best suited for an intermediate student course is good to have since oit convers the topic from its very basic perspective for graduates this course is more time consuming and dosnt recommendedadvantagesvery simple descriptionseven a non mathematical background student can easily understandproofs in all formsgeometric analatic practical descritiondisavbasic are explained and consuming too much timedosnt going for advanced levelno high level explanations or topics	2
very inspiring everyone must take these courses very good	4
i think this course might have been great if i did it like th or th in the certificate sequence i think this course assumes you have a lot of knowledge about both biology and statistics that i do not have nor will anyone else who has only taken the first intro course even after having submitted my final assignment and peer reviewing others it is not clear whether or not i or any of my classmates used the correct methods to complete the assignment a valid solution to the final project hasnt even been given to us as part of the course so ill never know whether or not i did it correctly	1
i was very disappointed because in order for me to move to the next module i have to pay to unlock some of the course materials coursera is changing i understand that in order to maintain such a big structure is expensive however it wasnt clear to me from the beginning that i have to pay to unlock the nd module courses	0
itd be  if it used scikitlearn instead of proprietary software albeit with yr free to use license for noncommercial purposes	3
it was quick but i was expecting some more views and videos of other professionals to get the additional learning	2
great introduction to generic machine learning conceptsone suggestion to the teachers would be to include an optional programming section just to introduce graphlab to users there is a lot of api calls which are explained on the go but a high level view of the library with the relevant structuring of apis would be helpful	3
i am half way through this course but i am enjoying every bit learning this course and the way it is setup i learn more and more every step along the way big thanks and congratulations to coursera  people at stanford who put this course up in way to make machine learning so much fun to learn	4
poor lectures by one of the instructors makes it hard to listen	0
all theory quizzes you were left with the task of answering questions based on models never seen or explained spent most time trying to make sense of them final project is almost a joke to try and decipher how to create from scratch based on the ones they provided in the quizzes its not a joke but it is very difficult when the actual excel and model making isnt part of the lectures	1
i like making game after this course	4
very interesting usefull entretaining and fresh totally recomended	4
whats there is ok but there is only a few minutes of lecture material each week	1
instructor mostly reads off the slides some explanations are too short cant connect on any level with the instructor stars is for the course content	1
hasta ahora he aprendido varios detalles de las configuraciones de java que desconocia ya en ocaciones anteriores que he intentado desarrollar una aplicacion para android utilizando otras herramientas pero existen muy poca ayuda o me han parecido muy confusas las explicaciones que he econtrado en este curso de android las explicaciones me han resultado muy claras y sencillas	4
dont know how to apply the statistics and excel formula in real world situation besides it becomes focus on approving statistics equation than teaching data analysis in excel	0
i learned next to nothing from this course the professor just rambles on and on jumping schizophrenically from aspect of aspect one moment hes talking about physics and in the same sentence hes suddenly talking about whether the game should have a crafting system some of the information even seems out of touchhe doesnt state any information with certainty because he always tends to add or not or maybe after sentences leaving you to wonder if theres anything left to take away from the lessons the entire course could be condensed down into a list of questions to think about while designing your game world  it really doesnt contain anything more than thatsometimes entire segments are dedicated to trivial things such as your game could have invisible walls whereas in other segments he works through a hundred different questions without going indepth to any of themspeaker is hard to understand due to his lack of proficiency with the english language and the subtitles are often incorrecton the plus side you will learn what a haha is	0
good overview of narrative and a breakdown of key story elements such as character and setting	2
pretty decent class but zero communication if i could give that part a negative score i would actually an imaginary number would be better there are a few incorrect lecture links and errors on tests that have been pointed out dozens of times over several years now and nothing has been done whatsoever was also horribly misleading by stating that it was certificategranting when it was not partially not totally fixed now but it really screwed one person i know luckily the grade sheet seems to be sufficient proof for my purposes but if you are looking for resume material go elsewhere for pure passive learning i would give  stars but the lack of any instructor interaction at all and the obvious lack of attention to consistent and totally correct calls to fix simple errors for years nowdrags it down to  stars in my book still not bad as long as you know what you are going into i did learn a decent amount cant deny that at all but dont expect even the tiniest effort from anyone to help you with anything under any circumstance	2
super course thanks	4
good build up	4
for me it is easier to grasp algorithms that are written out than audiovideo description i would have given  stars if the course material accommodated different learning styles for each chapter i had to do a fair amount of searching for information on the a star search algorithm to the understand the subtle details	3
i feel that this specialization is not focused enough on developing portfolio pieces one portfolio piece at the end of an month course does not seem adequate to me so i wish we focused more on developing high fidelity work  in addition to the needfinding user research sketches short weekly assignments this high fidelity digital work could even be optional but i need some guidance on what work to develop and how the overall process should lookeven being allowed to enroll in the capstone before completing the first  sections would be helpfulthe review is kind of about what you are looking to get out of these classes if you just want to learn about ux and human centered design then its a  star course but if you want to produce some great work that will help you land a job in the industry it might not be for you	1
quite interesting and informative course	3
content is too basic seems unresearched instructor is distracting in manner in which he presents information  overemphasizes acting over content	0
in this capstone project youre given a framework to work with and asked to create an app with pretty minimal required criteria the problem is theres very little instructions or support so it feels like a classroom where the instructor said do whatever you want and walks out of the door overall the specialization feels illorganized and of questionable quality and there are plenty of negative sentiments in the forums	0
maybe it would be better to add more exercises to assimilate better the content same as previous courses in the specialization	3
the given introduction didnt help me to figure out how the grading system will look like there are no assignments to submit only online group works which is not organised well at all there are too many threads and the its not at all clear what to write about apparently i should write about certain cases but i couldnt find the content of the case there is no proper introduction work overview or anything very dissapointing	0
this could probably be compressed into a single week of setup for the r programming course there isnt much in terms of substantive learning here	1
i find this course very useful and helpful its is a core to data analysis using excel and i learned a lot	3
great course for java developer	4
perfect course good lecture nice knowlage	4
excelent mooc for those who want to build quality relations	4
the material was beneficial but i would have found the course more helpful if there were weekly assignments rather than one assignment at the end of the course that incorporated all of the principles	1
great teacher	4
the course is good but in my opinion its too basic for people who are already developers in platforms other than ios hopefully the next course in the serie will be a little bit deeper	3
very interesting and i continuing to learn	3
the course was informative and some of the material regarding databases will be useful towards my current job however i felt that in classes  and  python was really an after thought i believe i could have completed this course without ever taking the first two classes because the assignments only required slight modifications to existing code i was more analyzing patterns rather then truly understanding the code i would rather see the course continue to expand upon basic programing knowledge so that i can write the code by myself instead of seeking examples to cutpaste all the time	1
review commentswhat i learn most form this course is parallel structure and sentence variety lessons in week parallel structureit uses some conjunctions like and but bothand not onlybut alsosentence varietyuse the different  types english sentence style simple compound complex and compoundcomplex to enrich your writing in addition adverbs prepositional phrases like in the morning other transitions furthermore could be used to create variety at last combining the short sentences medium sentences  words and long ones  words will also make your writing alive some other tips will also help like repeating key nouns using synonyms saying things in different ways use different sentence types start sentence differently use different sentence lengths use synonyms effectivelyconsidering sentence variety will be the last step when you revise your essay so do not do it in the begining	2
the cousre is wonderful and practical however would be more practical as soon as you provide a list of tool that are popular for marketer in digital planning either in a template form or in a case study	3
i am a little disapointed with this course i have completed the third week but quizes are too big and the questions are almost impossible to compare with the lecturesit seems like what is evaluated is your ability of getting languages nuances and not the epidemiology subject	1
the lectures and assignments questions are more about the history of the internet and html although ive finished the course but it wasnt as good as i thought	1
not the quality i expected the capstone project should have been little more challenging and something new	1
missing course material about how calculating fact table size ans sparsity	2
great course	3
the course is very useless there is no meat only water  there is no substance  only talking around the topic i am appalled that such research exists and ashamed for the coursera	0
only shows a bit of javascript css and html snippets if you expect to learn from this course dont bother they mostly refer you to wschoolscom they assume everyone knows how to code in html javascript and css at one point in the course the teacher says if you dont know google yahooetc but if you are going to have to google  of things its pointless taking this course	0
without a comprehensive background in thermodynamics which i do not have advanced mathematics and statistics this course is extremely hard to impossible to follow formulas come out of nowhere and the explanation of the conceptual theory is very thin	1
unnecessary video segment at the start of each lecture is annoying and a total waste of time the content of the course lacks in substance compared to the an introduction to american law course so much time spent on european effect on british law this is not a course for lawyers i would presume but supposed to be an introduction	1
i do not want to rate this course at this stage but i would like to make the following comment in relation to the course resources and in particular the answers to the exercises in the optional text bookfor students who do not have a copy of the text book providing answers to questions from the text book without showing the actual questions is not very useful and to be quite frank ridiculous i would like to think that the course designers would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy thishow exactly this would be done is up to the course designers but i would suggest that another downloadable pdf document showing all the questions would be extremely useful and necessaryi look forward to a responseregards trevor farley	0
interesting to learn about the modern us diet and why it doesnt work i thought it was a great intro course on benefits of eating at home but more important eating meals cooked at home	3
the final lab had an error that took a long time to find a solution for which was disappointing for a paid course you would expect the labs to be better quality tested	2
great perspectives and multiple techniques	4
completely irrelevant material	0
feedback for the developed business model is missing and thus sigificant addedvalue cannot be captured	1
very unprofessional compared to other courses it wasnt well organized	1
the content was great the presentation was a bit dry but i feel i got a lot out of this course	3
easy to follow and a nice difficulty ramp so you never feel youre in too deep	4
it is a good course the teacher is amazing the teacher theaches us a lot about control	3
very nice course with solid foundation and great examples one recommendation would be to split the material on week  into  weeks week  and week  the teachers would have more time for explaining every bit in the lectures so the difficulty would step up evenly between weeks other than the amount of material on last week it is a good course and highly recommended	3
the content of this course is very good however i feel it is unfortunate that the lecturer did not make an effort in preparing the presentation of the material this makes a huge difference especially when it is an online course the lecturer needs to bring the story to life rather than simply reading with hesitation from the slides in most instances	2
if you have any experience with websites this course is not for you it is merely about the soft stuff got a couple of nice links to color scheme generator et cetera but did not deliver what i thought it promised	0
adequate course for nonprofessionals in finance although i thought they were going to explain many more themes to short for my expectations and excesive for the price	2
david is the kind of professor that could make you change your major just to be in his classes this course is incredibly well written intuitive and amazing	4
hated the course and the content i truly regret investing my money on this course	0
all this peer grading nonsense is garbage if we are gonna pay  a month of something we can at least get the proper grading system included	0
this course should not be presented by video i loose lot of time by learn with others supports than courseraeven if i notice and appreciate the works to produce these supports by the teacher im not a big fan at all	1
all information was presented with a scientific backup and from multiple points of viewthis is a fundamental course to anyone that wants to have a continuous learning process the curricula and extra documentation its design to facilitate a long term acquisition of information	3
while course uses a genie method for presentation the content quizzes are just made to accomplish one goal to make sure you have memorized every small detail haven said in the course even if someone memorizes the details like specific names and dates for how long heshe is going to keep it in mind  days on week	1
html and css were excellentim sure this is a great course for people with some coding background but as a complete beginner to javascript and coding i found it nearly impossible to comprehend the rd and th weeks because we jumped in to jquery without first getting to know javascriptyes  the quizzes were too easy  i passed all of them even when i wasnt understanding most of the materiali went over to codeacademy and microsoft virtual academy to get a better foundation in js then came back and was able to understand a bit better as for me i am going to spend more time learning and practicing jsjq before moving on to the next course in this specialization	2
this course is really helpful for beginners also i enjoyed the assignments	4
lectures add very little to what you get simply by looking at the slides on your own facilitators are expert biostatisticians not r programmers and sometimes their explanations of r functionality is superficial and imprecise the assignments are rigorous and challenging however and if you take the time to go through all of the exercises you will gain valuable knowledge	2
it was a brilliant course we get to learn so much to improve ourselves i enjoyed it 	3
assignments not always in line with lecturematerial is above beginner level	0
really enjoying the course good information presented well and access to excellent reading materials	3
really very basic anyone with an interest in the subject is likely to know most of this already nicely presented though good quality videos	1
best course in the specialization so far well thought out and explained the course still has the same problem with quiz questions being at times obtuse but overall its a really good course	3
lots of very general review information not much new stuff did force me to start getting familiar with github	2
very disappointing poorly written quizes and presentations the level of the course is far too basic to be of value but is required for the specialization why not offer an option to test out of basic introduction courses	0
this class is far too theoretical and abstract you only have to get  to pass the quizzes which indicates how difficult it is to understand the material	1
while the lectures were good one of the mentors wasnt profesional at all she was nasty though the other one was very finebut my chief complaint is the terrible method in creative writing classes only  of using peer reviews to pass the class i had a nonenglishspeaking person not pass me a former english teacher for no other reason than he misread the assignment so i had to resubmit i dont know who finally passed me i think the peer review process is a shambles and it lets coursera personnel out of the process of doing grading and opens a can of worms with an incompetent peer reviewer having the power to not pass me i dont think i will be taking creative writing classes again at coursera as going through that broken peer review process and having one mentor being off the wall just wasnt worth my time and anxiety	1
it is a very good course it help the beginner understand more what is photography	3
this was more objective than i thought nevertheless the information about the zionism refute itself and make us criticize about the dangerous notion	0
the teaching quality is very average and mediocre at bestthe assignments are merely implementation of lectures the stanford and princeton courses on algorithms are better courses to take for one to pursue a serious study of algorithms	1
this course is not really free you must pay to access quizzes and peer graded assignmentscoursera is really moving downhill quickly in terms of free course offerings its such a pity	0
just good to catch the basics sometimes quite boring to follow the professor but it covers the basics adequately	2
definitely improved from the first course of this specification better feedback on errors regarding quizzes questions and still really interesting assignments for peer review that help you to learn still missing a document or a file with all the notes that one can take away and use as a reference guide hence only 	2
my initial impressions are of astounding mediocrity amazes me how academic careers are made these days	0
good introduction to spark one thing that i didnt like was use of simple ints and strings instead of types	3
highly recommended	4
nonrich course	0
this course is an easy to follow introduction into the world of pfa based on a well constructed rapid model and taught by an experienced professor the nature of presentation using a clear introduction into the topic being taught a lecture on the topic and clinical vignettes of the right or wrong way to implement what is being taught allow a variety of learners to come away with understanding	4
course contents are not very well organized	2
appears more like a revision for those who already know the content than geared towards those new to the subject	1
this course being an introductory to specialization doesnt stand so good alone what i really liked were the realworld examples of companies as introductory course it was fine but id didnt contain practical assignments as following in specialization courses do the structure of the course was ok	3
informative but needs more challenging assignments	2
very helpful for people who are new to the field however i do wish many of the concepts were explained more clearly often new concepts are introduced and no clear definition is given	2
you cannot submit your quizzes nor your program assignment unless youre a paying memberthis is the first time i ran into such a class in courserasadplease allow nonpaying people who want to learn to participate in quizzes and peer graded assignments like other institutions are doing	2
lecture too focus on the theory that not very useful on business world the bi tool microstrategy used in the homework is too slow and crash from time to time	0
great course for learning python its adapted for everyone both those with experience in computing and those without computing experience	4
i love the teaching style very explanatory and easy to comprehend	4
course is not good at all the instructor assumes that you have a good genomic background	0
i think this is a great course for understanding the basics in programming	3
a good orientation class to level set key terms and concepts	3
at this point i am excited and completely satisfied 	4
i did like the course but when you make the exercises and post something on the forums omg huge mistake you start getting replies of everything so you can have  emails a day because other people are doing their exercises and posting on the forum the worst is that is no way to turn off those	2
thank you for this course	4
this course was quick and simple i enjoyed the definitions and monetary examples i would have more quizzes and harder questions	2
great coursepractical  enjoyable 	4
wow chuck really good job and it was really nice to learn in this way now up to course 	4
i base my ratings of courses on  things is the material clear yes for the most part though the lecturer sometimes gets mixed up and uses terms like class  object the wrong way can i generalize from the material to other applications this module spends a lot of time on c before you get to objectivec specific material so you dont get much objectivec theres a bit of a tour of xcode but its not particularly comprehensive the apps you build are incredibly basic and theres no real discussion of how to generalize from them is the course presented in an engaging way this course is super boring if you already know c a lot of the content is a waste of time but i imagine that if you dont know c this is not a good way to pick it upso overall one other thing  the assignments are graded in a pretty bizarre way you have to take a screencap video of your code and your app in action upload the video and then wait for another person to enroll in the course and review your submission in return you have to review three other peoples videos sort of a rolling homework ponzi scheme this strikes me as a system that could be greatly improved upon	1
this course is to the point the lessons are designed so that they can be accessible and theyre broken down into smaller pieces so that theyre not too much  the exercises are interesting since you have to keep in mind what you want to do with journalism yourself they help you to organize this idea you might have in your mind or think about it	3
so far its good and simple this course is for those who really want to make practical impact in their lives so far so good	2
only directed to business situations probably great for managers some of the ideas im sure could work in personal situations as well but hard to know exactly how or which ones	3
this course covers challenging technical topics and i appreciate that the effort that went into making it that said i have serious concerns about the quality of execution for part ii of the course which was much inferior to part i of the coursein general the lectures themselves were up to the quality of part i and are well done in many cases the practice quizzes were less helpful including one sequence where each quiz extended the previous one but if you there was no way to learn from your errors especially an error in the first quizfor the peer graded assignments there was one answer field for multiple questions rather than one per question worse the answers often required equations and latex math was not available the only solution was to put the answers in a document on a cloud drive like google drive and paste a link in finally for the peer review you could just mark questions correct or wrong with no way to provide private feedback on what was lacking in a response furthermore doing the peer review was purely optional and the results were not actually scored part  was similar but it was possible to upload the document to coursera directly and peer review was a required part of the course resulting in a grade either there are serious limitations with this iteration of the coursera platform or the course authors did not understand how to properly implement thisfinally in the session i took their was no active teaching assistance presence there were no responses to student questions nor concerns that were raised about typos and possible errors in the quizzes and problem assignments either the course should not have been offered if no ta support was available or there should have been some notification in syllabus that this session would only have peer assistance with no support from the course staff	1
assignments should be much more clear in terms of what is expected from the students and how to approach the problem	1
great	3
a paradox that a course about virtual instruction is the worst course ive done on coursera i am on a verge of quitting it  despite lots of good information there is no effort to present it in an interesting and engaging way  virtual educators say that the students should interact with the platform every  minutes and yet they give you  min video to listen to and look at the same picture  no forums available but the notice about forums interrupts all the videos	0
great	4
it was very useful course specially that content about construction technology trends and the guys delivered it very simple and covered almost most of construction management topics cant wait to the next course from columbia university	3
great overall materiali think work needs to be done in order to improve the presentation of new concepts and vocabulary as well as the english of the speaker and the corresponding caption	2
the video is too long	0
the instructor needs improvement on her presentation skills she is just reading off the slides instead of providing more examples and scenarios to help student comprehend the material i have to retake almost every quiz under her courses in previous courses i passed quizzes in one try please improve material or get a better instructor	1
in general this course is very nice and informative but the recipes should mention cooking time also i find it a bit scary that the author doesnt make her own chicken broth a processed one	3
somewhat dissapointed that only the built in datastructures were discussed and done so with too much time	2
this is the best course so far teacher is amazing you have to spend some time on this course but at the end of the day it is worth it	4
an ok introduction to swift programming but i can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course also lecturers were virtually nonexistent on the forums to help with questions which is disappointing since it is a paid course which implies you are paying for their time and effort not just the certificatebest advice for people taking this course is to get through the material as early as possible and give yourself as much time as possible to work on the project dont wait till the last week to work on itwould also suggest the following changes to improve the course and help people understand the material better have a programming exercise to complete at the end of every week to prove you have understood the material taught a quiz alone with  or less questions is not enough the course ramps up way to quickly with the project if all you have been doing is following the videos students should be practicing and proving they know the work far more often provide a clearer project brief since it was clear many people did not understand all the requirements provide a video of what the final project should do in general to make it even cleareroverall i didnt have a bad experience with the course just disappointed that it was really bear bones there were too few opportunities to prove your understanding it was poorly managed and the lack of interaction from the lecturers a massive problem when they are being paid to help out not just provide videos and forget about the students	2
lectures and material were really good havent done the practical part so cant say anything about it	3
very good balance of concept and practice would be  stars if all tools are open source	3
too slow	0
very theoretical and unstructured	1
i love every thing about gis  coursera	4
simple understandable very thank you for ur lectures	3
i really enjoyed this course and i will use this knowledge in my personal interests of the ecology of food and waterborne infectious disease	4
all the material was relevant to algorithms and the advance problem were very challenginga must do course for those who are interested in algorithms designthank you coursera and its team	4
it seems too easy	3
unfortunetly i can only give a  there were more things that i didnt like and think that should be improvedwhat i liked positive to see illinois keep presenting specializations on coursera the material was ok with clean presentation style the case studies is a very positive resource to have in the course to think criticallywhat i didnt like the course is excessivelly short with only  minutes of videos per module previous courses in both specialization  digital marketing and improving videos have at least  to  hours of video materials a huge gap also if i benchmark against the top specializations from wharton and u michigan business foundations business analytics leading people and teams and finance valuation and investing all of them pack a  to  hours of video lectures there is a huge gap also i didnt found the quizzes challeging in a digital world content is king  both in quality and quantity you have quality but are missing the quantity unfortunetly i see a trend  the other course of the managerial economics specialization also is very short a minor thing that i also didnt like was the form that the slides were presented as in previous specializations  in my opinion all of the module slides should be in the readings section in only one document instead of divided in small pieces per video lecturei hope that yu accept my critic as constructive because i have liked most of illinois courses and was very impressed by the quality and extensive set of videos in the improving business speciaization	2
excelllent course i have completed my first week modules	3
this is my first course in courseraconsinformation redundancy unnecessary required readingextend some information that only need few hours to study to a  weeks coursesprosthere are some useful basic concepts  frames	0
too high level last assignment too ambiguous peer assessment was completely random and not reliable to pass the course	1
the course is ok but the assignment require a lot of prior knowledge on automation control theory which can be really difficult to be donei suggest that they should provide extra material for those students who have only computer science background	2
super basic nothing to be learnt there no need to purchase the course just go over the videos if youre new to digital	1
it was a thrilling experience to complete epidemiology the basic science of public health offered by coursera i am now excited to obtain the certificate as i have paid by net banking an amoumt of required inr  also submitted my photo idi want to know how long it will take to issue this certificatethanks  regardsdrbalbir sdewan	4
im giving this course one star because zero stars is not an optioni wish i had read course reviews prior to beginning first assignment was tough but doable second assignment seems straight forward but the template they ask that you follow contains small tricks which appear to be far beyond anything touched on in lecturesim actually going to fight for my money back what a scam	0
very good content and the teacher seems very comfortable with it	4
very interesting course	4
the homework and the lectures are at totally different level	1
excellent course to focus on how to get the most from your studies i	4
this courses touches many interesing aspects about r programming but i did not like the structure  it does not seem to me that it adequates its difficulty coming from the r programming enviornmentalso i miss some swirl lessons for many of the readings from the book there are not too many help from the mentors and the peer assigment in week  took me too much time and had to consult a lot of external resources readings in general are ok but too simplei have learnt many things but	1
hated the course and the content i truly regret investing my money on this course	0
it was a pain installing the necessary tools for this course for me on linux made it a little difficult to keep up	2
this course was very useful there was something that i already knew but some thing were new for me	4
all lecture no use of media	0
far too easy and too expensive i did this seven week course in about  hours i can get much more thorough instruction from code academy for free or low cost	1
quite basic but good to set the needed programs	2
very understandable and well explained	4
very superficial teachings this course seems aimed at non legal students considering the very rare references to the legal instruments articles for the price paid i could have found most information on wikipedia furthermore the staff isnt responding at all to the manyrequests of the students regarding errors in the questionaries deadline explanations etc even worse the subtitles to the videos are full of small typos and wrong transcriptions sometimes changing the meaning of a sentence thereby confusing the audience	1
bad material poor graphics wrong mc questions in videosmore hype content than a coursethis is not the way to learn python seriously dont take this one	0
i believe programming need practice i would prefer to have many many assignments like  on each week at least thats the best way to remember and get speed on simple things	2
absolutely great coursethis course has demystified the basics of accessing webdata and has atleast helped me realize the power of python to access itfaculty well delivered  you have kept the discussions lively and have made me eager to learn more	4
very good course over all if you know a bit about linear algebra the course can get a little borring some times	3
so much disjointed information i felt absolutely crushed trying to learn and understand all this am waiting for another  hours before i can reattempt the quizpersonally i feel that this course assumes the student is automatically an expert in statistics simply due to completing the first intro to statistics course the logical progression of how to approach different problems  and the terminology of the statements involved has been thrown out the windowif youre new to statistics i suggest you should at least double the time allocation they provided	1
easy to learn 	4
the course is fine but i would give the certificate out for free and charge for the ones that follow in the specialization as an incentive to enroll	2
excellent content undermined by technical problems the nonmultiplechoice assignment which involves analyzing a business plan is particularly annoying it requires uploading of screenshots but there is no upload feature is available the assignment must be graded by peers  which means if you happen to take this course at a time when no one else is taking it youre out of luckre content i would discourage you from taking this course if you dont speak fluent french indeed you even need to understand how the french sometimes mistranslate into english because some words in the answers to the multiplechoice quizzes dont exist in any english dictionary  you will only understand them if you can guess what french term inspired the bad translation the pace of lecturehallstyle discourse in the videos is such that subtitles will not save you if you dont understand frenchthese technical and minor content issues are unfortunate because the core content i s really quite good	2
frustrating as hell too much math and computer coding	0
i founded so basic i didnt feel engaged to continued	1
the questions in the weekend quizzes are not that challenging and the lectures are also not concentrated on complicated real life scenarios good for an introductory course	3
animations animations and animations	0
shouldnt be presented as a course that is also suitable for english speakers it is not the english subtitles are completely incomprehensible	0
a good course with valuable insights however id like to see more assignments	2
excellent course for any social and political activist of any country	4
its a wonderful course to take a complete paradigm shift in the thought process	4
its fine to charge for certificate but submit the quiz is also locked if u try to learn for free i do think that is a violation to the learning process	3
the case study approach is a great ideabut i wish the instructors were more candid about the tools that were in use it seems dodgy that the instructor is a ceo of a commercial tool vendor and is encouraging students to use itthe quizzes in the course were extremely shallow	1
course really introduced me to the basic concepts that i need in database design i really appreciate	3
this course need michael manino	3
even though the course discusses relevant topics the level is extremely low the lab sessions were easily solved applying copypaste code from the provided notebooks with minor adaptions moreover  questions in the lab sessions were not related to machine learning at all but simply looping over data and counting or similar the intro video and course introduction strongly suggested using deep learning in the course did not happen we trained kmeans on precomputed features which happened to come from from a deep learning network not sure which one inception i didnt even watch the lectures here from disappointment that is not deep learning it just shows you how well deep learning can workgraphlab is a mature framework i guess but its commercial and scikitlearn is better imho and freeif you wish to learn machine learning take the stanford course on machine learning for andrew ng this course is in matlab not ideal for machine learning but adequate for a better understanding of intelligent system implementationsmaybe the course is ok if youre a beginner in machine learning but not good	1
instructor advice is primarily to use stack overflow	1
