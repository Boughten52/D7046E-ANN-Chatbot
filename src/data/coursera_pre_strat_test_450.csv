for a beginner like me its totally going over the head i mean i get the logic but if you guys can please give more codei am learning data structures for the first time and it is bit difficult for me to grasp it all and write codes in a week	2
the worst course ive ever takenbad sound quality dead discussion forums not possible to understand material without external not mentioned in the course sources	0
recommend this course as a good introduction user stories is most valuable part	3
very good course i enjoyed it very much and appreciated the educated and polite style of prof jeffrey sachs i would have appreciated a copy of the figures and grafique shown the course release in  would need to be updated the quizz need a real involvement of the student to be completed challenging but i personnaly appreaciated very much the quizz would need some profound revision since some links are not available anymore and some answer are simply wrong a statement from the columbia university  prof j sachs would have been welcome since completing the  week course imply a real involvement from the student overall very appreciated course thank prof sachs	2
mostly a bunch of unsubstantiated and dogmatic cliches flaunted around the agile buzzword in its best and most religious form	0
the lecturer was an annoying speaker and very repetitive i just couldnt listen to him im sorry there was also so much about human development etc that i started to wonder when the info about dogs would starti found the formatting so different from other courses ive taken that it was hard to get started and figure things out adding to that was the constant interruption of the paid certificate page if i answer no once please leave me alone i also think its a bit suspect for a prof to be plugging his own book for one of these courses	0
simple and understanding	4
quite a hard coursebut laid great foundations and reduced the dependence on graphlabthanks emily	3
why there is no minus one star because one star is way to much for this course stay away	0
poorly made very short videos that do not explain the subject matter some of the content is outdated	1
excellent course very well explained by andrew ng  many many thanks to andrew ng and all the other that contributed to that course 	4
great course a lot of hard work though	3
very difficult test programs	2
just following a text book without an added value from the lectures	0
happy from the coursera	4
tough course to get through and very different to the others in the specialisation but knowing about statistics has given me a different view of the world and i have really gained something from doing it i can hold reasonable conversations with data analysts and the like now	3
very caotic	1
course material was pretty good but the lectures were hard to watch lots of editing problems and blurring on the text gave me a headache several times would rate higher if the videos were improved	1
great class i totally en	3
it said it was subtitled into english but thats only the first video	0
it has almost no content and isnt actually useful ive heard later classes in the series are way tougher so the ramp up isnt at all good	0
the course is very well presented great experience for those individuals who believe in purity and virtue of the ideas enchained by the mathematical consensus	4
c	3
would have greatly preferred if open source tools were used	0
didnt really elevate my writing mostly due to the fact that there were no practical exercises included though some of the theoretical stuff that is covered is sort of common sense most is still very relevant so i dont regret taking the course	2
to course got tougher every week while the lecture video is not cover everything	1
this is a well designed course that is clear in what it focuses on to give you a good foundation that said there is so much more to learnmake sure you look at the final project after each module to get an idea for all the opportunities to apply the optional materials you can still pass without doing using the concepts in the optional sections but there is time to get even more out of the final project if you prepare and explore	3
not very good audio	0
 the title is misleading since at scale led people to think that large scale data processing platform such as spark and nosql databases will be central to the course right from the start the assignments need a lot of improvements i am not happy with how were often only required to submit a single number as an answer the biggest problem is that this way the grader wont be able to give you meaningful feedback  hint of where you might be wrong a grader that only tells you your answer is incorrect does little to help you learn from mistakes i think assignment  can be paced differently  now it feels that we have a bunch of very easy parts ag that is not very interesting where the last three are significantly harder	1
this course in okay but if you want to know much more about html you should take class on fullstack web development by the hong kong university of science and technology which i liked more than this that course is wonderful and interesting too	2
the contect of some modules of this course is very light and the multichoice tests at the end insultingly easy i would not pay for the certificate unless you need one per sei found that modules  and the communications part of module  were useful however the most valuable thing i got from the course was the link to the lecture by mike sanders on advanced multitaskingthe reference material referred to is very light  there are no reading lists and one link is to an outofdate web page coursera may wish to review whether it continues offering this course	1
morely designed on slideshows not effective	1
i feel this courses needs to be split into two different streams one for beginners and one for people who are more comfortable with coding and r i think that the learning curve is too steep for a part time course	2
the professor just read the slides and most of the slide and content are repetitive the content of the entire course can be studied in less than  hour so did the other courses of this specialization its not a good course and i think its not worth to purchase these classes	0
good but needs more assistance with the students	2
not too difficult but learned a decent amount	3
needs to cover a bit more	2
not enough practical examples the information is providede on a bit higher level	2
a very good introduction to this specialization with fun and thoughtprovoking exercisees	3
very complete thank you	4
very good introductory course to new learners in bioinformatics or students who are just curious about this field	3
i really liked this course it made me understand a lot about teaching and it was really helpful for me as an english teacher thank you to the professors	4
really nice lecture ive learned a lot from this wonderful course	4
sense of humour is offputting tone is unnecessarily childish python is yelling at you key ideas are unmotivated just trust me functions are useful includes line of code impossible to understand in earlier videos eg loops appear in earlier weeks office hours just seem like professor showing off all the places he goes to i enjoyed the interviews with people discussing their work or history	1
i think the course is great as a practical guide to study with a flare of science you wont be overwhelmed with scientific terms and results but the advices will always be nicely explained and based on research you can later look into deeper on your own i was cautious about this course but now after completing it i highly recommend it	4
way too many peer reviewed assignments	1
informative and motivating especially to the young and passionate environmental engineers	3
good delivery of the course	3
probably a good course if you arent terribly familiar with git or some form of version control it also helps to get all the tools in place to be ready for the other courses	2
although the course content is highly informative and interesting the way its all presented it not the best most of the time concepts are confusing because of this quizzes become guessing games most of the time forums feel neglected by the course tutor lots of question that someone knowledgeable should answer become random rambling as nobody is sure as to what the tutor actually meant as somebody said on the forums i feel like im alpha testing your course	2
poor lectures inaccurate and incomplete information narrative about changing colors is reminiscent of sal khan i just cant listen to any more of this	0
i like the idea of using javascript for learning very basic idea of programming it was very easy to follow and transitions well into the next course	4
was helpful in laying the foundations of my programming skills	3
the course is out of touch with reality and systematically underplays the paris agreement progress of renewable energy and eu emissions mitigation says absolutely nothing about climate science at times the attitude is down right hostile and disgusting will share these observations widely we are in a climate emergency and need to do everything we can when i was taking this course my city is going through severe flooding and the country is in yellow alert stage due to abnormal thunder storms you should be ashamed of yourself for pushing this garbage	0
excellent course for beginner in the world of big data some issues with the handson lab maybe due to a change in cloudera softs provided examples were not working asis for me because of some path issues but great anyway	3
this course needs an easier way to peer review downloading individual files to computer and plugging into your project without overwriting your own work is a nuisance especially during assignment  where everything needed to be hosted in the server in order to work this made is extremely difficult to review	1
it was amazing experience	4
thank youthis course was very effective for meit has a lot of details and i need to review some issues agian	3
very confusing course unclear example too theoretical very limited relevancy to business questionsalso presentation format could be improved tables are not intuitive to readunderstand	0
this will be an excellent course for undergrads and high school students but not much in depth knowledge and learning strategy for higher levels of educationteachers show mastery on their subject matter  though their presentation style is not genuine and naturally animated to the point that it may feel boring	1
it is very nice course and improve my english writting style	2
personally i feel that the way of sharing and teaching was assuming everyone is an expert in this subject this course need to be reviewed to make it more suitable to various groups of profession as not everyone has the same level of mathematics background	0
a good glance on the technologies in this current trend good to keep ourselves updated and learned	4
a little devoid of depth	0
interesting content but issues with broken links needed to complete quizzes while they were due needs better explanation of how to use other resources many of the quiz questions are arbitrary rather than really testing knowledge gained in the class the lectures are still useful and would recommend doing this as a free course but see no use in paying for a certificate on completion of the course	1
way too slow and too long  too many digressions byside remarks lessons of life etc  go straight to the point	0
a nice entry level course lacking a forum discussion was not even able to report some issue with videos and no explanation provided with quizzes results 	1
this course was more diverse than i thought it would be and i really enjoyed it however i thought the end of year project could have provided more differentiated prep material as that confused me	2
i am having a very difficult time finishing this course i find the topic dull and the content uninteresting it is the first course of the cybersecurity specialization  i hope the other courses are not like thisi rated it one star for a couple of reasons i have been in software for many years and i know about software design i would not have expected to have a weeks long course on software design and usability when my desire is to learn about software security i understand its importance but this course should be part of a ui design course not in a technical cybersecurity specialization imo  the course is all about theory not about practical matters lets admit it  todays security software is not for the uninformedexperienced given this again i feel this course would be better served in another specialization about ui design or for software design bestpracticesthat is my  i am moving onto other courses before finishing the usability security i am aware that i will have to complete this course to get my certification this alone will discourage me from purchasing a specialization in the future	0
well presented contentit was a little bit weird for me to jump straight to jquery and spending so little time on javascript but it works out for the course i would suggest a couple of more examples and explanation of general programming concepts with providing relevant pdfgenerally a very good and contentrich course	3
 for knitr otherwise its waste of time	0
very well made course the lecture are fun and not boring at allits a very good introduction and the main takeaway is that youll learn why and how to negotiate fairfor a beginner in negotiation this course lays a very good foundation and opens the eyes broadens the view on what negociation really is meant to be	4
from the course i learned very simple but powerful learning techniquesdr oakley dr sejnowski thank you for this great course	4
you can take the assignments only if you pay	1
quiz isnt challenging enough to validate the understanding of the user taking the course 	2
a very friendly way to jumpstart your css knowledge with lengthy explanations that are easy to understand for beginners	4
i am very frustrated by the disconnect between the lectures and programming assignment in this course the lectures are very basic but that makes sense for an introtype course the programming assignments however have very little connection to the lectures i have some experience using software with commandbased interface including r for statistical analysis and i am relatively good at searching and finding information independently but this course was way too hard even for me i might revisit programming assignments again once i have more time and more experience with the application just for the sake of completing the course but i kind of find it silly that i need experience with r to pass the course intended for people with little to no experience with r	1
the course information is very interesting but covers the material too briefly the topics were covered very quickly and not in very much depth quizzes often asked questions in a way that was not covered in the course material and were therefore quite difficult to figure out at times im taking this course series to learn the material not to be tricked of failed on a quiz also as this is a rather mathintensive subject a more comprehensive review of the algebraic tools and skills required would be helpful lastly there were many mistakes with grammar and spelling in the written portions i know english isnt everyones first language but if we are paying for these educational materials then it doesnt look very professional for there to be glaring errors repeatedly throughout the material its not that difficult to have a native speaker proofread before publishing i would be happy to do this for you any job openings just some thoughts	1
a very interesting course good explanations excellent readings and great study cases	4
maybe the instructor could illustrate more	3
great information from the lectures and great photos of the arctic the free downloadable book is an extra bonus and helps with the quiz questions well done terry and team	4
the topics sometimes are very superficial containing little information but at all the course is good	3
i would appreciate more practical cases with the detailed methodology that were applied also i will love external resources to study and examples of design thinking applied in different types of industries	2
good brief introduction expecting more details	3
this course is very inconsistent when it comes to javascript instead of giving fundamentals of the language course instructors prefer to give you a bunch of nonstandard libraries and teach you a couple of randomly selected methods which could be applied to images all core concepts such as data types data structures are explained very sketchy oop paradigm isnt explained at all for example they give you a line of code which goes something likevar x  new simpleimageno explanation of what simpleimage is is given neither you are taught how exactly it works apparently this course relies heavily on selflearning the lib docs given on their siteall together this leads you to simply monkeycoping lecture materials into code editor without even realising how it works and what it does this course is at best serve observatory purpose to give student just a peek at what web development is likethis course could not be used as a solid foundation fow specialization	0
good introduction to pandas interesting information but not that information dense compared to other courses musical intros and outros on videos waste too much time too many ums and ahs later assignments can be hard to get exactly right due to bugs in qstk and also uncertainty around event counts would have liked to be able to discuss workinprogress code more but understand that its tough to manage cheating in an online course	2
it was so much fun to complete this course and i really learned a lot	4
awesome class	4
i think there there is too much time given to the esoteric of what makes plots pretty rather than the nuts and bolts of how to do it and the limitations of using pandas and matplotlib for real world data	1
a jurassic park image with material you can read by yourself	0
this class was a good overview of the topic of project management with an entertaining and well spoken teacher this videos and content were engaging but not over whelming	3
very good and in portuguese	4
superficial treatment of the subject matter presentation was awkward and slow and at times condescending in tone this whole course is equivalent to a  hour seminar on how to live more positively presented at local community centre it is not university level learning  instead it seems glib and lacking in substance	0
course material was quite informative	3
so far its a very good course i always wanted to learn about cancer as it took two lives from my family i would give it a five star if the professors could explain more elaborately as i have very little experience in this field thanks a lot	3
so basically it cuts off its like it gives you part of the information and then drops off they also speed through it much like my old math teacher in college whcih caused  of the class to drop now im in them mist of it paid for blue host paid for my web name and it looks like im going to have to pay someone to finish it so bascially what i got was a bunch of added on expenses and still no web site i would not recommend this course	1
what makes this course useful are the exercises so unless you are paying dont bother and its not really worth paying for as its just a synopsis of stuff you easily find on youtube	0
teaching behaviourism in  is scandalous	0
no consistency from very easy web design fundamentals to advanced javascript with no explanation videos to help over a series of quizzes and assignments in week  lesson 	1
thanq sir for offering this course at free cost this will help in my future development for improving my skills and talent	4
th week final assignment has bugs	3
the course is very well done it provides an overview on the most used machine learning techniquesspecial thanks to the professor andrew ng for a very clear explanation during the class	4
simply amazing to refresh my th standard and masters concepts of calculus pratically	4
course is gathering general information on smartphones and tells an historical view of smartphones et os associatedwhat could help professionnally is more about how to develop apps on these phones today and tomorrow	1
this is an amazing journey that will definitely be very helpful to your future awesome course 	4
enjoyed the course so much planning to do it again later this year	3
this course is the first course in the coursers java programming specialization however it uses javascript to teach high level programming concepts if you want to learn javascript this course is not for you if you want to learn java this course is not for youthe course mainly solves image manipulation problems with dukes proprietary javascript ide all the details are black boxed so you cant see whats in the javascript functions i believe this is the wrong way to teach newbies because too much abstraction is never goodalso as a man i was personally offended by professor susan rodger saying she wanted to see more women in programming more woman means less men and that is sexist as a supporter of equal opportunity duke university should take disciplinary action against professor rodger i will not financially support any university that allows its faculty to express inappropriate personal ideology in a classroom settingi do not recommend this course or any course with professor susan rodger	1
excellent course it is applicable in many areas as our modern world is adding up complexity about everywhere and everyday in our lives the course provides excellent perspectives of thinking and good exercisedecision	3
very informative and educational case studies was relevant	3
learn some useful stuff	4
this course wasnt well suited to me being a person with a programming background it was too introductory but that doesnt say anything against the course the reason i dont rate the course highly is that it just wasnt that coherent i would have preferred to have a single consistently good instructor	1
we spent several months waiting for this capstone to appear the instructors dissapeared and nobody knew if this one was going finally to happen or what	0
very interesting	4
i found that some parts of the course were confusing you really have to take the time to read documentation to do the assignments which was difficult with my busy schedule and just because you read the documentation doesnt mean that you understand the code overall i learned a lot and still recommend the course  just wish there was less background and more explanation of the actual codes that you can use while parsing	3
i am just not feeling this course i have done up to week five and still am not hooked sorry	0
very useful course 	4
ver y informative hands on and extremely simple to follow	4
no forum what are you thinking	0
the contents of the course are definitely insightful and approrpriately based on scientific research dr greg urban is extremely knowleadgeable on the topicthe reason why i am not giving the course a higher rate is because  i find the pace of the course is quite slow  the inactivity in the discussion forums and the lack of peer reviews in the assignments reduces its interactivity and  both the contents and grading system are very theoreticalstill i would recommend this course as it provides a solid foundation on the principles behind the dynamics of culture	2
the exercises are confusing	2
not particularly engaging some significant overlaps in content on the videos some rambling videos that could really do with editing i liked that the content within the main lecture was concise  it really needed to be because the lecturer has very little variety to his tone of speech  listening requires high cognitive load dont want to be too down on it because i really appreciate the free content and the subject material is very interesting but it could do with a bit more love and the practical application of the marketing concepts described in the course maybe start with some eyetracking on someone completing the course	1
this was a fantastic journey learned new things reinforced old skills engaged with many other talented amateurs	4
turned out to be a course in financials rather than modeling the whole specialization could have been designed to make better progress in modeling	1
the instructors did nothing they did not even respond to a single question through the entirety of the course the information in the readings was helpful though	2
this is a pretty good course for learning basic html css and javascript i already had some experience with these three languages so consider that when reading this review i found that the amount of information they cram into this three week course was pretty substantial which i think is a positive aspect of the course they dont just teach you what you need to complete the exercises they teach you a lot of things that even more experienced users of this language may have forgotten that being said i dont think the amount of information covered is realistically anyone could retain in three weeks i would instead see this course as a crash course as to what features are available with these three languages then save the course slides as sort of a reference for when you go off on your own my favorite part of this course is that the exercises are unique and fun the html assignment is sort of boring but thats because html is boring but the exercises that use javascript are a lot of fun to conclude i think this course would be great for brand new web developers and also for people who just need a refresher good luck	3
if youve completed the first course in this specialization then this is a repeat of a lot of the same information i didnt find the teaching style very effective either though it may work better for others	2
great	4
loving this course not only is it helping me learn the fundamentals of graphic design in a fun and inventive way but is also providing a great community would highly recommend this for anyone looking to improve or start there graphic design skills 	4
deari am very thankful to coursera to create this wonderful door towards achieving specialization with this course i not only got knowledge but also a confidencefashion is passion for me i wanted to do this course from a long time but for many reasons i could not afford it with coursera i got my dream come truei am and will be always grateful to the creators of this wonderful platformnow my only concern is how i can get onto this boat of fashion and luxury businessevening a small opening is enough to open the doors in this businessthank youregardsjunaid ahmed	4
using mooc  i was really hoping we would go more in depth on free tools like google analytics i would have liked information on how to better utilize the information i get from twitter pinterest and facebooks built in analytics tools as well i know im underutilizing them at present and theres good stuff therein spite of claims to the contrary the lexalytics and ibm bluemix videos did feel like extended infomercials moreover i work for a small nonprofit and we have neither the funds or bandwidth to utilize programs like this i think the time could have been better used doing a deeper dive with klout and socialmention im working on the assignment now and feel like we barely scraped the surface with both of these programsthere are just too many tools being introduced in this mooc and not enough practical learning tools are fantastic but its important to be utilizing them properly otherwise i end up feeling like im wasting time	1
great course	3
could have made it more interesting	2
a very basic course suited for those who are getting started on physical activity	2
this course is very good and informative	3
the assignment is meaningless lack of instructions	0
fascinating material but accent of the lecturer was sometimes difficult to understand the peer reviewed essays were good topics but in one case definitely should have attached to the following week the multiple choice tests however seemed to focus on trivia flawed but still a really interesting course	2
there is alot of advertisement for ubs in this course	1
the course cost too much for the gain of knowledge feels like this course could be merge with the first or the third course	0
great course i enjoyed a lot from the journey of western classical music from medieval till contemporary the teaching style of dr wright is engaging and accessible for beginners i will come back to the lectures and the youtube lists of full pieces of music even after the completion of the course this course further develops my interests in music and i started playing keyboard synthesizer during the course and am learning music theory the only thing that maybe could improve is the quizzes currently all the quizzes are multiple choice questions mainly on musical terminology it would be even greater to have more listening exercises and different kind of assignment like peer reviewed writing	3
nice idea but too many technical difficulties i tried to complete quiz  nine times and eventually passed the deadline and in order to submit my final assignment i had to embedded my images into a word doc and export it as a pdf i wont get extra marks for being able to work that out  i did enjoy the rest of the course though thanks for all your efforts	1
the excercises should be set up to be more comfortable	1
my advice for everyone is to take this course because i find it really useful	3
it is a good course that gives you a general idea about how to manage your time	2
very elaborate explanations in a way you feel you can do it dr chuck really is a great teacher also the clips about the history of computing are very worthwhile and just shows how far we have come and better  how far we can get	4
poor alignment between assignments and lectures lots of content poorly explained	0
i love your teaching style	4
really good end for a very good classyou will work more for this class its a capstone and it will be less theoretical and more practicalits an awesome class and it will deliver the tools that you need to improve yourself and be genuine generous and generative 	4
too basic for programers	0
the course feels too rushedcondensed for someone with no real scriptingcoding background i honestly felt this course wasnt for me because i wasnt learning enough	2
would have liked to do the assignments if they werent all locked by payment requirements	0
this course is way too slow and boring i am disappointed i have paid so much for so few content here why a full specialisation cycle when one or two courses would probably have been more than enough  too much distraction as well with funny videos that i had to pay for	0
i feel very satisfied with the learned topics the videos are clearly and easy to understand and follow	3
excellent course very very very recommended	4
this course does not say anything about digitization which is the core subject of the digital wave	1
the final assignment is impossible to finish since i have  version in my computer you as the course provider should modify the assignment instead of asking the student to make changes the point is that we are trying to gain some knowledge not wasting time on solving those bugs	0
the videos and lectures were fine but there seemed to be a lot missing from this course the discussion boards were empty and the reliance on peer reviewed papers left a little to be desired there could have been more instruction given on how to grade	1
only average much is said little information delivered	2
the final assignment is peer graded which means youll have to deal with idiots grading your final assignment	1
very insightful	2
good but need more practise problems in order to understand what you are learning	2
contrary to what is being billed here all the concepts here are from the more traditional school of marketing the way the ps are explained and applied through barely related to consumer products that are retailed digital marketing has barely made a dent in their revenuestechnology products dont follow this modelanother annoying aspect of this course is that things are not well defined so they cant be applied customer cocreation is presented as a ground breaking idea but it is defined so vaguely the definition states that customer cocreation is any contribution by a customer or otherwise that helps shape the products what is considered contribution is product feedback contribution if so this idea is as old as a bazaar or does the customer actually have to do creative work in the case of threadlessthe big problem with this course is that it does not introduce the student to any new mental frameworks leave alone anything practical this course is a prime example of academiaitis  ideas created in ivory towers without any practical input or use	0
it looks like a youtube review and not a real course	0
not enough information is provided to pass some of the quizzes without extensive additional research into organic chemistry or other topics there is no help forum or feedback from instructors	1
this courses content is useful but honestly the final project is ridiculous because it is peer reviewed and the project is not very straightforward everyone gets different answers and without an answer key no one knows what is right and wrong making it is almost impossible to pass this needs to change	0
matthew is a great instructor loved the way how he taught the entire series especially this one step by step explaining every little detail keep up the good work	4
very simplistic concepts and tactics which are already known to most of us who have been working for a while it might be useful for somebody who is just starting to work	0
i enjoyed and benefitted from some of this course in particular i would highly recommend the meditation labs the science of meditation videos and the short presentations from the tibetan buddhist monks  but i think the creators of this course need to be a lot clearer about what their aims are in that part of the course which dr germano presented since this was he was presenting the main overview of buddhist content it was particularly disappointing that his presentations were so badi understand that there were difficulties in getting the course up and running from the various delays in its starting date and the change to its title and perhaps dr germanos role was more affected than the other lecturers however its pretty damning when he manages to to be so offputting to so many of the students going on the discussion comments for my own part ive studied and practiced buddhism for more than  years and i am left with little sense of what his aims were for his lecturesto be more specificdr germanos presentationhe read from what i presume were lecture notes but more likely he was reading from an academic paper the language was pretty turgidhe could have just provided a pdf of his paper  notes for us to download that would have been much more helpful as presumably it would have had some structure to it doing that would have enabled him to use his video time in a more creative waymoocs are wonderful audiovisual opportunities but he had no slides or illustrations at all the few text headers which appeared then disappeared in only a very few seconds and sometimes did not relate directly to what he was saying at that timedr germanos content the amended title was tibetan buddhist meditation this is a complex subject which encompasses many layers of meditation practice culled from historically earlier buddhist traditions can i suggest that any future version of this course includes the followinginclude a video which presents the main aspects of the historical development of buddhism there was some mention of this in germanos material but he did it from the tibetan point of view surely what a modern day presentation needs is a modern impartial historical analysis of the subject its not as if there arent plenty of academics and practitioners who are active in this fieldits confusing to describe tibetan lesser vehicle practices but then illustrate them with pali text sources modern mindfulness practice and modern brahma vihara practice all of which have emerged from the modern theravadin traditionits also perplexing to include information about many modern theravadin teachers sayadaw goenka in a course apparently not about themdont get me wrong i enjoyed the videos about sayadaw and the interview with sharon saltzberg but i am left in the dark about just what differences if any there are between them and tibetan meditationoverall i think this course was offered prematurely much of its content was enthralling inspiring and very useful practically however much of it was not	1
really basic spreadsheet knowledge not to be recommanded for anybody who is already familiar with excel	0
excellent course for a beginner or postbeginner as the fundamentals of pronunciation are dealt with slowly in the first half and then it races ahead with useful language and vocabulary for everyday contemporary situations like talking about hobbies using the internet etc etc stylistically the professor may seem dry and mechanical to some but i liked her no fluff she moves at quite a pace for falsebeginners would have bene nice to ave had access to the chinese vocabulary during the course not at the end looking forward to the next course	3
really nice but a little complex for people who just want to learn the basics this would be very helpful for current college students as the course includes optional readings that are very informative and helpful for a deeper understanding	2
the course is uneven at best with some modules providing insights and knowledge and others not so much the presentation in some of the modules is perhaps an example of how not to do it reading fro a script in a monotonous voice some of the material like the lengthy historical review of edinburghs vet school might be good advertising and interesting but does not fall under the scope of what it takes to be a vet good idea but with a few exceptions less than average execution	1
completely disppointing	0
hiits a useful course but its too basicthanks	2
there is not much information you would not know before taking the course i was expecting more tips and tricks how to change well known theory to practical life	1
this is a good refresher course but you will need much more practice afterwards	3
the homework is more harder than what i learned the errors in speaking made me uncomfortable	2
a free book to read would have been nice	2
i thoroughly enjoyed this course and find that it encouragingly sets some directions and of course raises my excitement for further study into some of the different fields of philosophy thank you	4
nice course it should be given on finical aid	4
forums were poorly organized and not well participated inthere was no forum topic for the honors assignmenthonors assignment appeared to require unix which was not stated in the course requirementshonors assignment was due too early in the term	1
great exploration of narrative would be nice to see more examples and techniques for turning narrative into gameplay	4
nice course developping a web app in r is not exactly mainstream but i learned a lot	3
the videos are long and not engaging enough rather than digital marketing concepts this was more an application of trends to traditional marketing concepts some of the topics are already outdated and some assignments were more applicable to those residing in the us or are not exactly feasible to do at this point	0
content was thin and none of it felt immediately actionable  felt like more of a hey isnt this cool series of videos rather than something that could be used by a professional	1
highly theoretical presentation on attributes of tcp vs udp packets and also about ipv vs ipv packetsa little more on advantagesdisadvantages of one over the other some background history on why and how it was developed response from device manufacturers and some opinions on future adoption would be great valueadded to the coursethanks professor chung	3
not as advertized and way too much peer rating stuffwe do all the work the instructor does little or nonetoo much peer raqting stuff which i despise and there seems to be no way to unenroll	0
i like and enjoy this subjects  and let me think and learn a lot from it 	4
great introduction to how to live a healthy life within the constraints of your daily work life	4
very poor courseshould be removed from coursera	0
there was not the same application of programming skills as in the previous courses also this course started too late after the other courses and i lost a lot of momentum in completing coursework	1
userfriendly learning experience	4
i learned a few things the videos were good the feedback from the student reviews was erratic there was some good thoughtful feedback and some was nonsense i took the free option i dont think id ever pay for a course where evaluations are conducted by people who understand the material no better than i dothis is the second course in this series that i completed i also finished the machine learning course i think im done with this specialization	1
easy and interesting but the content is a little bit thin	3
i think this course needs more emphasis on practical applications and less mathematical background	2
a good course to begin with chinese	3
the assignment is in the right level	4
if there hadnt been so many hiccups with the videos and quizzes i would recommend this course however i lost a great deal of time viewing incomplete videos and trying to complete quizzes covering material that was not addressed or only partially addressed in the videos then had to go back and review all the videos once they had been reuploaded it was a very frustrating experience i lost momentum and even motivation and as a result am now behind with the assignments and quizzes	1
teacher is boring just learned programming from kahn academy and the teacher was excited to teach this guy thoughput a little effort in	0
good coursebut way out of my depth too mathematical for my liking would have preferred more balance to this course none of us are going to calculate things to such an extent	1
i am no used to this educational system so i find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools i find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations even though this is more a practical course it will benefit from being a bit more rigorous  so at least people can make proofs on they ownother than that it is a great course very practical and to the point	2
too short and easy	1
speaking of beginner level it is good until you are learning css in it  but as java script starts this course becomes a headache  not because javascript is difficult but they made it difficult  instead of going with basics they teach you to manipulate images  which is not every ones interest field  they should improve their javascript course  other than that it is ok 	1
this is a complex course for people who dont know r studio while it is not very hard to learn r studio even for people who are not comfortable with coding it is very difficult when people get stuck i did not get the much needed support when my r studio installation failed or when installation of libraries failed with error messages the instructor was good course content is good but the lack of a suitable support representative for such complex subjects pulls down the reputation of this course please provide a good support personnel to at least help with online queries	1
good enough for students who know a little about english writing but it is a little too easy for international students who have already begun their study in america	3
this is a really weak and not very smart course compared to the other two in this specialisation strategy formulation  strategy implementation	0
horrible	0
really nice basic but just right	4
lack of examples	2
quite self sufficient easy to follow pace is fine but a little bit slow for someone with programming experience in other language	3
sweet and short course however if you dont have adobe ilustrator nor plan to buy the certification it is a little bit too short and basic	1
good entrance level course for beginner	4
really good course clear discussion of databases and how they are used	3
im not sure if the material presented in this course warranted a whole separate course even if it only was one week it probably could have been inserted in various segments of a larger data science specialization throughout the classes most of the topics discussed should be common knowledge to a midlevel manager of data science or even strategic marketing in general	1
good for people who dont have any background about coding and want to build a prototype of an app	2
good overview and introduction to main concepts	3
i enjoyed this class and learned a lot the intervening research topics did not seem to be part of the grading for this course and i am not sure if anyone did them after the first one the final peer assessment project just asked for a repeat of everything that had been said in the class since the final lecture went all the way up to obamacare there was no room to add anything to what the course had already said	3
an excellent introduction to machine learning it gives much confidence with handson learning the pace of the course is very good with required information being given to student with minimal confusion by a good teacher after this course a typical student would be well prepared to learn further for solving real life problems	3
the worse course ever	0
it absolutely amazing course  i personally benefit a lot really its not just the certificate thank you coursera for this huge chance	0
nothing helpful	0
it was very interesting and quite simple to followindicative for beginners	2
comprehensive cover of the basics	3
too hard in practice	0
the audio is very very poorthat makes it very hard to understand what prof kohler is trying to impart on usi often lost track	2
very interesting	3
this course is not free you must pay to access assignments and quizzesi am really annoyed with the direction coursera is moving in regard to premium content if they keep up this trend ill move to class central or other moocs	0
the lecturer is great the learning material is comprehensive everything is very good for python starters 	4
too fast paced not suited for absolute beginners first week takes alone about  weeks to complete and master	0
a very profound course with narrow specialization	4
i expected much more in this course in my point of view a very long time was spent to learn how to draw something in the screen i thought this course would be focused in object oriented programming and all about the best practices why not but it didnt sometimes was very hard to go on with this anyway thank you all	2
a good course especially if you are not too aware of autism	2
i was hoping for something a little more technical this course might be good for someone who has no previous knowledge of the nutrition content of food or how to cook it would be perfect for kids getting ready to head off to college whove never cooked for themselves	2
very good course for beginners i liked the lectures they were engaging and bonus videos are nice addition exercises were maybe too easy but still for a beginners course just right the only problem is there is less practical work than it should be adding more exercises would be nice and adding more difficult ones would help better grasp the material thats why only  stars	3
too much work in a week im working and i have finished some other courses which were a bit lighter although longer in time i would be mad if i try to finish this course on time its a bit disappointing	1
the best course i ever took	4
r is really just the worst and the instructors do not make it better the code in this class is unreadable too many one liners because its faster to write though harder for other people to read variables are named cryptic things like spins or x rather than names with meaning eg spraysbyinsect again because its faster to type way too many cases of there is more than one way to do it which just makes things confusing because the other ways tend not to be equivalentwhat im most concerned about is that ive seen lots of poorly written code in many different languages java c c python perl and now r but ive also seen really wellwritten code in all the languages but r i have yet to see any code in r that is flexible maintainable and clear which leads me to think that no such code exists or its so rare that it doesnt matter it is clear to me that if i am to do data analysis then i will need a different set of tools but because this specialization is taught entirely around r the lectures are about r not about higherlevel concepts then this specialization is not useful to me	0
this course is a good way to start anyone on learning more about how to help others in distress you dont need to be a trained clinician or mental health expert to learn about psychological first aid i think it would benefit communities tremendously if more people can learn about pfa	3
horrific if i could rate this zero i would the instructor will give you a one sentence explanation and definition for a term literally i downloaded the transcripts to help with my notes and assignments and then say now that we learned x and fly right into the next term worse many of the sentences dont even make sense and completely incoherrant even in the written transcript i am having to go out and find additional textbooks to research the basic definitions of what is required to pass the course there is even less explanation of realworld applications examples and demonstration it is almost as though she tried to memorize a sheet of definitions and repeated them without the use of her notes this results in a highly monotonous monologue with awkward gestures and little actual content i was planning on going for the pr for digital media certification but i cant handle another course like this its a waste of time and money	0
the course lacks of explanation and its very difficult to follow it seems that the instructor just reads the slides without reasoning and explanation suggested reading materials are needed	0
thanks a lot to coursera 	4
lectures are too long it lacks clinical correlationthe course focus only technical lab issues when you look for antimicrobial resistance course the last thing that you need is tech theory of course that some concepts are needed in order to provide fundamental basis but the main goal is and always will be how to interpret antibiograms and infere the most probable mechanism of resistance so there is a need for clinical correlation if its not present the course should be entitled laboratory methods for antimicrobial resistance	2
it feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors the programming assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience other than swirl it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before i worked hard to be able to follow it but if i knew how uninvolved the instructors were i would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it disappointing	1
just read the ppt	1
material is very basic for anyone with even the smallest amount of programming experience very slow pace	1
very basic even for people with no ds backgroundissues with quiz having passed and results showing as failed inability to speed up and move on to next module	1
most concepts are rather theoretical and it feels more like a probability and stats course there is not much focus on excel implementation and life is made seemingly easy with all the templates provided	3
i do appreciate the effort put into this course but as a programming course it is not very didacticit lacks structure and even the names of classes chosen for the examples seem odd	0
im really excited to complete this course and have a better understanding of graphic design	3
good introduction to the medical side of biofilm studies	3
short but complete course about project management i like	3
it is very short to feel like a real class video lectures are too short too i liked the readings	2
a good course the methods and pace was not good enough i wonder if those new to these topics learnt anything	1
p theories is applied in cross country cross industry analysis i think it is very innovative and easy to apply wish you could enjoy the course	3
i tried this course for a third time already during last  years and finally i got my first certificate of neuroscience i also watch  other courses on coursera and i think this one is the best start for these who decide to dive into neurosciencethanks to everyone who made this courser possible	4
a little bit of more information on the course couldnt hurt it	2
very informative quite difficult but very helpful and economically educative course	4
the material in this course is well presented though scarce at times however it has its share of problems little to no interaction from tas or mentors in the forumsthe quizzes are often out of sync with the lecturesthe final exam has severe problems with questions form not contentin more detail on the final exam some of the questions dont even contain all the content to answer them they can request multiple answers but have single question boxes andor the reverse	1
completely lost this is not meant for rank beginners data camps free r course has been much more helpful for me than this it doesnt have the same level of detail as this but at least im not watching an instructor gloss over concepts or ideas that are completely foreign to me as someone completely new to programming	0
this is by far the worse course id ever had taken if you are a beginner i suggest you go look somewhere else the software installation is hardly explained the instructor writes a whole bunch of code in the terminal without even explaining correctly what we are writing i abandonned this course because the instructions were not clear enough	0
when is the update	4
very boring presentation of the material	0
great support from teacher super clear explanation and excelent level of information	4
professor just reiterated text and readings lectures were poor and provided no insights	0
my difficulty in completing this course is that i am having to actually develop a playable version of a game the information in the course is excellent but it is taking more time than i have to develop the playable version of the game i used for the exercises	3
painful to watch and boring as hell	0
no good without the missing course and capstone projects	0
the homework is too time consuming	3
forcing users to install demo software which requires a registration is just too lameother than that courser is very boring introductory jumps constantly between things and doesnt explain much stack overflow and  hours would do a better job	0
very good introduction course for motion planning could be better if there is more interactions with the tas also the matlab assignments have some minor mistakes which takes time to figure it out	2
the content was very good and informative it just that i couldnt relate the later part of the module as i have not been a part of any industry as such	3
i enjoyed the course but quite frankly it was very basic	2
very informative	4
great course	4
it presents a lot of different aspect of macro economics in a really short time which is good but because of that it doesnt give a good understandings of each problemnice introduction but i will start another class on the subject which i would have liked to avoid	2
wonderful arrangment for learning	2
a profound intellectual journey take this course and immerse yourself in the beautiful nature of our universe	4
great ending to the three paleontology courses	4
algorithmic toolbox consists of a series of slides containing slimmed down explanations on introductory algorithmic concepts followed up with programming assignments the slides are the centrepiece of the course as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode theyre comprised ofi learned a lot during this course although to gain confidence in your knowledge this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectationsthroughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts treating them as they were trivial knowledge this applies to mathematical definitions proofs where most steps are skipped tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanationsall material is left equally weighted rather than providing explanations like we dont need to go into detail on this only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on reference this chapter in this book for more detail presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on i was often unsure of how much i would need to know about such conceptsin terms of communication ability the presenters dont hold up against many of the freelowcost services im accustomed to using for example mit opencourseware udacity edx khan academy code school treehouse etc perhaps unsurprising as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers but the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communicationteaching abilityin most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard rarely straying from the slides the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept you get a scribble in the corner of a slide lacking the clarity ive come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like youtuber patrickjmt or khan academy after a couple weeks into the course i just went straight to the slides read mits introduction to algorithms and skipped most of the course videosbut all things considered the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts regardless of where i sought it out	1
highly recommended for newbs in any kind of development otherwise waste of time	2
i dislike the way the grade is settled because of the difficulty and technicality of the course passing grade should be  out of  instead of  out of  we are not phds but student learners	0
interesting course with really useful information learning of course is easy because of many examples offered by teacher	3
basic introduction to data analytics	1
it was really hard to complete the course as not enough peer reviewers were there had to switch sessions twice	1
i learned a lot from this lecture and i believe the lecture is excellent except that if he could become a little bit funny then it would be perfect thanksclark	3
this course is very interesting and actualizedmy unique problem is about the certificate i need information about the quantity of hours duration	3
love poetry thank you for the inspiration	4
good courser to get started with the basics of programming and from here spring board to other areas	3
excellent course however tough to manage all the technical terms if youre a newbie 	3
having completed the assignment after many hours of trial  error here are some suggestions for improving the class for future sessionsincrease the length and depth of the lectures so that more of the materials needed for the assignment are coveredfor each week have an optional programming exercise not graded but with a model answer with explanations of why so that students have a concrete example on which to practice key concepts onas classes  structs are very important to completing the assignment instead of just including the swift manual chapter on classes  structs in the follow up reading include an actual lecture about this topicimprove the description of the assignment to be completed be specific about what is required eg what does interface mean is is a user interface or is just a specified variable which can be changed in the program code what do you mean by order of applying filters do you mean a variable which lets you decide order of filters and executes the filters accordingly or does the ability to manually rearranging the order of the calling of functions in the code sufficeimprove the alignment between the assignment and the review criteria the assignment asks for five filters but there is no matching criterion in the review criteria based on the current review criteria creating two filters would suffice to demonstrate ability to order and get full points for varying intensity for more than  filteri hope the remainder of the modules are better otherwise i will be extremely disappointed 	1
half of the links to external readings and videos did not work which is the reason i did not complete the course it made taking the quizzes fairly impossible unless i wanted to spend my time googling the answers	0
sorry but yet again a potentially great course spoiled by the implementation way too many mistakes in the quizzes peer review grading systems which in places are nonsense  i hope things get better and i give the the course the  stars the content would merit if it had been properly qced and delivered to best coursera standards	2
good homework and good examples	2
the course is acceptable however it should be called introduction to voip communication or developing voip applications rather than its current titleassignments are either super easy or never have a right answerpersonally i will not recommend this course for other who want to understand iot	0
great introduction to music theory in some sections the layout of the course could be somewhat better	3
this course should really be called basics of healthy cooking or for people with unhealthy habits it is very basic and very based on the us reality living in europe and used to cooking healthy food for my family everyday i have not learned anything new very disappointing to see such a basic course being offered by big names as stanford university	0
in general its very good the interview and other stuff in the bonus video should renamed as optional or other names its misleading people to think bonus as materials related for the class as the name is programming for everybody will be better if some of the explanations or slides can be linked with daily life cases for people to understand the concept easily	2
brian tries to achieve too much in too little time it addresses important issues and it gives a good overview including some hidden gems machine learning vs stats for example but it feels mostly too rushed and superficial for my tasteexpectations and it fails to connect to my previous knowledge and i have a phd in maths although no strong stats background hence little added value for me when i cannot relate to what is being discussed	2
this course barely touches c programming while explanatory about the arduino functions and structure it should have been spread into more weeks so that it could cover more	1
i learned a lot of useful information thanks	3
a little boring i spent lots of time on learning on an useless language rather than learning the spirit of functional programming i suppose to use ccpython or other normal programming language as the lesson language	0
tree exercise had absolutely no relevant video material videos give zero context for why data structures are important or when they are usedshould take a lesson from the stanford course	0
the course is very informative we can learn all steps for sanitation planning and design in urban context even though i have a lot experiences in water and sanitation issues either rural and urban areas but from this course i have more lesson learn about the key factor for success and learn from the failure that present in case study in this course	4
good content as long as you have some familiarity with programing and computer configuration	3
it is not very clear the assignments have several problems with the given code there are many things to improve in the next sessions	1
extremely lightweight and totally missing in substance i cannot recall whether they stated so in the course goals	2
few explanations no feedback after doing things wrong	0
not beginner friendly might be good as a refresher for grad students	1
what ive watched wasnt as what i expectedi would give it  out of  as addressing my needs	1
the first couple of weeks were awesome  love scala the language and the whole functional approach and the detailed description of how the language actually fits togetheralso love how the homework teaches you how to setup ide create unit tests and submit actual code as homework  not just workbooks and multiplechoice quizzes like in some other coursesbut why oh why was it necessary to go in specific detail over how to define natural numbers from first principles using classes or spend a whole week on lists etc all that might be fine for general education in a university context but as someone who does want to understand scala but from a perspective of getting cool things done  that bit was a total waste of timewould be a better and shorter course if those didactic bits were trimmed	2
basic but complete	3
the perfect beginners course for learning the basics explanations are clear and easy to understand you should definitely go through this course if you would like to begin your korean journey	4
while i love dr van lents teaching style i was somewhat disappointed in the course as a whole after about the first week the instructor was not heard from again on the forums it wasnt until about the last week that some official teaching staff started to make an appearancethis was an issue as especially in the first week as there was a good deal of discrepancy between what was on the grading rubric what was provided in description for the homework and what was in an optional video that described the homework all with no official direction as to what was correct or how things should be properly graded the students were just left to themselves to try and interpret what the instructor meant and what was the proper thing to do in regards to the peer grading this continued albeit to a far lesser extent through the remainder of the coursewhile i dont expect instructors to be in the forums all that often i do expect them to clear up obvious issues and to make some type of official statement as to how students should proceed i believe this was the first offering of this course and i hope as it offered again those discrepancies are fixed and perhaps more official teaching staff are able to monitor the forumsas far as the material itself it is pretty good and covers most of the basics well as i said at the start i really love dr van lents teaching style she is very encouraging and easy to understand she is also very human making mistakes as she goes along and correcting them i feel this gives the student a good experience of the real world iterative process that coding is that even with experience mistakes are still made and to be expected and how to go about doing some debugging to correct those mistakes	1
great course	4
this course gives a very nice introduction to functional programming whilst introducing you to the idiosyncrasies of the scala language	3
this is such a cornerstone topic to the data science specialization that i think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum the subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses finally i would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in introduction to statistical learning by hastie tibshiriani et al	2
the course introduces some basic concepts but fails to deliver on the objectives set out in the initial module description by barely listing out most topics through a very narrow linear approach instead of delivering an actual indepth explanation and commentary on the subject some more advanced learners will also find some tools to be outofdate and some areas  very googlefocused	1
many of the problem sets ask you to apply theorems in ways that have not been demonstrated if a student makes a mistake no feedback is given other than that is not the right answer	1
clear explanation of concepts	4
the course is basic and quite simple some might say too simple i think it should be about  week long i already knew all the things going into it so it was easy to finish it over two days	2
great course you need a few skills in mathlab to do the exercises atl least for me the mathematic language was the hardest	4
one of a good course on coursera	4
a weaker version of fundamentals of graphic design with way too much overlap it should not be included in the specialization	0
i have learnt a lot thanks	4
i think this course has very interesting information but it needs a way better format it needs agile presentations better infographics graphics and design and to be much more flexible and funi have not finished it but it does not make me get involved in the content even it is very interestingit needs a better script and handling of the information to be able to conect with new students	0
great course that really engages the learner i feel this course will benefit anyone city dwellers and environmentalists alike	4
i learned a lot about doing it the better way than i did what would have been cool the essential graphics from the videos and some school material to print out and work with itthx	3
the guided meditations were wonderful but the introductory lectures for weeks  were redundant and boring these lectures could have been much shorter and would have been equally valuable dr clifford sarons lectures were interesting	1
great specialization and wonderful instructors	4
the instructors are great and the material logically detailed the only problem is feed back or lack thereof the assignments are hard for a person who has minimal computer skills as described in the outline so having someone to go to for questions especially the programming parts are essential and this is lacking unfortunately apparently and i dont want to put words in someone elses mouth but the assumption is that the fellow students will have the missing information and that they will actually answer them that is not the case unfortunately so even though i emailed the instructors with no response i managed to obtain some information from other student who were extremely dedicated and much more advanced i may have entered the course at a minimal personnel time which may account for my perceived difficulty however from some of the griping i am not alone on the other one gets what they pay for and i was overall glad to take the course and respect all the aspects except for the one already mentioned	2
some parts of material is good quality but some is bad  also some show bad practices in r extensively use swirl as assignments over self work it is better to go through good tutorial over r base plotting system and ggplot	1
need a sub cant not understand what he is saying	0
thorough and logical explanations of programming concepts	3
very thorough and challenging classhighly recommended	3
well this course definetely has a clear message and a good purpose however it is very basic and coursera might not the right platform	0
definitely not for young new front end learners lots of things difficult to understand	2
this is a great course to get you writing the interviews with writers are particularly helpful the assignments are well thought out though there was some confusion when it came to peer reviews and how to assess word count which the staff are trying to sort out peer reviews were very varied as some people just wrote one word down which was no help at all while someone inexperienced wil struggle with this i think the course should include an early module on reading and critically as reviewing someones work is a great aid to writing and editing your own work course paperwork could include a critical checklist to help with peer reviews i would have found that helpful so that i could be confident of doing a good job i think you should also be able to edit your reviews as a mistake will mean your fellow writer could be marked down all in all though well worth doing many thanks to the tutors staff and guest writers	3
superb course well structured i learned a lot	4
there is a large difference between the skills acquired in the videos and the skills needed to fulfill the assignments there are errors in the videos and without the help of the uci help forum it is hard to get the assignments right you can acquire a broad set of skills interfacing with the raspberry pi but google is your best friend	1
get ready for a lot of frustration and independent research for being able to complete the course on continuous delivery the videos of the course are not a great help	0
the course is nice however the assignments are the same every time and the pace is too slow the final week suddenly too compact and testingyo is not assigned at all	3
it was a great experience definitely gained more knowledge about diplomacy	2
extremely dry academic style presentation could use a lot of work to make it appeal to others in the future lesser vehicle is also considered an insult in many circles not a good title for a class	1
course has good breadth and structure exploring the economic and political side of international energy however it would be good if a basic technical understanding of energy is incorporatedsome material is rather outdated  inaccessible	2
a good introduction to the organic solar cells world	3
scientific and detailed approach to design thinking for innovation	4
wonderful challenging course  sorry it ended  will miss the exercises 	4
very light and comprehensive content the geology part is pretty well explained	4
interesting overview of group psychology  but in essence just a bunch of definitions and statisticsi would have liked more focus on how the group dynamics works and how to influence these  and break the circle of unpopularity the tools to overcome the aggressive stamp etcalso i found the quizzes often had unclear and ambiguous wordinggenerally happy to have taken the course  but did not quite meet the description or my expectations off to the next 	2
i am mixed on this class i like it ok because it gives you a deep level of understanding behind the numerical underpinnings of basic machine learning algorithms but i dont feel like its helping me become effective at using them the course would get a higher rating if it focused more on practical applications and not so heavy on the algebra also it would get a higher rating if it used python rather than octave for the programming platform	2
awesome course  learn lot of new things a complete interactive course its fun while learning	4
an excellent course with real life examples that zoomed in on many of the essentials in fraud and forensics	4
not indepth at all mostly summarizes movie plots if youre looking for a very light overview of some introductory psychological principles this course is for you otherwise dont waste your time	1
excellent course with extremely detailed lectures	4
complete garbageitems not really presented in relevant details with respect to standard industry practices what you will learn here is not how things are done on the job	0
good basic information overview helpful instructor	2
the course content is great but peer evaluation is simply useless and almost random this specialisation needs to introduce an actual final assessment by an actual expert not peers	1
one of the best courses you may take to develop your business 	4
one of the best hands on learning course	4
easy to start the journey of learning python	3
id encourage some refinement of the quizzes for clarity purposes	2
in my opinion this course does not teach you to speak english professionally but it teaches you to learn how to speak english i was looking for a course that would teach me how to write professional emails and have professional phone conversations like which words i should use what common sentences are or how to build up professional sentences i am a bit disappointed and think this course was a waste of time for me this is really meant for people that are learning to speak english and dont know how to pronounce words or how to respond to people in a really easy way	0
dijkstra and a star algorithms courses are a bit short	1
vague content quiz and programming assignments not exactly related to video lecture content	1
needs to be a bit more complex and detailed in order to help people get a good understanding of the complexities and issues involved in project management please use real world pm uses not going to workshow examples of project management that went horribly wronglots of those examples as well	2
topics about supply  demand were interestingrest was too much theoretical for me i would have liked shorter presentations with more concrete examplesdesign of the presentations could be improved as well	2
this course had an excellent syllabus but left much to be desired in the methodology adopted for teaching there was very low involvement of the ta in the discussion forums and there should have been more material given to help bridge the gap between pre requisites and the course content	3
worst course ever i stopped partway through too many links to outside stuff testsquizes were not based on what was presented in the lessons test design is horrible too many negative questions glances over the good true information about nutrition to tell us about free range farms farmers markets etc which most people do not have access to or can not affordgiving it  star is being nicepeople who sponsored it should get their money back	0
instructor is too fast video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question	0
very easy to follow and informative class with clear explanations a perfect way to ease into seo	4
helped me understand the key challenges to public policy albeit to the ushowever many of the challenges are global and also impact the developing nations of asia	3
authors are too greedy for the course material	1
the female lectures speech is so fast and unclear even though the subject itself is very interesting but i have to leave this class	0
this course was more like a glossary not quite good but practical	1
great case study but the way to engage the audience might have been way better assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power because they were quite boring interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first  courses of the specialization capstone should have been done by the same high standards as other courses in specialization	2
most of the lessons are available for beginners of chinese it is useful to understand	3
it is a good course but if you want to hand on the assignments you have to pay so i am a little disappointed	2
very good introduction to machine learning concepts are well presented and explained i would have preferred to use a open source library in the assignments but is not bad to know how to use graphlab a very powerful tool for sure	3
nice overview with detail on smartphones the course cover a lot of detail and history of the oss but can get a little monotonous over the different stages of the os sometimes felt like just reading features overall i liked the course and thought it provide a very nice overview	3
a very informative and valuable learning experience highly recommended for the global citizen striving to navigate the often complex halls of international power and justice	3
watch one or  lectures before you join the course if you felt okay then go ahead otherwise dont waste your time and money something wrong in the course structure	0
the cost	0
far too easy	1
the course content and the assignments are too far apart i would have learned more if it was better aligned and there were some exercise in between	1
this course has lot of things i use to ponder about but never concluded it give some convincing approaches and some cool tips motivated me again to manage my time thanks you team for this amazing course	4
its a mix of too much basic and irrelevant tips from different realms pronounced english which in my opinion could be a great course of its own public speeking only the basic of how to deliver which can be sum up to one page and how to interact with other people like how to say you are agree or disagree i strongly believe that if a person can understand those videos im pretty sure that he knows that yearsoldextremlybasicstuffas much i like this concept of coursera speak english professionally or even speak english is really a big statement for that course actually from what it seems the main point of that course is to get the students to purchase the full package of courses that the georgia tech language institude is offering if you really like to know a great course that relates to the topic i strongly advise you to check out the course public speaking by dr matt mcgarrity here at coursera best of luck	0
thank you	3
the course is a very good overall description of the perception field the part i really liked is that there was no haste or a concept just superficially discussed  lectures are long and detailed the presentation of lectures especially from prof jianbo shi are excellent  to represent matrices in colours and give a intuitive sense of every formulaespecially the jacobians and treating the image blending process as painting the bad part of this course is that pronunciations of faculties could be a little unclear and hence a very good transcript is required  which in this course is not upto the mark there were few mistakes on the slides and should be rectified atleast in the pdf of the slides what this means is that we have to go through some frustration while watching the video first time which gradually improves on second or third view also there is absolutely no participation of teaching staff a good content should be supplemented with assistance to further enhance learning experience few doubts because of this remains unclear and i wish i could have got this sorted in this class	2
it could be much better the experience is old lms not mooc like there is lack of peer assignment forum is silent lecture is in boring formattone to slow quizzes are boring single or multiply choice questions  can be solve by tries and errors open questions are ambiguousi like content of this course i learned few new things but you have to work on form	2
this course is a mess do not even dare to take it without first doing machine learning by andrew ng excellent starter and before reading deep learning by goodfellow bengio courville the presentations are awfully boring there is little interaction of the material unlike ng who is deriving the math on screen hinton is basically just reading off the crowded slides very poor didactic style i would even go so far as to say that the approach is unscientific no definitions derivations examples terms just pop out of the blueif you already know the topic well you might gain additional insight from a pundit quizes are nice puzzles that need some thinking and math knowledge programming tasks are not even in the same ballpark as ngs overall very bad use of the medium availableinvest your time in reading deep learning its challenging but at least its got a very logical structure and style also consider hugo larochelles videos	1
i think this was a poorly structured online course especially for someone who is attempting this course having experienced two excellent previous courses in the specialization it was good only in few patches but the link was seriously missing i realize this area is a bit more advanced but with all due respect to the knowledgeable instructors they could have emphasised more on basic building blocks rather than cramming in so much information which my bandwith couldnt handle it i did guesswork in almost all the quizzes after week  which further adds to my disappointmenti think the robotics specialization is better off without this course because there is little or no value addition here expecting a lot better from the next course in the series	1
data structures was really interesting over all also assignments are quite challenging its important to check the external references  discussion forums if you want to get the best of it	3
way too basica bit more realistic and complex practice assignments will enrich the course	2
the way the tests accept the answers can lead to a very frustrating experience the test would mark my answers wrong for no reason sometimes i would change nothing between tests and get the previously marked incorrect answer correct besides this glitch however this course was great	1
got some new ideas to try out good content	3
much blaba lenghty lectures but less deliverycontent the second course from idea to startup is much better	1
it was really helpful i have  years of software development experience but never learnt python and after going through this course i could understand the power of it and how it can be used i could learn the concepts very well and of course had to google to refresh myself but its well organized and put together in a way we can learn easier and fasterthanks to dr chuck sometimes your comedy was above and beyond but at the end of the day it was a good course and learned quite a bit	4
i think that the course is redundant it is to general trying to capture to much and using a commercial program tool thats doing to much behind the scenethe second course in the specialization is really great though and you wont miss anything if you skip ahead	2
assignments were just not that challenging except first one	2
this course was a extremely introductory course in excel i would not recommend it to anyone especially at the cost of  aside from getting yourself thinking about using excel and some minor lessons learned i found it to be a complete waste of time	0
the material is very informative and generally well presented i would have liked more video explanation about the minimum snap trajectories as this was a large part of the final assignmentif the matlab resource was an actual desktop application instead of online the assignments would have been much easier and quicker to accomplish matlab online in my experience is slow and hard to work with in a single browser windowoverall i enjoyed this course	3
this course have very little to do with actual security most of the time you will hear about how to design applications and what is a good design policy	0
very nice basic course pretty understandable	4
i liked the course and found it informative but wish there were more stuff on shiny widgets and inputoutputrender topic r shiny tutorial is pretty good but i was hoping more relevant info about those topics from this course	3
great course i will recommend it	3
interactivity with javascript was too quick and short javascript by nature is much more complicated than html and css and therefore i believe that it should be done in a bit more than  weeks and broken down in to smaller bits of the basic info required to get a grasp on the materials for example the first assignment had too much in it for a beginner and a bit more homework in smaller bits of the code prior to the assignment could have make a huge difference for the better	1
i rate this course as a three out of five because i feel that during the worked exercise videos it would be much more helpful if only the correct code was shown its very confusing to see the wrong code typed in and then the correct code i think it would help students to more easily remember the function of code if only the right code is shown in examples	2
good course especially the doc and unit testing parts i had hoped for a more advanced implementations but thank you for mentioning the exec function	3
i found some slides to be inaccurate which makes the material difficult to learn also i found the instructors presentation style to be too abstract i think a more practical style would be more suitable	0
the course experience was a little bit weird its too easy for a dedicated programmer or it person but there are some obstacles to a person who are not familiar to the javascript programming and maybe python programming too the main problem is too small community i wrote some but never got any answer i think its due to the charging policy of this lecture	2
poor quality a disappointing experiencethe lectures are very basic thought for people that have no experience in programming this might be ok but the difficulty of assignments should follow instead they can be relatively hard newbie programmers will probably have an extremely hard time solving them considering that many of the problems they will encounter are not treated at all in the coursethe course does not focus enough on what differentiates r from other languages just a few videos on data types apply functions and a tiny little bit of scoping very unclear all these areas should have been expanded and the course should have had more arguments as wellfinally the assignments are not enough and their grading system is quite poor instead of submitting your code and testing it automatically you should calculate some quantities by hand and select the results out of a few possibilitiesall in all i was disappointed with the course	1
it really did help me to get started	4
not very applicable just a bunch of conceptsit feels like a very disorganised coursepaul harris is extremely repetitive and takes so much time to get to the point sometimes he overexplains unnecessary things his lectures need serious upgradelecturers speak too slow i have to use the x speed not to fall asleep	0
fantastic and informative course and good for the health	4
a good intersection of microeconomics and game theory very well structured	3
use of duke own specialised librarie  not the best way of learning progamming for the real world	0
i felt that i paid for demo of the datoturi	0
information was good a bit dry at points and the presenter didnt seem that enthused to be presenting overall decent course on an important and relevant topic	2
i enjoyed this course the mix of the video presentations and the powerpoints are well done the instructor does an excellent job the bonus videos and panelist interviews are very good as well	4
too much ideology need more tools to use in daily work	2
very hard to follow and to understand if you dont have any mathematics background or statistic knowledge but it is doable	1
very interesting and useful	3
the support from the faculty and the website is beyond explainable bad the user interface gets stuck without reasons there is no direct way to contact the faculty if you are stuck on any assignments there is hardly anyone who responds to the feedback that is sought fori will never recommend someone to do this course	0
this is an awesome class for beginning programmers the course content is easy and the instructor is very tho	4
lectures were a bit slowpaced but the information was great	3
good course the submit assignments werent always celar unfortunately	3
the first three weeks are totally trivial i hardly doubt that anyone learns something except how certain practices are called maybe good for school students week  is better i recommend the lecturer to improve the previous weeks and to redistribute some of the contents of week four some realworld examples which point out typical mistakes or give useful hints would be welcome in the first three weeks as well	0
stunning waste of time there is nothing of substance	0
a very interesting course i learned a lot will continue on the next course once it ready	3
very good course the only problem for me was the poor quality of the sound	3
the professor is animated and clearly loves her subject i dont think we need to stop so frequently to ask a quiz question though its best to keep going on one subject without interruption	2
this course shares a lot of valuable information but could use a good deal of refinement i really would have liked to have seen downloadable pdfs with the diagrams representing different models so that i could easily go back and reference them without having to find the particular moment in a video where it was shown i also wish the videos were designed with better instructional strategiesthe best coursera courses like those from northwesterns kellog school of management introduce material expand on it and then summarize the most important parts in each videothis helps the learner here the learner is on their own theres a lot of great information to pick up on but some retooling from the uva darden school of business would be greatly appreciated improvement	2
no basics being taught straight away code snippets are pasted	0
nice concrete course to take good info about graphs as a whole enjoyed it 	4
the course feels rushed i understand teaching machine learning in  weeks is impossible but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details eg trees random forests bagging and boosting all in  minutes each impossibleso as opposed to creating machine learning intuition i feel the course became an r package code book	2
fun lectures but the coverage is too simplistic looking forward to the more indepth courses in the specialization	2
exercise sources are not up to date i have come across many problems	2
it is good for beginners only	2
prof brian bushee is really excellent but i felt that prof chris ittners lecture was quite fluffy for an analytics course would have appreciated practice problems and case study practices like the operation analytics class	2
great course regardless if youre in school or working full time	4
it is told that to take this course basic computer skills like sending emails and downloading files are necessarythis is a beginning level course then in the first module instructors talk about polymorphism inheritance and abstraction for someone who have no prior programming experience these are definitely not suitable topics to start with moreover students are supposed to learn these concepts to get a good grade from first quiz although they know nothing about programmingi had some programming experience so i was already familiar with these subjects but the lectures were too boring to keep watching i watched like  videos and learned nothing about the course subject i think i wont be spending my time for this course which seems to me like reading some reference files	0
not useful by itself but grudgingly necessary to get you ready for subsequent courses in the specialization	2
visualized examples  good content but lacked engagement	2
i rated this as a  though i got a lot more out of the concepts and the class in the way it was taught than i had when reading books and literature on the subject i would have wanted more discussions with cohorts taking the class to help cement the practices by virtue of seeing it from other perspectives in different work environments i can imagine the same class with a moderator and someone facilitating the discussions would get me to the  rating in a nutshell the content is great the experience of the class could be at a higher level then what i experienced	2
pros very good information and methods for running real life business models the course provided the spreadsheet modules which allowed you to tinker around and learn them i consider myself a power excel user and i picked up some very good new modeling methods very concisecons i did week  on my lunch break some questions on the quizzes were a bit vague probably need some working knowledge of excel before taking this classif you need to complete a lot of modeling with your job this is a good course to pick up some skills	3
boring	0
nice but required a certificate of participation	2
the worst that i have taken so far please change the teacher or redo the materials explaining the concepts moreor at least give more extra material to understand the concepts better	0
excellent course professor raj has explained things in a very simple and power	4
the course is a very good start to learn nodejs strong recommend for anyone who wants to start nodejs	4
so far it is brilliant loved dr pritchards lecture on gettier cases	4
this was an excellent course with a wonderful teacherthere was fun and excitementi gained a lot of knowledge through this coursethank you everyone	4
wonderful class thank you	4
too simple and lack of practice exercises	1
very usefull but can be technical and discouraging	2
a must course for someone who wants to improve his learning skill	3
repeated the same viewtoo much time i think it better to teach more about methods all the worth is in the summary back of each unit you even need not to have the course	2
totally disorganized mismanaged unfairly graded course	0
prof rob stone is a very good speaker and has made the videos very informativethe content is very small which is good because it makes the course very lean but bad because it merely scratches the surface of project management world	2
course  was really enriching but this second stage didnt achieve the level that its supposed videos should be remake in order to connect with learners materials should be upgrade to fulfill expectations	0
simple and accessible introduction to machine learning for people without strong maths and it background can become quite slow and boring almost irritating if you come from an engineering or technical background some videos could have been summarised in half of the time	2
compared to the first three courses in this specialization this course is very unstructured the videos almost seem to scheduled randomly and a thread stringing everything together in a logical and purposeful way is completely missing learning anything from this course  at least for me  is very hard	1
as usual the  professorspresenters have done an excellent job the resources videos assignments and quizzes are very helpful well thought out and comprehensive they have done an enormous amount of workbut there seem to be problems with the import eduduke due to installation problems eg windows maybe include  videos like example from other coursera courses eg r programminginstalling bluej on a macinstalling bluej on windowsinstalling bluej on mac  including these would enable me to give a rating of  starsfor the beginner programmer this would help a loti know there is the discussions forum very helpful and students must sweat a bit to get bluej to work on some messy operating systems but this is my comment as a beta tester	3
assignments for week  and  were very tough and a little guidance was provided on how to do the coding part but since im interested in the course im reenrolling to complete it this time	1
this course is good to start with swift programming in ios this had help me a lot while not having much time to devote i appreciate this	3
i totally liked the handson approach and the nice presentation of the material on the other hand i felt a little left alone since there was no didactically planned interaction beyond the peer reviews furthermore a forum for discussion is nice but its a little sad if no one can answer course related formal questions you misinterpret the instructions and therefore receive a low grade	2
the projects are very hard and useless	1
very helpful and easy to follow	4
i just realized that you have to upgradepay  in order to submit the quiz and receive the feedback thats depressing since my purpose is to watch the video and check out what i learned so far without getting any certificate the policy here bring huge inconvenience for people like me	1
for those interested in taking exams these questions were poorly worded and it was evident that the person writing the questions in english was not proficient in the english language the material was interesting and up to date but much was lost in translation	1
this is a good course for pure beginner who never program before	2
it was a good course it is hard to make it useful and interesting for everyone since students will have varying degrees of knowledge coming in i know that i learned a lot that i can apply in my work	3
far too advanced for a total beginner as i am was really hard and very confusing my industry friends said it went too far for what i need in the real world	1
insightful introduction to health and nutrition	3
the extraoutside content provided is great as others have stated but clearly not adjusted some of the quiz questions arent clear items covered in the material which is frustrating	2
just great	4
amazing course	3
the course has excellent homework to help you study but the course itself sometimes doesnt cover more generally applied knowledge such as redblack bst also the professors teaching style may be confusing sometimes and require extra work to understand especially when they didnt have a pen in hand and were just talking quickly to the air i do hope the following series will eventually tackle these issues and ill be glad to give the whole series  stars	2
this was my first coursera course i ever completedas programmer most of the content i already knew but i believed there is also some info might be between the lines which it was actually true and in top of that it was fun all the waythank you dr chunck	4
difficult for beginners	1
i had difficultly with the two assignments not because they were difficult but because the instructions were not clear from reviewing others assignments it did not appear to be just me	2
this was fun as a refresher course if youre brand new to music theory this course wont help much unless you spend a lot of extra time learning the concepts using secondary materials google youtube and your own keyboard	1
it was pretty interesting although it may be fast at times i find it particular engaging and interesting i would definitely continue with the next course	3
very interesting	4
the content of the class is very nice it gives a nice overview on genetics and it was made accessible to many of us also mohamed noor is very enthusiastic and provides a lot of nice examples to illustrate the course however i think some parts of the class were a little bit dizorganized for instance i was sometimes confused by the vocabulary or the variable notations which are not always clear	2
its a difficult one i think less of reading work and more video lectures should be included	2
this course left me with mixing feelings i learned some new things but overall i dont think that i got understanding of base concepts week  seems to have disproportionately more material than previous weeks as though authors tried to although free this is course is also offered as a part of paid specialization and i would be really disappointed if id spent money on a course like this	1
i like the materials but i dont like that you need to pay to take the quizzes i think that it is against the spirit of coursera because it limits the experience of user who are willing to learn but dont have enough money to pay for the course many other courses allow you to take quizzes and do projects whitout paying	2
the assignments were hard not because of the contents of the courser but for understanding the context of the method being implemented what each variable meant and how it was expressedalso there should be a range of submissions that could be right but having higher or lower scores depending of how long it took to find the path or how long the path was to reach the goal	1
i am not impressed with this course so far the quizzes and assignments are out of order with the materials being presented  the questions on each come from readings and lecture content that have not been introduced to the audience at that particular point in the course the first module was a very very basic outline of a generic analysis process and really has nothing to do with digital marketing analytics in particular	1
as someone who doesnt have the time for a formal education i try to learn through my everyday experiences no matter how ordinary or monotonous they may appear this course opened my eyes to tips and tricks to make the best of my learning regardless of the task i happen to be involved in thanks for the h	4
ive only taken  classes with wharton online this and intro to financial accounting financial accounting is awesome it taught smoothly and explained things well this class jumped around and didnt give full explanations and had questions on one quiz that we didnt learn until the next week	1
i think it could be funnier	0
this is a course almost without any content you coul pick any book about game design and you will learn more of game design in the first ten pages i recommend level up by scott rogers for begginers like me you could be fooled by this course if you dont know the principles of design and narrative structure but if you know it you will not find anything of value here becouse dont explain almost anything about videogame concepts like gameplay balace game design etc they explain very basics things in the first course and then they forget everything the rest of the information are very very basic knowledge about character and world design without being vinculated through metodologies to the games only with empty words of inspiration recorded in useles videos sorry the critics but i followed all the courses and paid the monoey for the certificate hoping that some week the course could show somethign usefull never did see for books if you want to learn something	0
just fantastic	3
poor quality audio monotonous lecture style with frequent inaccuracies in delivery says one thing but actually means another i found my motivation and performance dropped sharply in contrast to prior lectures in this series	0
good coursehowever the initial part that is recruiting hiring portion could have been conducted in a better mannerit felt as if the lecturer was reading out from a text book	2
a course that provides an overview of the challenges faced by sustainable development efforts and the processes the maps programme practices to effectively tackle them i wish i could have access to the detailed models that were a main topic to more deeply understand the kind of effort that goes into creating and adjusting them and how they then translate into affecting policies	3
very good course whether youre a beginner or intermediate this course will boost your skills in html css and jsone of the best courses ive taken in a while	4
damn near worthless the course material has significant gaps of information the programming assignments require knowledge that isnt presented in the course i had to google my way through this entire course i would not recommend it	0
short and sweet very informative indeedthank you coursera	4
i am very disappointed about the content it is not a course pr david germano is just reading text no design no learning experience i would learn much better with just reading a book it is a shame i was very interested in the subject	0
less is more not always but it would be in this case a lot of the lectures are unwatchable for me	2
it is very easy and unusefull course	0
should be required for everyone even if you think you already eat healthily essential and uptodate information about food and health is presented in an extremely clear and engaging manner the quizzes are exceptional and youll know you learned a lot when you are not only able to find the right answer but correct the wrong answers in your head thank you so much for creating this course i truly hope it helps change the worlds eating behaviors and eliminates our populations chronic health crisis	4
nothing in common with reality nothing that can prepare for real interviewuseless loss of time	0
interesting course provides a good insight for beginners wish there were more assignments and multi choice quizzes	3
its good but depend only save informations than understand it	2
difficult for people without accounting background to take	2
this course does not do a good job at teaching the material the lecture videos gloss over the topics briefly but do not give a thorough explanation of the core topics of the course the quizzes will repeatedly test on terms not even remotely mentioned in any of the course materials	1
andrew is an amazing instructor his explanations are clear and easy to follow the course is by itself a great introduction about machine learning i found the course really useful	4
it had some useful tips on learning how to learn	2
an mix of general tips on how to write well mixed with some corporatespecific information broad overview but i didnt really learn anything	1
good stuff but a bit preachy	2
i am very disapointed about this course this course is more about how programming then teaching about programming in python the lecture is too long and information value is very low in my opinion this course is for somebody who never programming it is not depend in which language if you wont to know how if for functions works what is variable etc then this is the right place where to learn this basics	0
this was an excellent course the material was relevant the assignments were meaningful and the instructor was effective and motivating i highly recommend this course	4
no option of completing the course without paying so why do you call your site free online courses and why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignmentsi am a member of your site for many years and i have also recommended your site in many people	0
excellent course to understand the basic of finance field	4
to many text on the slides video resolution is not adopted for smartphone asus zenfone 	2
very helpful if you are picking up writing again not to time consuming the content is manageable and the instructor is very clear and concise	4
i liked and enjoyed very much but the discussion form is not good  i dont receive answers of my problems	3
the material in the quizzes is not adequately described in the lectures or notes some of the quizzes require  to complete with some problems being quite difficult most importantly i do not believe the course leaves behind an effective understanding of the material that would allow you to apply it i thought the aerial course was much better	1
the lecture just reads books	0
this course is basically about watching uninspiring videos it needs a lot of design thinking itselfi have bought the book however it is really useful	0
i would like to see some subtitles in spanish to help me understand much better the main idea  but in generally is so good and helpful	2
excelente thank you	3
the course is well prepared and paced its a problem based learning course it will teach you how to target various range of problems appropriately some lessons and exercises however needed longer time frame	3
great course this was very helpful and i recommended it to my colleagues thank you	4
disappointed  very technical course and not so practical for todays world there is a lot of terms and subjects that you require a good background in statistics analysis to understand well it is a shame that this take part of the specialization program	0
typically aimed at the us lifestyle	0
i have done the data sciences specialization from jhu and that was  star on  compared to that this specialization is pretty badnot worth doing this specialization instructors are clueless on the plan	0
most of the effort in the creation of this course seems to have gone into the visual and acoustic effects of the slides the first weeks material has no substance whatsoever literally the second week s presentations are just listings of lengthy definitions and best practices which in fact are mostly goals not practiceswith the poor quality of the provided videos my hope was that the reading would be better but the second weeks reading are uncommented links to a  page nist document an open online course and owasp materialat this point it is clear that continuing the course is not going to help me in the way i would expect it from a course when i compare this to the excellent software security course of michael hicks university of maryland  which i also attend on coursera there are worlds between bothi understand that cybersecurity and its ten domains addresses students with less prior knowledge but especially for such students i would expect a much better didactic approachone star seems harsh but after the first two weeks the only words i find for this are seriously	0
the interface of the classes is too straight not very flexible it almost looks like a real classroom which isnt good in case were at home learning by ourselves still it has a very good content	2
good learning of data analysis principles	3
i really appreciate the course professor charles explained every line of the code written by him and also gave real time examples and problems for assignments which is my favorite part id also be elated if the course fee had been a bit lesser than the mentioned as i cannot afford that amount for a single course nevertheless overall its a good course to enroll	4
because all of us owe it to ourselves to be a bit happier than we are now im finding this class is allowing me to give myself permission to be happy this is making a difference in my daily life i laugh more often  louder	3
muy poca informaciónvery few information	0
as a captstonse course i expected this to be more challenging than other courses in the specialisation especially the assignments which should have required to put in some real effort rather than simply executing prewritten scripts and uploading screenshots rest of the courses in the specialisation were superb combined with the awesome teaching skills of dr chuck but capstone was quite disappointing unfortunately	1
my laptop was not sufficiently fast to run oracle vm im using ubuntu and there where no other instructions for how to install the oracle dbms	0
i enjoyed taking this course very much the classes were well thoughtout and laid a good foundation for understanding python data structures while prior experience is helpful i think the lectures were clear enough for even someone new to python to grasp i would recommend this course to anyone looking to build on the basic knowledge of python	3
awful teacher	1
its very simple presentation for the topic i believe that coursera is a professional site for learners so  i dont think people who visit this site dont know these basic rules i mean what is to cc subject or stuff like these i thought the course give us more specific materials that we able to use when we write an email for example inside of the mail what rules we have to consider or what words or word structures we should use	0
no feedback from quizes it doesnt even show you what you have answered makes it very tedious to study the material i like the questions during the video that is an addition that ought to be used more often because it forces you to remember and learn faster	1
good course bad arrangement	2
nothing short of being excellent	3
very superficial and inconclusivethe course professor focuses more on himself than on the material	0
i loved this course and i believe i gained some valuable skills and knowledge by taking the course	4
not very informative and too simple also there is way too much repeating	1
i liked your course it is very thorough but the stories and acting parts get a bit cheesy i would have appreciated a course more finely tuned to serious learners it seems geared towards high schoolers	3
this has ruined my life	0
fantastic course gives a real good understanding of ml	4
this course is great but brian is certainly not a good instructor he does not explain things well and articulate examples i had to take statistical inference from duke university to pass this course	1
i couldnt access all of the reading materials and could never finish this course	0
while i enjoyed the projects and found the instructor easy to follow and understand i was disappointed in how little coding we did the code walkthroughs were rushed and i barely learned enough to scratch the surface of some of the scripts we used in the basic projects since scripting is such a huge part of game development i feel like there should have been more focus on it maybe a new term in each video or somethingand i understand that the course was only four weeks which doesnt allow much time for deep scripting analysis but maybe the course should be longer than four weeksoverall a fun class and i now have two games to show off to people	2
excellent course learned a lot on the nuts and bolts of optimisation some of the promised downloads are missing though in the resources section same goes for a few links but the links one can look up one ones own not so the downloads and there have been no response despite repeated posts in the help section hope this will be remedied	3
the content is interesting but the presentation can be improved so that audience will not fall asleep easily	0
great course covers almost all the r concepts	4
there is a gap between the instruction level and the difficulty of quizzes and final projects	0
good course for beginners its very basic if you already have some background in language studies i would recommend this course to people who are considering studying language or linguistics at university	4
just finished with the st module but so far the course is excellent only took  to  hours to complete the module	4
the instructions for the final project were very unclear and even though i submitted all assignments well before their respective deadlines and reviewed the required number of projects my work was not processed for a grade thereby delaying my specialization completion	1
great course although i wouldve liked a bit more emphasis on coding	2
i expected something a little more faced paced from berklee but it was still good	2
it is a very good course where students get to learn about supply chain management people who are looking for deeper knowledge about scm can opt this course my only suggestion to this course is that they need to improve the quality of the videonot the content and increase the difficulty level of the exams	2
enjoyed learning python from chuck	3
this course was difficult for me to grasp the instructor i believe assumes that all participants have some background in programming and since i do not i have a very difficult time following the examples i bought the entire series of classes but need to retake this one after i read some more from other sources and have had a chance to digest whats here	1
excelent teacher and course	4
extremely boring teacher	0
great course if you want to learn python for the raspberry pi take this course	4
very condensed and practical good fit for the ones who already have some experience in ds using other tools like r	4
in todays rapidly changing society in order not to be left out it is of utmost importance to practise lifelong learning this course is extremely useful and timing given the global changes it provided me with useful information and helpful tips for making my learning more effective i believe that if i practise the tips shared in this course i would be able to learn effectively for lifethe course was presented in an interesting and easytounderstand manner the pace was a tad slow for me as i am only taking two moocs but i find that this pace would be just great if you were taking many moocs or if you were not a native speaker of englishi highly recommend this course to anyone who would like to supercharge their learning	3
putting some numbers on the slide without any explanation of how it works only saying what it doesreading almost only his slide without further informationno basic formulas such as eg shannon theorem	0
i suppose that we should have some basic knowledge of data visualization before this course there are no practical sessions i could not understand many topics and it seems that content has been missing from this course	0
i am not very happy with this course it lacks depth reading the text book gives more understanding the videos are just verbatim repetition of what is there in the book the concepts are not explained well no examples and no case studies and further there are errors in quizzes the first course in this specialization was really good course  and  were also very informative but  and  are not up to the mark and not meeting the high expectations set by the previous courses	0
boring techniques for rememberingnothing related to learning or understanding	1
the capstone starts well with sufficient guidance the second part gives much freedom however it might be overwhelming and unclear at times what to do next however i loved going out on my own and slowly learning more and more on the subjectyou can pretty much choose how much effort you put into it	4
good to understand a broad concept of business metrics	3
not recommended not clear why we need to use r and learn all this statistics not practical for use in ux design	0
a great course to get you started	4
the course content is very superficial the pass mark is very high for a course i had taken because of a mild interest you have to get  to pass one unit in particular was very confusing it took me  attempts to pass it as i had no idea what the first question was about and there was no guidance as to what i was doing wrong	2
probably i wouldnt have a course just about how to hirebuild a data team	2
testing choice isnt great writing a letter outline etc and submitting it for peer review would have been more productive furthermore some questions in week  test are confusing the original meaning the test designer is trying to convey is which dictates what the right answer is isnt clear giving too much room to interpretation not allowing the answer to be empirically right	2
the last lecture was too fast would be good to divide this into two parts rest all is great stuff	3
very high level syllabuses limited application description of bd poor quiz and questions designed	1
great introductory coursedefinitely urging me to pursue more astrobiology courses	4
well done excellent quizzes and reading and recordings there were some sound quality issues not all recordings were of same quality some  esp in first few videos were hard to hear and had some noi	3
an interesting overview but i wish it had been a bit more rigorous	2
this course is great for everyone interested in working on their writing skills whether youre a beginner or more experienced as a novice writer i learned about several useful tools that will help me improve my writing got a lot more practice and having a schedule helped me improve my daily routine for writing for me the most valuable part was getting feedback and learning through analysing other peoples work oh and just because the description says  hours of work per week doesnt mean you cant do a lot more	3
basically just a product demo and the lecturer was very hard to comprehend	1
its not a university standard course its more like introduction to introduction diy swift the videos are chaotic and lack explications examples exercises and practical assignments much better intro to swift can be found on many youtube channels or just on swift documentation website	0
one of the best machine learning lecture	4
please stay away from this course	0
terrible had to verify multiple times audio quiz had no sound struckthru speaker icon i couldnt fixid be disappointed with cousera for foisting this trash if i hadnt taken learning how to learn much less buggywould disenroll if there was any way to do so	0
this is very helpul course	3
amy blooms assignments were so complicated and obtuse that they were hard to dive into the lectures didnt particularly hold me  either often what the lecture was titled and what was taught seemed totally unrelated could be improved but at least it kept me writing	1
really interesting	4
very helpful and it is a good intuition for machine learningrecommend	4
this course helps me learn the fundamentals of cs	4
a really interesting course on a fascinating and often misunderstood topic it could be vastly improved by doing away with the peer assignment review requirement	1
the subject matter is of great interest to me but unfortunately dr silverman standing paralyzed before a projected backdrop and lecturing in a monotone doesnt do it too much talking head actually motionless body and too few visuals of course material im sure hes a brilliant man but an adequate lecturer he is not if hes so shy he might just do voiceovers i have dropped the course and will just read the book i would not incidentally rate the course at an intermediate level beginning would be more accurateonscreen videos are bad enough being at one remove from the classroom but onscreen videos of an immobile monotone lecturers will kill any subject	1
lots of overlap in the videos not a lot of information on c features too few handson activities with the features taught	1
professor is good and funny and subject is interesting but thats all very basic course very easy to follow and not at all challenging also maybe because being that easy peer review is compromised by people who doesnt really know what theyre doing there with comments that were clearly made without any knowledge about the subject	1
very technical and focuses more on cosmology than on the principles of philosophy of science	2
very exciting course	4
the videos do not adequately prepare the students of the programming assignmentsthe instructor should provide more support regarding the homework	1
i dropped on week  there was just the required minimum for a mooc i did not find it engaging too bad as i was genuinely curious of the topic	1
the test questions are abysmal	0
some of this content is glaringly wrong eg that f roosevelts freedoms werent seen by him as inalienable rights that culture and education were attributes of eleanors approach to freedom that were distinctive from fdr one can go on and on 	0
this review does not reflect the course content the new coursera ui makes it impossible to download transcripts or slides of the videos without these features following the lectures is significantly more difficult and i cant rate this course any higher than  star i would rate it zero stars if that was possible	0
provides a comprehensive overview however it is heavily lecture based would be nice if more interactivity was built in via popup questions during the lectures and practice problems	1
gives a good overview of topics and the specialisation however is still very basic im looking forward to the next advanced courses	2
the teacher in the first few weeks is hard to follow it sounds like he reads from a paper and he barely writes anything on the slides it sounds like every sentence he says is crucial to understand which is hard to follow the other teacher does a much better job at this the course would also greatly benefit with exercise material so you get a better feeling of calculating these things	1
this course has more interesting material than the previous one landscape but again the assignments are based on theoretical essays than on practical tasks case analysis etc	2
i thinks it only happens to me i found things are a little unorganized for me who doesnt speak english as mother tongue but the videos and quizzes help me a lot to understand	2
good content and great assignments main problem is that the lecture videos are unscripted and could easily be made more concise the other thing that worried me was that most of the assignments that i peer reviewed had missed large parts of the question i would rather have my work marked by people who have read the question properly	2
the course material itself is good and you do learn a lot but for a course that starts at complete beginner level the final exam is too much of a reach for many it feels like the course should be at least  longer as in that exam you are literally trying to stitch ideas together into educated guesses i got  plus on all of the course work it needs work to narrow the gap as this is not good learning it frustrates many and is not helpful	2
if you have time it is a good course to start to understand how seo works if like me you work and dont have time it can be a little too much useless especially in some parts of it	3
great course with a lot of real life examples	4
finally a course on the subject good insights and format with short videos on theory mixed with interviews with experts within the field	4
not happy about the course very very general information this can be obtained through any internet reading and doesnt require a purchase of the course  dollars is not peanuts for many countries the lecturers often refer to the videos which are not part of this course examples ppp valuation has not been part of lectures but is referred to maturity and duration of the bond comparison with the glass of water is referred to but was not part of the course for the money  we are getting some shorter version of a bigger course not satisfied at all just finished all the tests and passed but not happy do not recommend to anyone and surely will not buy the next course	0
very useful course learned a lot about bootstrap	3
good but i thought it will cover most of sas technology but it has covered basics only 	2
maybe if youre just starting out and using the same software as prince charles this class would be more useful even so the audio on this has got to be fixed especially since this is an audio class about mixingi learned a few vocal layering techniques but this is a really beginner class and is very dawspecific if you arent using the specific software the information here will only be valuable for topical concepts because if this watching the videos arent much help visually but then its an uneasy listen because the audio levels in the videos are so uneven that you can barely hear the professors voice on a common speaker and then you get blasted when he turns on an audio clipthe way he explained things also felt a bit slow and dragging to me i teach young children and it seemed reminiscent of the way i have to talk to them sometimes then theres this really awkward and long interview with his musical colleague week  who didnt seem to know much about what he was being asked and while watching their conversation its totally apparent in the professors face that he wasnt getting the output he wanted from the guythanks for the vocal techniques i hope this feedback is helpful	2
a good introduction to finance but its just a starting point	2
to basic	2
well presented but this course should be optional in in the specialization there isnt really enough material to justify it but it does cover the basics for someone with little to no development experience	2
excellent course well presented and full of great information thank you for taking the time to offer it	4
too many issues with the dbs that needed to be accessed to complete the exams	2
this course is really bad i didnt understood anything until by myself and with tutorials i could do it	0
it is a good course	3
given this is the third or fourth iteration of this course its telling that the errors from the original release remain in the videos and quizzes there are other higherquality data science moocs available	0
clears the basic git bash commands and helps to install the basic software required to analyze data properly	4
although im only the first week there are two main comments id like to makefirstly why are the lectures subdivided with the ridiculous overlong and irritating introduction for each section in lesson one this was repeated  times what a waste of timesecondly the transcripts are in rich text which is basically unreadable has no line breaks which makes reading the poems impossible and the transcripts are poorly transcribed making them illiteratei feel i may not continue with the course for these reasons even though the content is really interestingthis is the worst presented mooc i have encounteredi have completed  and am undertaking another  with edxcel and with futurelearn	1
not for beginners in the slightest enjoyed the videos but the quiz just made me feel stupid as i didnt have a clue on any of the equations and simulators i was supposed to use it got me thinking of how ignorant clever people continue to be every time a smart person comes up with a new theory its taken as fact give it a couple of decades and someone will prove it wrong the sun orbiting us proving wrong easth is flat gas giants only orbit outside the habitable zone etc etc etc so when will we learn that just because something happens on this planet doesnt mean it will has happened elsewhere the deepest depths of the ocean have life forms yet wed perish so whos to say life forms cant exact on a planet moon that is nothing like the earth the world is still at the centre of the universe to these academics	2
great course on introductory computer programming the video lectures are clear concise and wellproduced quizzes and assignments integrate and reinforce learning objectives well while still adding new challenges the fact that instructor areti manataki is gorgeous very articulate and knowledgeable and enthusiastic is an added bonus	3
i am i week  for now i found this course very attractive	4
there are some errors on the quizzes in between the videos i had to skip a lot of them because it woundt accept the correct answer i liked the testimonial videos	2
of all the offerings in the specialization this one felt like it was thrown together in less than hour i expected to have to learn quite a bit of material on my own but even the references to additional materials were very thini could have saved many days if more guidance on the project workflow would have been given the preprocessing of the data was quite extensive  steps before generating the ngram tables i used in my model and was the key to getting decent results imho but one had to step on a quite a few landmines to figure this outthe problem was an interesting one and i ended up reworking it after passing with  the only class in the specialization i didnt get  on because i didnt have time to implement much of what i had to figure out by hardknocks	1
a very interesting course with great professors teaching	4
iam lahcene ifind this courses befor begin it very nice so iwould to focused it withe learning mucht timesbest regardslahcene	4
this course is actual for mac machine all instruction are for mac only i use windows so it unuseful for me	0
i give  star for the teacher really approach having such a wellorganized teaching materiali also give  star for the homework assignment and its almost graphlab only approach yes it mentioned alternative approach which is much more popular than graphlab but there are many bugs  trivial difficulties to get it through with scikitlearn as a great open source package the only reason i suspect to choose graphlab is commercial purpose for me if the homework assignment is only instructed properly for loading data into pandas i can finish each programming assignment within  hour for sure using scikit learn but now it takes  minutes and i still cannot load the data correctly i like to get a certificate but it is not necessary and spending too much time is a waste on my time	1
quite informative about project decision criteria gathering capital for firm about mergers and acquisition and at last about risk management	2
 star for the course the videos are longer than needed because the instructor could be telling his stories in a more structured way theres too much selfpromotion or maybe thats normal in the us star because the final assignment gives a lot of insight although its on the long side	1
the very first lesson implies that sufficient quantities of micronutrients cant be obtained from a diet high in animalbased proteins and fats in reality organ meats and egg yolks are higher in micronutrients than many fruits and vegetables and only small amounts of darkcolored veggies and fruits are required to balance a diet that already contains a variety of meats as far as both species and cut the body is also better able to synthesize glucose or utilize ketones instead of glucose to fuel cell function than to synthesize amino acids which are more easily obtained in the correct amounts from animal sources plantbased diets work for some people but if blood sugar levels chronic inflammation andor amino acid intake are issues that an individual needs to take into careful consideration a highfat lowcarb diet with a variety of animal products is more likely to meet their needs	1
not much helpful course	2
ok but was expecting better i was missing the structure a little bit	2
great course the concepts and theories have been explained thoroughly but i also believe providing a few reference materials would have been better for a theory oriented course like this oneoverall still the best could theory course online	3
the professor and instructors dont understand how to properly write sas programs and ignored constructive feedback its very sad to see students follow suit by producing hard to read codes ignoring programming conventionsas an analytic leader in healthcare industry i am supervising some of my junior level team members to get some basic training i want to say something to the students graduated from this course if you program the same way as being taught you will lose a competitive advantage during job interview	0
would not let me leave course after signing up due to family issues i could not continue but due to some weird policy after purchasing this class i could not drop still cant	0
a giant and complete waste of time  and  month of work and its all javascript no java worse yet you are required to work in bluej google it with custom javascript functions that you are not allowed to view or use outside the course so none of the code you write in this course will ever be able to be used anywhere else the functions probably are in a minified file but the students were not given access to that file a complete waste of time i would give it zero stars but cant submit this rating without giving it one star	0
i think this course could have been done in two  minute videos it jumps in with overviews but contain some high level items you wont understand until later in the course and it really doesnt give enough context to be meaningful at the time it almost seems like it was thrown together without a clear mission of what should be in the introduction being a developer who has used some of the tools in this toolbox git github command line this intro really glosses over tools that most non developers wont understand if i had a say in what should be in this intro it would be one video end to end of setting up the tools the second video would be all about the history and logic and some of the applications we will be exploring without all the r formulas in the slides	1
this course has valuable information but it is ultimately political the professors dont even disclose that there are two opposing historical schools new historians whom palestinians reference and traditional historians favored by most israelis which version is followed here the answer is a mix without identification this is not the same as balance which would entail each side laying out its key points and evidence as others note there is zero reading material one wonders if this is because to choose a historian is to choose sidesthat is how divisive this topic is the discussion forums are also poorly monitored unlike other coursera courses which does not advance understandinga little knowledge is a dangerous thing unfortunately applies to this condensed intro course and contrary to expectations for an offering from tel aviv u most israelis would likely be offended by some of its assertionsomissions for example israelis recall that palestinian founding father haj amin alhusseini was a nazi agitator in europe and bequeathed an antijewish ideology netanyahu even made a speech about this in  that was covered internationally yet in this course you will be told simply that alhusseini was a man of religion	1
very interesting and instructive ideal to start in the world of internet of things for people who have not yet known	4
it should be merged with course 	2
i must say that the capstone project was a good assignment the issue is that the peer reviews were bad i had to resubmit my assignment due to a student that choose to give me s when the other reviewers gave me s there was also a bias to what each reviewer thought the capstone should cover so you had no idea which direction to update your work because the next reviewer may feel that the type of analysis you did was not necessarythe course needs a specific rubric and specific methods each person has to use in order to complete the assignment for example must use the four forces model when evaluating strategy this way everyone knows what to expect and what to look for otherwise you can get a low grade on a great project because a classmate thought you should have used another model so he gave you a  or  when the model you used demonstrated your knowledgecapstones need to be monitored either by a student or assistant to protect against trolls that dont read your work and give you the lowest score otherwise the course was great and the information was definitely well put together the peer reviews brought my overall grade lower because i didnt get the high mark i should have	1
thanks to mr jogesh for carrying out complex concepts with ease	3
very efficient and tothepoint hands on learning and teaching	4
perfect so far as this course gives the rational behind each solution and explains it in a simple manner for many who have a basic understanding of vector calculus	4
i felt the course went far too fast and is definitely not a course for beginners i gave up after the nd week and i now feel more than ever overwhelmed by setting my own website	0
its a great course which helped me in a greater extent to enhance my concept in algorithm	4
this course is way tooooooo easy for me im a phd candidate in statistics i think it will be nice if i can have a diagnostic survey to test whether this course is suitable for me or not before the course	2
this excellent course is exceptional in that very few moocs are taught at this graduate level others have pointed out that while this is an introductory course to probability graphical models i would say that this is still an advanced course with lots of prerequisites prof koller is an excellent lecturer yet moves fast and youll need to do reading to fill in the gaps i havent been able to find a good book to accompany the course as her book is pretty dry i strongly recommend one complete all of the honors assignments to get a lot out of the course the discussion boards are not so active with plenty of unanswered questions doing the programming assignments will greatly enhance your skills in debugging	3
very dry content and hard to retain any information presented in the course because of it quizzes are fairly easy to pass provided you have some programming experience	1
nice teacher but the course is too succinteach lecture is very short and theoritical with little visual content the course couldshould be more detailed and a section of the course should relate to backyard chicken farming as well i wish there also had been a section on how to recognise different illnesses in chickens and demonstration on how to humanely kill a chicken for examplei enjoyed the course for what it was but i wish it had been taught with far more depth and breadth	1
good course for greenhand	3
could not get to the fourth course and was asked to pay for it twice	0
really enjoyed the challenges it made me face with designing my own booklethas inspired me to do more	3
i understand it was a more practical course but still more information would have been great same assignments but more information would have been great other courses had more videos	1
i am giving this  stars for one reason although the instructor was terrific and the subject matter interesting you cannot take the quizzestests without purchasing the course i like to test my retention of the material as i am an elderly and retired auditonly student and have no interest in getting a certificate or using the course for college credit i found that offputting and dropped the class hopefully other coursera courses are not going to adopt the same requirement	2
liked it very much the exercises however could be better explained in some parts	3
i am very disappointed with this course i had to wait too long on grading first time i got not naff points then i had to wait for about few months on grading i will not take capstone for this course because i suppose i would wait about a few years on grading this course has to change grading process because has no adequate number of students for peer review	0
i do not think that students should need to pay for a course in order to watch interviews with previous graduates half of this course should have been condensed or excluded there is not much to learn in these modules it was decent but it was not a five star course i think the ratings on this are misleading	1
the course was very interesting and thoughtprovoking i found the introduction to probabilistic graphical models pgms and their properties struck a nice balance between intuition and formalism the discussions highlighted exciting aspects of their power in simplifying complex problems involving uncertainty however i still do not feel i could propose convincing pgms for realworld problems there are examples in the course but they are far removed from being concrete applications i would have preferred there be an in depth analysis of an application of pgms in the literature over the lengthy programming assignments i am an experienced programmer with over  years of experience in many languages including matlaboctave and i sometimes found it uninspiring to solve toy problems not due to the difficulty in using the programming language but rather because after the assignment had been completed i felt i had not really learnt much more than i would have from just watching the lectures although if you are interested in getting experience with matlaboctave the programming assignments are good practice i qualify this in stating that i have not yet completed the next two courses on pgms this course may present an essential foundation that is necessary for the upcoming courses and in any case provoked my interest in learning more about them	2
i found the video lectures very choppy and difficult to watch	1
perhaps this class would be good for a non  native english speaker i went through the first maybe five videos from what i could tell i learned all of the stuff in this class by the age of  if this class is for people who english is a second language it should be more obviose	0
the content seems rather thinner than that of earlier courses in the specialization and seems to get more so as the course progresses week  is entirely spent on precision and recall with only about  min of lecture it feels like there was a rush to get the course out and that corners may have been cut at the endand as others have mentioned several very important classification topics are conspicuously missing	1
too many information just to be said	1
doesnt effectively explain how to implement the nn	0
an excellent insight about the changing and thinking can be applied to anything and anywherenot only for the managers as a person in this changing world you should know about this its not only for the managers but for every indicidual	4
a very nicely addressed course for the nonfinancial professions to apprehend short and tothepoint however if the course provided a nonpaid certificate just for keeping purposes it would have attracted a wider audience but overall worth putting efforts and time into 	3
assignments at times a bit hazy and there is very little guidance in general the types of assignments do not lend themselves too well to peer review this is far off the standard set by courses  and  lectures seem a bit generic and although liz gerber tries to make it hands on the subject matter really doesnt seem anywhere as tangible as when klemmer presents it	1
the course is very good explained however the practice relies a lot in code that cannot be explained like applets or mapping components sometimes you need more time to go through the documentation of a graphic library that you will never use again than in doing the actual assignments core thing	2
this course provides useful knowledge in building r packages as well as opportunities to implement our knowledge however as the previous courses in the series the last module week is extremely challenging compared to the previous ones	3
didnt like trying to hammer in recommended activities into my lessons would be better to create new material and use that	1
this course provides fundamental principles for learners to get familiar with teaching english and it paves the way for further education for tesol	4
too many videos and texts	1
the contents of the course were good enough the assignments though simple required some work in terms of understanding the kind of data that you are dealing with which is important although a lot of content has been covered it was arranged in a logical manner	3
nice but very basic	1
starting from week the way of explaining the materials isnt good	0
some contents are overlapped especially lesson  feels like a recap of all previous lessonstool list is really helpfulother examples could be written in more detailsthe narrative is easy to follow reasonable pace of speech	3
awesome course given by a very charismatic instructor with the curious participation of his  furred sidekicks the contents of this course are very useful for our everyday life by helping us increase our awareness of mental processess also very useful for people who are willing to start meditating and improving welfare	4
too much ppt and theory while little examples and real code	1
good intro and fundamentals but focuses far too much on finance	2
i think the teacher has opportunity areas in terms of keeping the audience engage	2
not the best one on coursera included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it	1
since im working on water modelling computational fluid dynamics programming shallow water simulations i thought it would be fun to learn more about the political side however this course has very little indepth information pun not intended and i would like to know more about the actual tools used to design water policies though the course is most likely too easy for most university students it is also very abstract and i would have liked having to do a little more thinking on the realworld examples myself	2
the lectures were nothing more than a person reading from the reference text there seemed to be a lack of understanding of the materialeven the jokes were taken from the book without credit to the author	1
the videos and lessons are very good and are taught in a fun and lively manner dr dixon and dr cinco are at their very best as alwaysthanks a lot to them	4
great overview	4
great value for money you need this course if you want to upgrade your knowledge of the digital marketing mix	3
make your have some idea about learningand the tips mentioned in this course really help you in your future learning	3
the course is interesting but topics are sometimes way too difficult to follow through maybe the hardest is that there are few exercises during classes to test the given information so the grading tests become really hard to pass	1
im here learning excel skills but this course especially week  does not teach excel skills	1
i was really really hoping that this course would be educational i personally work with an individual with as and i excepted to have a better insight into some of the things he goes through so far however i have found many of the lectures condescending as a person with a disability i find it highly offensive when people speak like theyre doing the person with whatever kind of disability a favor for even helping them people with disabilities are just that people	0
may be my english is too bad but i found this course too difficult to understand especially pick all the right answers in a list	2
its really helpful to learn such course from coursers amazing experience 	4
bad video quality and errors in course material worst course on coursera	0
not that good if you have experience with other programming languagesits waste of time and money you should take it as audit	1
great introduction to python in easytounderstand chunks having finished this course im really looking forward to completing the next items in the specialisation if youre wondering if codings for you or if you can do it  this course will get you started coding with zero tears its totally worth it	4
excellent course some basic tecniques of machine learning are implemented in python and sas	3
way too easy i was expecting more information in nutritional sciencestill theres some useful tips for us to choose good food and improve our health	2
quite comprehensive entertaining course unfortunately not being able to submit the assignments without paying a fee is rather offputting  especially taking into account were talking about peertopeer reviews	2
it is a very informative course well taught 	3
too much focus on remembering specific details and numbers and too little focus on broader understanding	1
thank you for the excelent course	4
i only finished week one so far my opinion to the first weeks content is that its a little bit hard to familiarize all those basic r concepts from scratch maybe the teaching staff would want to make it more concise so that before any real application or simulation students do not get lost in those technicalities however its pretty great course its pretty detailed and informative	3
very average this time around not as design focused as the title of the course leads you to believe	2
i loved this course i particularly enjoyed the programming assignments which taught me a great deal and were extremely satisfying it is terrific to see a truly rigorous mathematical engineering course on coursera i will gladly sign up for the next course in the series	4
covered the material i needed to progress into mathematics provides nice intuition about the concepts very engaging	4
this course is the right choice for someone who wants to get a highlevel overview of the various fundamental concepts in machine learning and provides the zeal to pursue further concepts have been explained by the lecturers really well and quizzes and assignments help us to validate our knowledge of the concepts in a seamless manner	4
some of the lessons arent clear enough to follow	2
i feel that the course does cover adequate topic to improve our mastery of data analysis in excel the course is more focus on the statistic and probability theory without giving adequate explanation on how to work on excel	1
i did the free part of the course it was too simplei did other free moocs that had much morethe videos were like reading a book the subject is interesting and theres some potential to the practical part of the coursei only did the first  weeks	2
if you think this is an introduction to java programming language you are wrongwhat do you want do you want teach us to use processing or teach us to program in java	1
its very basic suitable for beginners	3
the course is very complete on its subjects and points but should have more slides and some times be more grafic about some examples this makes the lessons boring and harder to follow because there is a massive amount of informations also have too much questions on the quizzes	2
not for those with no background in advanced engineering math expect to pick up independently most of the things that are being taught	2
enjoying it and its helping alot in my unit	3
the first segment on why digital changes everything is good background but the rest was too abstract for me with nothing i could really take away and practice	0
this course is a sequence of sales pitches by hlavacs relations the continuous invitation to purchase a course where companies advertise their products is a shame and lacks in depth material followed the whole course in the hope it would get better but unfortunately got more irritated than educated	0
had i taken this course without prior knowledge of the subject without a doubt i would have quit the course after the first lesson as it is i gladly clicked the unenroll button after  mins into the start of the instructors week three video i honestly dont know why i bothered to continue torturing myself as long as i didjohn holbo makes grasping plato more complicated than it needs to be in fact his lessons are nothing more than useless white noise and ill attempts at humouri recommend not taking this course it does not offer any enlightenment but will only obfuscate and turn people off from wanting to understand plato	0
way too basic for the price  almost no content  this is just setup  i resent paying for setup instructions	0
boring didnt have strength to finish	0
an excellent course the lecturer was engaging the material was interesting  i have a basic economics foundation and i found that my understanding of these basics improved even while i feel much more empowered to have an opinion on policymaking in the worldit was great to be able to complete a project even though the course is ondemand	4
very hard for beginners very boring for others also missleading concepts	0
to fast pace and missing lot of content to make this lesson enjoyable	1
interesting	2
given that python  was replaced by python  some  years ago im dismayed to see that this class is teaching python  instead of python 	0
i do not find this course is useful to learn seems it only gives a guideline to the python database	2
weather its an act of selfinterests or not i dont really care fact is after viewing few videos into the starting point where the legit content should appear i decided to stop it is a waste of my timehe is either not teaching and providing the real solutions or he doesnt really know much full of trash talk in generality negativity on points of view and outdated methodology that is not practical in the st centuryi have proof to my review	0
videos are a bit monotonous	3
very useful and interesting	4
too easy	1
too easy	2
the worst coursera course i have taken total waste of time the lectures are boring and have no real content the supplementary materials are good though	0
great course	4
as a software engineer i found this course a bit useless but i do understand other people dont have the same background having said that i believe it should be optional in the specialization	2
interesting first approach on communication science	4
highly recommended wonderful course and good content but a bit slow could have been faster	2
this course totally reminds me of some courses back in college unorganized material and the assignments are unrelated to the tutorial the assignments themselves seem to be very helpful but the tutorials did no help of achieving these assignmentsi had a hard time following the instructor despite that ive completed all the certificate for python from university of michigan im aware of my background of python is still not strong enough so i thought its probably just me not able to learn it fast enoughbut then i watched the tutorial about sql as a data architect  etl developer sql is something im familiar with and use it everyday and then i realized that the instructor couldnt explain a nested query well the reason i was able to understand about the sql part is because i already know	0
very well put together easy to fit into my schedule short videos make it easy to dive in and pace yourself	4
this is only theory related to the evolution of the systems how their features change over the timei personally think that it is useless because you really do not learn anything	0
poorly done	1
very addictive course	4
a solid reminder to all to be active good mooc if youre just starting out and looking for basic guidance on where to start	1
i found this course very interesting a good teach that keeps your attention along all the videos with a lot of external material papers videos web page useful to improve your knowledge thanks to all the people that have worked on this course	4
honestly didnt learn much from this course the majority of content is simply common sense and things youll know if youve spent any time on the internet in the recent years the good parts were the evaluation of different marketing channels traditional and digital and various stats on how people spend from the industry ownership of tv networks time spent per day on different media etc	1
excellent  informative and direct	3
the content is laid out very well and i found a ton of useful takeaway points thank you to all the faculty members i particularly enjoyed the assignments  they really make you think but i found the branding you  audit and insights the best exercise in this programi would definitely recommend this to friends and colleagues	3
the course is fine however its more an introduction than a course the course in itself doesnt teach much should have been the first week of subsequent courses i went through all  weeks in  week the whole course is mostly about downloading different tools and signing up for accountswhat i didnt like is that the teachers seem to be really concerned about their reputation and workload its repeated several times that you shouldnt email the teachers with questions and that online questions should be of a certain standard its understandable but its a bit patronizing i think teachers should be available for questions even if its only through the forum which they are its understandable that there are a lot of students so direct emails might overwhelm but thats just part of the job we pay for the course we should also get support when its not working for usoverall i wouldnt advise taking this course if you arent taking it as part of the specialization	1
the course addresses quite precisely and pragmatically every aspect regarding young athletes anatomical and physiological development all the information provided in the lectures is researchbased and dr brooks states clearly when she is providing information which needs further investigation or clarification the lenght of the lectures is short and these are very well organized by modules facilitating the learning process the information is almost always related to its application to young populations while the topics covered by the course represent a fair amount of the information a coach should have psychologycal and social aspects which are quite important for training young athletes are not convered in depth the assessments lack effective feedback to support the learning process given that after taking the quizzes you will only know if your answer was right or wrong missing any instruction about the course content itself and the only peerassessed piece misses a feedback section which may help to improve future writing	2
this is a best course for the beginners in the communication	4
this is a challenging course because there is a marked gap between the video lectures and the weekly assignments this course will be far more demanding of your time and willingness to fail that the data scientists toolbox if you have the time and resilience to search out support materials and frequently peruse the discussion threads you will be able to find what you need my peers with programming experience confirmed that there is too wide a gap between the content delivered in the video lectures and the demands of the coding assignments if you decide to take this course be sure to do the swirl exercises so you get a feel of how the r functions work when you grade your peers work you might notice that more than a few decided to plagiarize code from othersthe videos need to be redone effective instructors know that students learn by seeing examples not by listening to broad descriptions of what a function can do	1
this course seemed to me the most uninteresting course the content though important was not taught in a way to engage the student the professor basically read everything i could have easily done with slides than a lecture hopefully this course can be revised to make it more exciting interesting and engaging	1
you have to pay to take the the tests you might as well watch videos on youtube or better yet get on khan academy i did like the instructor even though he takes a while to warm up hes really good at showing the big picture connections of why things happened	2
practical and helpful guidance	3
new format makes it impossible to watch offline	0
whats the point of online education if one can only access the assignments if him has purchased the course with no access to assignments how could one evaluating his efficient of study	0
to much theory	1
the preceding courses were interesting and helpful this capstone project lacked substance the project did not allow itself to apply many of the concepts learned throughout the course its almost exclusively about customer analytics i would not be surprised if yahoo worked with wharton and coursera to launch this course in order to crowdsource ideas on how to turn around the company	0
this class would do well to have supplemental or required readings and much more difficult quizzes i think it would be possible to have ones wisdom teeth removed and complete this course on a bingewatching spree while on pain killers that shouldnt be possible good lecturers though	1
very boring	1
very basic and superficial course apologies each time derivatives need to be used	0
it requires you to use a lot of personal information  i did not do well on a peer graded assignment because i didnt give out enough information about what my teaching level is i fail to see how it is relevant to learning the course and do not feel comfortable volunteering the amount of information many other people do	1
im unimpressed with the quality of the material and uninspired by the professors video presentations out of the dozen or more courses here that i have taken this one ranks at the bottom im not going to disenroll at this time but i have lost interest without even progressing beyond the first week maybe if i get inspired later i will try again	0
the course material is fine in fact its good however i completed the entire course in  hours whilst i have some basic programming experience i am by no means an expert there really is very very little material in this course the assignments are also very simple and automatically graded the course fees are not particularly transparent i think the course is far too expensive for the content provided all of the other reviews i have seen for this course are a single line such as i liked the course a lot or something equally vacuous and unhelpful if you are a beginner i would suggest trying python for the absolute beginner by michael dawson if you have any programming experience you might be better with a more advanced course	1
the course provides a number of very useful tips for researchers especially those whose first language is not english there are a number of useful guides for new researchers to learn how to structure phrase and approach academic writing however there are also a few shortcomings of the course some of the material is overly subjective giving rules for academic writing that are not necessarily applicable many of the assessment questions ask about issues which are either overly specific or simply incorrect this is a very small percentage but it is noticeable the pace of the videos is also slow and oddly punctuated to the point that it can be difficult to follow at times finally the course relies too heavily on academic writing for the hard sciences rather than taking a broader approach so some students may wish to keep this in mind when watching as some advice may not be applicable to their own disciplineoverall a recommended course for esl academics but could do with some improvement	2
rd project can be made little more simpler  for begineer its really difficult 	3
too easy and no characters	3
excellent course as far as content is concerned however the older coursera format was way more userfriendly also the discussion topics were not arranged appropriately as in the previous modules in this specialization pdfs of assignments would be helpful if posted	2
the instructors presentations are so irritating due to him acting in a jumpy nervous and hyperexcited manner that i could not stand watching the lectures if you dont mind that its probably not a bad course	1
very comprehensive	3
outdated unintelligibly exercises terrible lectures	0
thank you dr chuck for a great course for a good foundation on data structures in python	3
im several months into this specialization it seems to practice little of what it preaches in its design and pedagogy ive paused repeatedly because i find the whole experience needlessly clunky and frustrating and i rarely feel like ive learned much at the end of the assignments i often wonder if anyone on the ucsdcoursera side ever actually tries to complete the assignments the quiz is missing key links and the questions read as if they were written by someone whos first language is not english pretty sloppy effort	1
a lot of speaking without any sense skip it at all cost	0
not happy about course    got cancelled	0
very poor instruction and organization of topics very poor explanation of core concepts i learned more from reading other sources while taking the class than i did from the lectures	1
great course only missing piece is the working information  maths behind the models but as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning	3
if you thought you had your studying techniques nailed this course may yet prove you wronga wonderfully structured and presented course that can benefit practically anyoneif you only had time to take one course it should be this	4
very good course for beginners this course has completed satisfied my initial requirements quizzes and exercises are very include and ofcourse mr andrew is perfect at what he does	4
the last two weeks of this course held great information however the first three weeks seemed to lack focus	2
i enjoyed the other courses in this specialization but the capstone was disappointing the course was not very structured and did not draw from the other courses in a substantial way it was often difficult to see how the readings related to the projects the course could use a lot more curation and direction	0
it was great professor shiller the best teacher in my life thank you so much	4
great but with less new content than units  and 	3
demanding but rewarding i am about halfway through the course and i can already see how much ive learned	4
the course provides the right platform to folks who are newbie to python and gives meaningful information for development on raspberry pi	2
overall very useful for anyone looking to start or invest in a business can be done quickly but still had enough detail to make it useful	3
best spark scala course clear explanation thanks dr heather	4
if you are planning to learn r then go and buy a book this course is a complete scam at least dont pay any money the reasons they advertise that you need couple of hours of study per week thats a lie you have to study much more than that unless if you know a little r programming the quiz questions are totally unrelated from the lessons they teach you the basic stuff but they expect you to accomplish intermediate quizzes the instructor has no idea how to teach may be he is trying to prove something i couldnt really understand his motives if you really want to teach thats simple you do couple of extra videos and teach whatever you are asking in quizzes or tell us to read a certain material he didnt do any of them which means he either doesnt know how to teach or this specialization is a complete scam and i dont really understand what coursera is doing by the way what kind of a business model is this i was planning to enroll many specializations but now i am not going to do it so think about how much they are loosing where is the quality assurance just because one guy comes up to you and say that he teaches this and that do you believe themmy advice to you dont pay anything for this specialization and for any other course read the bad reviews first which was my mistake	0
invaluable information in every lecture	3
very good overview i did the full data science course but im a senior manager so this was nice to get some organization perspective some parts might be a challenge for some it people but if you want to manage big data projects its worth the effort	3
excellent content and overview of the field appreciated the links to journal papers as extensions to the lecture notes course is let down somewhat by lecture notes that skim the surface too much to really be useful and outright errors in quizzes and assignments that will hinder completion unless you read through every forum post to find the missing information quiz  was the worst offender	2
very bad course but i have come to the point that it is ok for the beginers	1
the lectures are fine and the book is great but the assignments have a lot of technical problems i spent most of my effort trying to solve trivial issues with the sample code and dealing with the auto grader	1
i have learned something new	3
although prof shiller is a wellknown nobel prize winner from the first several videos my study experience is not that good prof shiller seems not well prepared it would be more helpful with full use of digital blackboard when talking through the rationales behind finance	2
well while i felt really frustrated after having played all of this course videos i have first put very negative comments here for its reviewing i have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience for sure it might be that i was not of the attended audience and i still think that this course was of no interest to me  this is the reason why im still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate nevertheless this course might be of interest for some students this is definitively true so let me suggest a new title for it design and make infographics for the dummies because thats it this course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about infographics and they might enjoy it finally i shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the authorplease notice that coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses for instance just have a look to the course machine learning of one of its cofounders andrew ngmy previous comments here belowfor sure i was not the correct audience for this course but nothing useful to be learned in here karl gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done which is of only interest to him i dislike the examples he uses  violence sex illness accidents weapons war drugs  and fruits ok are these the only topics of interest to him finally it appears that the  certificate does not worth it im pleased not to have paid for it and i definitively not recommend this course waste of time if not even waste of money	0
this is a very basic course on food and nutrition i would consider the majority of the content to be common sense i would not recommend it if you already have an interest or general knowledge of nu	1
id like to give just one star rating for this course as it is very far from what i expected the course expect students to know python to know r but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data in fact lots of r task can be replaced with python so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments this course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords and how to plot graph not worth the effort of learning therefore i would not recommend this course to anyone	0
excellent course python is powerful on the web	4
please get a more enthusiastic prof	0
there are huge gaps between learning materials videos and assignments assignments are very difficult and definitely not for r beginners also assignments instruction are a little difficult to understand i wonder if the purpose of assignments is to exam our reading and understanding abilities or the skills of ri also took courses getting and cleaning data and exploratory data analysis at the same time and these two courses assignments are much easier than the course r programming writing function in r really isnt that easy especially for an r beginner who only has little knowledge of r packages and functions i really dont think this course should arrange as the second course to take in this data science course series	1
the assignment instructions werent clear and when uploading the assignment files the pages didnt render properly this also was a problem during peer review of assignments	2
a very interresting and usefull course	4
its great im learning so much about of the calculus thanks fot it	4
the course neither explains statistics properly nor teaches how to use excel effectively disappointed	0
too easy the example showed is not very academic	2
the course was great however i think it should be more video content	1
needs more clarity	1
in my opinion the final exam was weak since it was compacting the quizzes throughout the course the content could be  theory and  practice which i consider that it was more theoretical	2
ita really good course well explainedmy only observation would be that its really frustrating that you cannot submit your work just because you didnt payed for the course	3
the interactive nature of the capstone is brilliant	4
not that helpful for me	1
the course can be informative but the presentation needs some work all of the instructional videos were merely a person reading a power point presentation to the viewer the in class examples appeared to be completely hypothetical and were also read to the viewer without any video demonstration of how the presented information works in an actual classin addition the written information in the videos was confusingly organized and had not been fully edited in multiple videos there were typos in at least one video the instructors had not fully deleted the sentences from a previous version of a slide when the revised slide was presented to the viewer a word from a previous version was in the middle of the sentence in addition the previous version was obviously about a different subjecti was disappointed and continually frustrated with this course especially since the instructors required me to pay fifty dollars in order to take the module quizzes and the final assessment i have no problem paying for a good product however the professionalism displayed in the course was incredibly lacking	1
the course is for an overview of many aspects of cybersecurity there are many resources to read videos that briefly discuss concepts of the week then there are quizzes and discussions with the topic of the week doing the possibility at the student to talk about that and post his idea for assimilate concepts and reaching goals of the course this is useful also for discuss with other students and how your ideas is viewedi think there is a very basic course in his entire length with more reading lectures at academic or professional level not for a beginner it can be adding videos with more length and indepth that in a easy way the ten domain about cybersecurity	1
classes are ok but there is no support at all no advisors to answer your questions even if you pay for the course	1
too long too diversified too much usage of technical terms heterogenous content	1
lots of mathematics and its challenging	3
this course is an excellent one that every professional must take in order to develop negotiation skils the course is presented in an easy way to understand by foreing students and the professor is an experienced professional in the matter that helps students to understand all topics using interesting real examples i suggest all people in courseras community to take advantage of this course	4
seems like the course lectures are out of order or duplicated in order for us the complete the first project it required us to view week  videos as well i wish this was notedtold to the students in the course	1
dr wentzlaff is an excellent instructor and explains the material very well homework and tests are well designed the questions are fair and they help you further your understanding of the materialonly complaint is that some of the lecture video had outofsync audio which was distractingthank you drwentzlaff and staff	3
good but need to pay to attend test	2
the stepik interactive text was just amazing  i think it is a great way to teach integrating with code academy to learn python was really helpful i spent quite a bit of time on a few challenges however arriving at the solution was very rewarding as a biologist it is a good start for first time exposure to bioinformatics and algorithms there were some concepts i had to read multiple times to understand some detailed explanations by earlier students were helpful in a few cases	3
i cannot sign up for the message board  why cant we just use courseras builtin one like other classes do also it would be a lot nicer if we didnt have to pay to even submit quizzes to get any feedback i feel like i should only have to pay to get the certificate or maybe a final project review also i dont really think all the intro to programming stuff should be in this class it seems like it should be a separate class really like explaining what a function is objective c is big enough on its own without trying to teach c too the assignments arent very inspiring either although i like how simple the first one was because it got me on my computer trying to do it the first day	2
welli learnt a lot not only in cooking mealbut also in getting nutrition in healthy way	3
its a very basic introduction would be nice to have the option to skip it for more advanced studentsalso the recorded lectures are really quite so you have to turn up the speaker a lot	2
great course very helpful and good materials provided for study recommend it	4
it was a very good course which provided a thorough platform for launching and up scaling the coaching conversation skills	4
not very substantive seems to be a marketing ploy for those onscreen more than to be anything of use to its audience	1
the content is useful but too verbose	2
if i wasnt already familiar with statistics i would find the lectures and course book difficult to follow if future revisions to the course are made consider including a cheat sheet with the notation parameter abbreviations used etc it would also be helpful to rewrite or at least include a reference back to the equation being used in the example calculations instead of immediately filling numbers in	1
i miss practical exercises that can be used to prepare the quiz	2
the course is very difficult to comprehendmoreover the examplanations given ar not concise and brief	0
while the material is relevant the exercises required too much specific knowledge that was not discussed in lecture for an experienced programmer most of the exercises were easy but i admit i had to look ahead on two of the projects because the instructions were too lacking the final project was too open ended and made me not want to finish this courseoverall i would not recommend this course	1
course is good but mentor grading needs to be a bit sorted as in they required almost  additional weeks to grade one assignment in total that is  month to grade an assignment so that needs to be taken care of	2
very good faculty good practical examples	4
good lecture and educationalextremely bad thing that is not offered and for freesame bad is that they are not try to explain more for students with less tech skillsin any case i am happy with the course and i will continue with the specialization but regardless my decision to continue my very fair rate will stay low especially for the fact that they didnt offer the course and for free	2
very little information for the cost i was done with the whole course in a few hours the review in the next course covered most of the same things it certainly wasnt worth the price	1
for me personally way to complex and brain rather than output focused	1
interresting but too easy to understand not much details very easy course but you wont learn a lot	1
nice course though much of the content is relatively basic and only qualitative for a professional might be good for a new student wouldnt recommend following all the advice eg on topics such as debt but its anyway interesting to have the perspective and it definitely makes very interesting points	2
i got a lot of knowledge from this course and i will continue learning more about guitar  and very thanks to tutor	4
good course	3
base coursera	2
good course can be better in terms of information and assignments	2
no material to read javascript is way more than just  hours even for a jump startthis course needs more material and more practice	1
more clear examples needed to make concepts clear	1
way too easy assignments only good for people who never did any kind of programming for the rest its not worth the money	0
great and very useful to understand the dynamics of the world and so being more able to influence it	4
i posted this review in a blog httpsguhyasamajacenterwordpresscomreviewofthefreecourseratibetanbuddhistmeditationandthemodernworldlesservehiclecoursegivenbyuva much of the courseware was outstanding many of the videos were so poorly done boring that i couldnt watch them i do not watch people read prepared text in a video ever from the blog i recently took the free coursera course tibetan buddhist meditation and the modern world httpswwwcourseraorglearnbuddhistmeditation from the course catalog  tibetan buddhist meditation and the modern world explores the immense variety of meditation practices past and present we present their histories their philosophical underpinnings their transformations in the modern global world and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course note in the class overview it is noted that the term lesser vehicle is perjorative but they use it anyway there are many free reasons to take this free lesser vehicle course the first of four  an awesome wonderful hourlong interview with sharon salzberg one of the founders of the insight meditation society what an awesome lady i was not aware that she is also a dzogchen student did i mention it was free worth signing up for the course just to skip to week  to watch this interview  guided meditations by dr anne klein and anam thubten very very very nice free its all free  the science of mindfulness against the background of the scientific study of meditation videos with dr clifford saron neuroscientist his videos start in week  and continue through week  in building a basis for understanding the scientific research on meditation he and the course demonstrates what can and cannot presently be scientifically proven about meditation one excellent example two trained pianists were told to learn a complicated piece of music one with the piano and the other only in his imagination after  weeks i think of practice their brains mri patterns exhibited almost the exact same changes dr saron noted that the results are not definitive but still may have implications for the compassionbodhicitta meditations we do an interview on buddhist modernism with david mcmahan very much academicoriented one statement in particular struck me since the more i think about it the more i think it might be true the buddhist tantra teachings are not accepted nor are they popular in the west for all the buddhist monastics that visit the usa and the west to grab donations and go back to their home countries few of them are sticking around to teach complete tantra classes the few that do and do it well are having a hard time making ends meet thats just my opinion i guessthere are also short  minute interviews with khenpo tsultrim lodro a short snapshot of the tibetan take on the weeks particular subject which was often better to me than the minlong talking head version  and ven tsoknyi rinpoche how does buddhism change in a new culture and benefits and dangers of secularing buddhism the tb rebuttal as it were he did note that motivation is the key bad agenda  bad results good motivation will cause good resultshave i noted the course is free so you can take the course and the following courses without doing any of the assignmentsquizzes watch or download any video or transcript to your hearts content whenever you wish in any order you wish that assumes the courses are not taken offline at a future date further in the course description is a blurb that may point to at least  future courses in mahāyāna vajrayāna and a fourth vehicle which is explicit in many tibetan materials though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions  we will thus term it as the natural vehicle or post tantra if the quality of guided meditations gm in following classes are even half the quality of this courses gms then thats all the reason i need to continue the future classes toocourse gotchas that said other shoe dropping here the other half of the course was videos of people reading their prepared academic papers in monotone or semimonotone voices transcripts are available i figure i can read a paper in  of the time someone else reads it to me in a video ugh however they would probably need the voice of morgan freeman james earl jones b cumberbatch or james spader to keep me awake to be fair the content is golden although the papers seems to be geared to the academic community rather than the student community books and videos on these subjects are all over amazon youtube fpmt dharmadocumentaries etc the sharon salzberg ss in her interview brought up an excellent point she noted that she and a noted clinical psychology cp scientist researcher whose name i have forgotten were at a conference where the issue on the table was that someone was having trouble with loving kindness meditation as a first meditation class ss noted that she would instantly recommend the student change to calm abiding meditation whereas the cp could not change that students meditation technique to another technique such as calm abiding as her research findings would then be invalid similarly many of the nonbuddhist guided meditations that i viewed in this course felt like a physical education or how to class do this do that it did not feel as though they lived the material just taught it whereas it was patently obvious dr klein  anam thubten were definitely walking the walk so to speak so were able to speak from the heartinterviews i did not watch that may be of great interest to others include meditation in the school system by tish jennings meditation in the business community an interview with david mick the burmese meditation tradition in an interview with erik braun the mbsr meditation based stress reduction with susan bauerwu and meditation in the legal community with rhonda mageeand all that is just the first course many of its failings may just be my karmic opinions the course is worth checking out and watchingreadingmeditating on those parts that interest you in that respect the breadth of the course content is quite nice and so well done grade b	2
content is very basic i believe this can be useful for school graduates but if you have at least a couple years of handson experience you shouldnt find anything new	0
very interesting and useful course for consumer behavior and marketing area	4
very simple very slow for someone with programming experience it is a drug for someone new to programing i am thinking my son not very captivating	0
very basic course i was able to complete the  weeks on content in a weekend i would recommend skipping this module and moving directly to the r programming course	1
very interesting topic and good presentation i took the noncredit option and this was the first course ive taken at coursera including duke that did not allow me to get answers to quizzes i wanted to take so i stopped taking them and feel i learned less in lesson  i think where an inlesson quiz was offered that asked me to choose between a b c or d the visual disappeared so that i was hindered when presented with the questions to answer a typo its vs its i noticed in a later lesson graphic maybe lesson  somewhere anyway thanks for the opportunity to learn about my brain and space	2
i think the last project was very badly positioned and explained first the coursera is using cloudera vm but if you execute and run the cloudera express to set the cloundera environment up the coursea exercises do not run there should be a warning if you do then the simplest jupyter exercise it fails  this took me about  hours to figure outthen for the final project technically to succeed you must miss country names in all lower case and you cannot match with countries with a space eg cape verdi and if you try to take any of this into account you do not get the same numbers to pass the test there needs to be some warning on how to interpret and manage the files so that you get the same numbers being asked for in the test again this too me about  hours to resolve both resolutions only because another colleague is doing the same course and we problem solved together this is an awful exercise in frustration due to incomplete details not a learning exercise just awful	0
the course is well structured and remains focused on the topic on hand it is easy to follow kevins thought but the discussion is quite superficial no concrete numbers and examples are worked through in the discussion it would have strengthened the course if the discussion went stepbystep through a balance sheet of one of the companies featured in the course	2
very personable instructor	3
need english version please	0
need allot of improvement	2
i found much of this material wasnt as applicable to excel analysis as hoped and didnt cover many of the analysis tools	1
a very good course need time to be completed it should continue on and lectures should be available every time regarless of end of quizez or assignments	4
professor is very detailed and clear in every lecture i would highly recommend this class to my peers	3
i enrolled in this course hoping to find a balanced perspective about historical foundations for religions and other philosophies it did include a good amount of interesting material around different systems but there were a couple of key things that made me lose interest in the course at around week  out of first i felt that the instructor talks about how he wants people to learn to think for themselves yet i also felt that he himself preaches much of the evidence in his lectures is delivered as an anecdote which might appeal to some eg i could see that happening to me and probably made the course more entertaining but didnt do it for me i felt that the wade reading in contrast was balanced cited other sources and pulled in a variety of perspectives but when i listened to the lectures i felt that professor ogilvie had a tendency to state points and expect people to believe themsecond on a related note  this course was not shaped for the online medium i understand that its cheaper and easier for universities to just use recordings of live lectures but that meant that the lectures contained quite a bit of anecdotal rambling eg going off on a tangent on how you should never take charge of somebody elses soul another smaller beef i have with the presentation of the course is that when he had students who were raised under different religions come up and speak their beliefs it took a long time to demonstrate a fairly simple idea  despite people ascribing to the same label the same religion they can have in fact been taught very different things in a live university class having students speak can work because the evidence is being presented by one of you you being the students and has the added benefit of building community in the class but in an online class i didnt feel that kinship at allill make a disclaimer that much of this review is about how i personally felt about the course and about how it wasnt right for me some of what i didnt like others may like but overall despite being initially interested in the topic and why people believe what they do i didnt feel that the material was delivered in a way that captured my continued interest	1
assignments were good practice but otherwise lectures were very thin	3
for a course with the name pro tool basics i was expecting some specific knowledge about this particular software but what the course really teaches is basic music production things samples synthesizers how to create tracks how to record audio compressors eqs etcas i am already a music producer using logic pro i was hoping to learn more about the software itself and its differences in comparison with other daws in the market so i was a little bit disappointed in the end	1
barely any contents in the course only a few minutes of lectures no quizzes and poorly constructed assignments that waste a lot of time weeks  and  have the worst material ive seen in all the courses ive taken until today	0
this course is a brilliant succinct and scientific illustration of the proverb  the learning period for human is actually from cradle to gravei have just completed this amazing course and i highly recommend this course to each and every human being who is willing to learn the most wonderful thing about this course is it makes you confident of the learning journey by familiarizing you with the hiccups of the journey and also the necessary ammunition to overcome those  i a career banker for  years and mother of two sort of gave up the idea of formal educationonline degree mostly due to time constraint after doing this course i figured that time is not a constraint the real constraint was my attitude ill remain grateful to barb tery and the whole team forever i am simply overwhelmed	4
i appreciate the fact that this course doesnt go into the fine detail on how to code everything i believe there is still more information on the coding and data management practices that could be included in the course content in addition to that i feel the course could use the following adjustments to make it better  have python students grade other python students and sas students grade other sas students while it is nice to get exposure to another language it is more than enough to learn one at a time  add quizes andor other well formed questions that are graded automatically not peer graded to help enforce the concepts being taught  make the assignment instructionsexpectations more clear i feel there are times when the grading criteria dont exactly match the requested assignment while people follow the spirit of the assignment the grading questions may ask for slightly different or additional items  certain aspects of statistical analysis are glossed over and should be covered in more depth in the training videos while i like the short videos for brevity i would prefer to watch  minutes more content and really feel like the material was well covered	2
the professor knows a lot but it could be a more deep course rather than just a introduction	2
this module is just enough material for  or  lectures with how to get started notes	1
need to explain more topics	2
quite repetitious in covering basic graphing and very shallow in regards of clustering svd and pca	1
i think the course while well laid out contentwise is poorly executed im thankful i audited the course i would have been upset had i paid for it still even the free access permits you to use all of the materials minus the major graded assignments i struggled getting any styling to work with my css files that was provided by the teacher in conjunction with my bootstrap i was unable to replicate what he presented throughout the project figuring it out on my own afterthefact as he would jump ahead in sections while verbally not visually detailing what he would be doing next i was lost for a while when i managed to correct where hed left me in the dark i found that my class assignments failed to override the bootstrap defaults i didnt get much help when i asked if he had altered the bs files or changed his specificity in order to get them to work overall  id give the class a c i did learn a few things that filled in the gaps with responsive websites but the tutorials were ultimately not very helpful	1
lectures were clear for the most part and the homeworks were fun and instructive material on dynamic programming might have been clearer also notes and references to texts would have been helpful thanks for putting together a great course	3
i really like the crowd sourcing part thank you for the great class i have learned a lotthis is my th one completed in this serial looking forward to the next one	4
i just do not feel a connection with this professor  he is constantly plugging his book and the website the content is just not engaging	0
as a career dieter who is constantly reading about causes of obesity i cant say i learned anything too earthshattering however the research discussed does support what i have learned from listening to the podcasts from the institute for the psychology of eating	1
this course is good for those people who has never program in python but for experience people there is nothing new in this coursei would really appreciate if the target audience is mentioned in a course it would be really helpful what a person would achieve after completion of a course 	2
a quick short course to get familiar with the hardware and very basic concepts of embedded systems like debugging uart and serial communication	3
lost after nd week i really liked the python for everyone course so i thought i would like this one as well but it was not done to the same standard i will find another way to learn ruby	1
the quality of videos is not good there is some absurd voice in between also the course for week  has information related to finance which is beyond understanding levels of a person with no financial background	0
wasnt great i didnt find the tests great	1
it is a great course with a lot of useful information it helps to understand the basic language teaching principles and how to avoid things like teaching burnout or loss of motivation	4
very nice tricks and insight to better manage your time and getting things donegood course achievable and worth the time spentthanksmassimiliano	3
its ok reading the top three books on time management would take less time and provide far more insight and inspiration	1
its too overview with not enough details as for me but is usefull at all	3
i did not like this course it is a course for those who are already involved into the topic not newbies very general short and sloppy explanations and a lot of practical assignments for peer evaluation i had a lot of experience in classical music but i was puzzled with what goes on in this course after having completed some other jazz courses i realized that i had no chances to learn anything here since the theory is not explained sufficiently the title of the course is misleading it rather should be called a master class on jazz improvisation	1
cant wait to rate this course i hope i could give  start but to show respect i rated it  its just because i personally dont like the instructor and the way he talks which could ruin the course i truly hope we could have another instructor in the following courses or the whole specialization would be ruined and so would my interest in database	1
difficult fast peaced and not well explained requires a lot of work	1
great intro to unity	4
very borring and too simple	1
only one week not much depth	0
consisted of relatively easytoapply methods very insightful course about learning methods	4
it gives a well based numeric approach to sustainable development but fails to approach some subjects from an ethical point of view at some time prof sachs points out a few numeric indicators that favor economic development but when talking about reaching these numbers he offers more than debatable ways	2
i am having difficulty in understanding itthe concepts go by way too fast	2
although the content is interesting i would have liked it better had the content and the instructor been a little more engaging	0
very good for one who has no idea about machine learning  but i dont like dato	3
good to build python basic data the concept clear	2
i am giving  star to this mooc because giving  is not an optionthe savoir relier protocol might be efficient when taught face to face in a classroom but as a mooc it is a massive waste of time and money i paid for the capstone project and im feeling robbedi learnt absolutely nothingthis mooc is a major disappointment from a school such as hec	0
i think that  this course need to add more keys critical important point in each lesson by keywords on videos and examples how to use these skill on nature life	2
so many better options out there to learn to code the videos on this course had me so confused that i eventually gave up and went to another website to learn what i was supposed to be learning here asked a question on the forum that another student was also having a problem and nobody answered mevery very boring try somewhere else	0
an good introduction to python geared towards people without programming experienceif you already have a good programming experience the only interesting thing of interest will be the syntax but thats just a fraction of the videos time you will probably start skipping forward on the basic ideas of how computers work and lessons will take just the time to listen to the videos and you probably will be able to finish a couple of lessons in one evening instead of a weeki really appreciated the extra videos that give some background on the history behind programmingat the end of this course you will have a basic idea of how a computer works and how you can instruct it to do still very basic things	3
great intro course started off a little slow but found the final assignment relatively challenging had some prior python background and was able to finish this course in  weeks moving on to the next course in the sequence	3
i would have liked to put  stars this topic is so important and relevant to big data after week  hands on part it became obvious we will not see how to implement or interpret the more abstract graph concepts presented in week  that was very disappointingmoreover the structure of the course is not as good as the other module i dont understand the lack of balance between theory and hands on not enough hands on to reflect the theory parton a constructive note i would replace some of the theoretical concepts of week  with additional information on how to link a graph database to machine learning or i would add more hands on exercise to help using those more complex concepts and learn how to interpret them	2
poorly executed lost my interest very quickly i thought that this course was going to be as enjoyable as dr chucks python for everyone given that both instructors are from the same institution and both courses belong to similarly named specializations that is for everyone but i ended up disappointed my suggestion for the instructor redo your lecture slides or point out to all of the errors in the slides it is not acceptable for you to just say that they contain errors and not point out where all of the errors in the slides are you only pointed out to one error in the slides by the way also i personally believe that it would have been much more interesting if you had not read off a screen for your lectures try speaking off the top of your head	0
the course is basic for introducing the html which suit for absolute beginner	3
pure information a lot of w	0
professor is difficult to follow often repeating himself and adds fluff that can often be a waste of time	1
this course has given me a basic knowledge of different tools and statistical techniques that data scientist use to play with data	3
audio was difficult to hear at times	1
i dont like pay to submit courses	1
absolutely useless course	0
this was an informative class as a newbie to the coursera community i wanted to take a course that would expand my knowledge of art and culture while fitting within my hectic work and family schedule photography is something i engage in almost daily with my iphone so i took a chance and was not disappointed sarah meister has curated a wonderful assortment of photographer artists that typify the historical and aesthetic advances in photography the articles videos and slideshows were well constructed around the theme of each module the articles would benefit from including some of the images discussed this was not a major problem as i was able to google most of them the videos were interesting and of sufficient length not to strain my attention the slideshows were my favored documents due to the inclusion of images and explanatory text i did find it frustrating that some of the answers to the quiz assignments could not be found in the required reading videos or slideshows as an educator i can certainly understand wanting students to think critically but some of the questions were misleading unanswerable based on the content or appeared unrelated many of the items did not assess my understanding of the information so much as how closely i read for specific quotes or other esoteric content this is further evidenced by the posts in the forums requesting guidance about certain items overall the course is worth the effort and time if you are interested in the history of photography and its most notable practitioners	2
about the professor and his explanations this course was excellent	4
course material is finebut the instructor isnt the most inspiring the course feels like the instructor is just reading off the presentationsoverall just an average course	1
simple practical and crisp	3
great course for beginners to get the basics of web development html css and javascript	4
its not bad but its not great eitherthe teachers passion for music may overcloud his jugment	2
very inspiring build confidence and interet	4
it was easy to complete the course but i have failed to implement its suggestions i think i will have a better idea of what to do once i actually follow the techniques	2
too much theory not enough practical exercises and too few examples of how the algorithms work	1
this course is a little too deep into programming and a little light on learning the basics of r i would recommend splitting out the more advanced programming concepts in this course and offering them in a course near the end of the specializationthis course should be higher level and give the user a wider view of r currently this course seems to assume significant knowledge of r or programming in general making it not a good early course in the specialization	1
great user friendly tools but audio did not function appropriately	3
great introduction to scraping information from internet sources and turning complicated data into something that can be visualized and processed	4
lets learn resposinve web basic	4
the entire course was not paced well the capstone had as much work each week as the other courses had in the entire  week course to make it worse for me the capstone came up at the end of the year when teachers are overloaded already i ended up having to roll over to the next session  way through work should have been better spread out i also do not like that you get no real teacher evaluation in a capstone meaning a student could take a full  courses over a year and then fail when the teachers finally look at all the work in the second capstone	0
not enough depth put another way not a cs course	2
a pretty mathheavy class but it is very rewarding in terms of understanding fourier analysis and dsp very well organized overall	4
what in stalins name is tail that wags the dog	0
aside from a new interesting ideas from a jfk speech and john dewey i found this course to be stretched pretty thin i think this class would have been effective as a  or  week course instead of  weeks also it was unclear why the focus was on classical music since so many examples come from other artforms eg ai wei wei and im sure the discussions would be richer if they considered popular music as well	1
the course is really helpful	3
good angular exercises but i think that testing should get its own segment becomes a bit lengthy with  min videos and only scraping the surface on the subject	3
wow awful presentation but great instructor i expected much more than this but leveraging employer brand is not compelete 	0
the final module is vague  but the course is nice as a whole	2
i was somewhat disappointed with the content of this course it seems shallow and disintegrated to me its difficult to say that this course provides some practical knowledge	0
this is not a beginners course there is not enough coverage of fundamental programming concepts and too much playing around with complex application concepts such as steganography simple image manipulation is a good way to teach programming concepts teaching bit arithmetic in a first programming course is not also there are many errors in the videos that should be corrected and finally this course is advertised as requiring  hours per week what a huge underestimate i have been programming professionally since  other than week  every week requires closer to  hours at least stop advertising this as a beginning course or restructure it such that it is more appropriate for beginners	0
my experience with teradata has been awful connection issues latency time outs what should have taken  minutes took nearly two hours because of the load times for datasets no clock or indication of progression for the queries	0
not recommend very basic and videos are only    minutes	0
amazing course thank you charles severance i really enjoyed it	4
this course introduces many concepts on iot i was able to learn interesting technologies and concepts this course gives a basic end to end picture involving communication with devices and cloud platform using different technologies	4
the emphasis on methods rather than specific tools makes the course more resistant to the continuous changes in technology the stage is set well and there are practical implementations still its disappointing to see that errors from previous rounds have not been corrected	2
the course was very superficial mostly with tips and hintsits good to be aware that the option for performing the quizes and tasks were unavailable making it hard to evaluate the experience of the course fully	1
interesting course but definitely not for beginners with a designer background i could never accomplish this course i really hope penn could offer course in such topic for beginners	1
the course touches the topic very lightly there are transitioning economies around the globe in dire need of start ups and the overall entrepreneurship spirit of silicon valley i wish the course had provided deeper knowledge on this particular subject specially focused on the americas	1
very useful statistics course	3
i am very satisfied with this courseim not a native english speaker though it was very clear and comfortable to deal with the course and to understand the materiali feel that i gained relevant and important knowledgethe only weakness i see in this course is that its not challenging enough the requirements are a bit too low the quiz level is too easy and it can be retaken with no limit thus it feels that everyone can get the certification without putting too much effort  and that lowers the course value	3
disappointing not different from a class presentation poor in content lousy instructor	1
brilliant course	4
i love the main lecture of the statistics the subject is fun after couple lecture my mind was very clearbut most of the time im working on the statistics software name r i think it would be better if require r knowledge if not student like me will need more than weeks to get use to r i dont mean learn another software is bad idea i will always like to learn something new thats why i go mooc what i mean is r and basic statistics should be separated first r than basic statistic or first basic statistic than ri really enjoy the class but the extra is a bit heavy for me	0
only able to audit the class no longer able to take quizzes and tests i recommend the python classes from michigan over these if you are looking to avoid paying for old material	0
very dry and uninspiredthe lecturer monotonically reads off some materialthe explanations dont usually make any sensethe quizzes are a guessing game arbitrarily connected or not to the lecture materialin retrospect a waste of my time	1
very helpful	3
interesting for usamericans or people who are interested in usamerican epidemiologics very uscentered	2
weeks  and  were not satisfactory according to me the video lectures were difficult to comprehend week  was very good	1
this course was too messy i spent  of my time to get the examples to work it would have been better if after each module all the js and html files would be given in total not just the snippets	1
i learned a lot of new things throughout this course at first my skeptical approach was well that ive seen on youtube but after st week i started realizing it gives you more  the understanding of how games made what it takes and what youre capable of when left with limited knowledge and some readytouse tools this month wasnt that easy for me and what i know for sure  if not for collegelike system and approach  i wouldve put studies away to solve life problems which would probably result in putting it away for longer	4
if this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips the capstone would be that bland chip that didnt get any saltthe introduction to the capstone promises that well build applications utilizing what weve learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper however none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities if you can download a file and take a screenshot then youve got what it takes to pass this classthe optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed unfortunately the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the classin fact the entire capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived betatest ive ever been a part of such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization	0
great exercises and assignments the course is involving	4
as someone with a very limited background in statistics i found the course jumped very quickly from basics to extremely complicated statistical modeling with all the jargon that comes with it so either the course description didnt provide enough information for a nonstatistician to realize it will get very complex or the language and explanations should have been simplifiedmore descriptive for the audience	1
not as advanced as other coursera courses this course if for participants who do not have any background in international relations and diplomacy wish they would have made it more advanced	1
there are too much materials for each week for a hong kong secondary school middle school student the speed can be adjusted to a slower one so as to allow more people to catch up the course	3
nothing new to learn here this is very dull in contrast to other courses of this spec i gave up watching the videos after a while and try to pass anyway too bad this is part of this spec i wish marco or matthew taught this course too this course is very hard to follow and not interactive at all it should take the students through examples live examples the student can do too and things the student builds from scratch this does nothing like thatdont take this course if you arent after the specialisation certificate its not worth the time and efforttoo bad this spec includes this course it shouldnt be here	0
very important concepts of finance covered in very short timevery useful	4
little to no use for me should not be included in the specialization i didnt sign up for a data class	0
so far the best course available online almost research level i have never done anything uav but i am a researcher for many years i finish the material within  week not full time i assume it would be possible for average senior undergraduate student to finish with  weeks of intensive study	4
she is fluent just like reading the scripts	0
unusually short one but intensive focused on google products has opened my eyes toward gcp offerings and how they can be used within ml area as outcome you will have gcp account on hand plus bunch of ideas how to use it during  month of free trial	3
actually its rather hard to understand how javascript works if youd never learnt it before this course and all this comments like write a programm before start the quiz hold me up to ridicule because as a beginner i dont understand logic of writinghtml  css are simple so theres no problem here	1
i have just started but it looking real interesting so far	3
its good but can be better they have to give more examples about the concept	1
its a good introductory course but its very basic and i feel that i paid a lot for a very basic experience i do understand it is the first step in a full specialization but i think it can be more challenging	2
i cant pass because you dont allow me submit my assignment and asked me to subscribe although this course is paid 	0
cant understand whats going on	0
i really love it	4
great course which give many useful information	4
the course is interesting and entertaining at times though seems relatively undercooked typos in video lectures and assignment writeups are still frequent the course content is a bit rushed with some rather difficult aspects left almost unexplained definitely not for begginers as some knowledge of physics differential equations calculus matlab programming is highly recommended	2
decent introduction course however examples are very simple as well as the models that are constructed i understand being an intro course the content needs to ease people into the subjects however more realistic and reallife examples are necessary to take the material from this course and apply it	2
ive finished my specialization in python for everyone and thought this specialization would be a nice follow on the instructors are funny and try to keep it light but it certainly is not an intro level course it took me nearly  months to finish the final  projects i wont be continuing this specialization it might have been ok if they had an intro to oop that was a prereq for both of these courses	1
i love this course	4
too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know r	2
to much talk	1
very good course	4
the course is for people having advanced knowledge in embedded architecture and knowledge until rd week is perfectly alright but from th week the course changes to advanced knowledge i do not think an intermediate could easily grasp enough knowledge from the th week kindly do the needful to change it	1
a perfect place for beginners in web programming	4
poor video editing homework assignments were poorly written making it difficult to know exactly what was being graded often times i had to submit a version and redo it after i started working through the grading criteria during peer reviewdecent information covered however i felt like this was more of a course on responsive design than specifically information design	2
there isnt any test and the lectures are very boring	1
this course is excellent	4
i work seemed a little too light	2
examples have to be more clear i cant seem to get anything correct because of computers	0
very useful for learning from scratch	4
one week of this course was only marginally relevant to the subject the instructor even said as much	0
needs improvement a lot i think	2
there are courses that offer better level of details and better course materials and presentation  and also for free however this course is a besteffort course and is helpful for beginners	2
i passed every quiz doing the course across  sessions yet i cannot speak a sentence in korean apart from hello and thank you something must be wrong with my brain or how the course is designed	2
great content horrible technical support from coursera and the team that runs this program since it is clearly obvious that michael mannino just recorded the videos and is not part of the class anymore	2
this was an excellent course i could go at my pace i loved that i was in the comfort of my environment so i could pause a	3
very basic and obvious things its not really useful for anyone older than high school student	1
in this course i got new skills about the ruby on rails framework using the incredible active record orm and the action pack great videos	4
it was overall a good course for a beginner but too much theoretical things are there one needs to push more on practicals	1
it provides a broad overview but materials are not very refined and the course does not provide a good structured approach to the subject at least it did not for me leaving me wondering as to what next steps could be if i wanted to explore further	0
superb experience  got to learn a lot including the basics as well as some critical concepts very lucidly	4
more indepth analysis would have been amazing	1
instructor reads lectures in monotonic voice the lectures themselves are just a series of cases of some r functions usage with no basics of why you need to clean the data or real cases with complete examples how and where to get your data and what steps you can do to make it usefulthe course has a lot of links for tutorials in r thats a plus	1
no one would take this course any more	0
excellent very good introduction especially recommended javascript	3
i completely enjoyed this course and highly recommend it dr chuck does a great job the lectures are easy to follow i liked the exercises which have a good balance between being easy enough to succeed at the same time making one to think carefully to find the solution	4
i would recommend reading the docs on the bootstraps website this course doesnt add much value to just the normal bootstrap docs	1
the course content was slightly repetitive and the information on the myersbriggs personality types can be found online it is such a pity that payment must be made to access the graded coursework preventing one from completing the course if one chooses not to pay	2
useful course for exposure to debates that animate the common law with some bits about the relationship of english and european law prebrexit its probably fair to say this course offers some experience in the elusive skill of how to think like a lawyer the legal debates might seem a bit pedantic to all but the specialist for example the course attempts to sketch in the debates about proper use of precedent with frequent reminders that the task of fully developing such debates is beyond the scope of the courseill bet some students were thinking thank goodness its beyond the scope its all clear enough and delivered pretty much exclusively in traditional lecture formattheres even a lectern each of these lessons about the legal debates outlines and develops the opposing sides but doesnt give you a whole lot of new content to be tested thus many of the quiz questions are on comprehending passages from cases statutes or commentary such quiz questions sometimes feel like those reading comprehension questions from a standardized test rather than tests of the material covered in the lesson	2
this should not be a course of its own	1
very difficult to understand and follow	0
great course and pretty easy andrew coursera and stanford  you did amazing job hope to meet you in person one day all the best	4
probably the best course in this overall very nice specialization	4
its very helpful for the people want to pick up his first language a great coursebut for the folks who have studied some other language its might be little bit too easy and not contentintensified	3
great course very practical and well designed	4
the assignment is difficult	2
it might be a great choice if you are already familiar with swift programming there is a huge gap between the week  and week  in other words during the first  weeks you will learn about just the syntax and idea of swift programming but all of a sudden you have to write a program with over  lines of codei would recommend to offer more details and more practices during the first few weeks from this course before writing a complicated program	1
nothing special no significant knowledge gained	2
ref a crash course in data science the content could be presented in a simpler way some of the presentations sounds little vague and conceptual level like an advanced math or statistics class i am wondering since this is an executive program is there a simpler and easy to grasp way to present the material the text download files ie txt document descriptions needs to be more clearer the power point downloads are excellent and are to the point	1
lot of philosophy which wasnt really related to managementbut overall a great experience i especially like the video in which he talks about thinking in new boxes real practical stuff	3
good introduction into the material its great how rating other students writeups helps you penetrate the material yourself especially since there are no right or wrong answers	3
wonderful you need a lot of motivation beacuse it is full of great content so the lazy days may come but even if you fail to finish this course it is totally worth it	4
the capstone just like the courses of the specialization are a strong illustration of the problems of higher ed	0
the part of course from prof sytch and prof derue was really interesting and important but i cannot complete this course because part of dr alexander is impossible to listen it is necessary all the time to separate useful information from enormous amount of information about her private life is it a course about private life of dr alexander or about managing talent and i am  years not she is talking with us like we are small kids and so she can keep our attention only by special voice and multiple stories her private life	1
great course maybe a little bit too basic	3
interesting course however more examples could be included	2
i found this course less engaging than the previous ones in the specialization i would have appreciated if the video lessons were focusing more on commenting case studies in many cases i had the impression that the professor was simply reading the slides	1
i recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their english	4
easier than expected much was common sense although it was well put together	2
so far this course has benefited me beyond any expectations im forever grateful for taking this course and i highly recommend it for everyone	4
a very useful and excellent	3
this is merely a starter course that gets you acquainted with the basics of ml using python i hope to see the instructors cover algorithms in greater detail in the next few courses in the specialization also they focus exclusively on datos graphlab  thats a worry i was hoping to be introduced to numpy scipy and other python libraries for ml they could have at least spent some time demonstrating why they thought graphlab was a better alternative	3
didnt get much into the managerial aspect of a data analysis instead it covered best practices for conducting a data analysis not the same thing and a little disappointment	2
the approach in this course is incorrect i think that will be a course with more concret examples but is a course with a lot of teory that is not applied	1
very well put together and engaging for budding project managers providing the key to the pmbok was very helpful as i begin to navigate the process toward pmp and project management in a large organization	4
very good introduction into the practical aspects of machine learning its also great that students can work with a free matlab version for the duration of the course	3
i enjoyed this course it was challenging and well thought out i am confident that i will be able to apply the concepts learned to my work kudos	4
this course should retrieved from coursera it is plenty of mistakes one of the quiz is repeated questions do not have relation with lectures	0
the grader doesnt have test cases anyone can fool the grader easily	3
not so comfortable with using excel	2
learning how to learn has given me more insights on how our brain functions by understanding these basic concepts i have learnt tips on how to make a difference in studying and mastering new things retaining information as well as to build confidence in my learning journey it is a great course for all learners	4
cant be completed without payment	2
rather theoretical introduction to the basics of an interesting subject regretfully examples and assignments are frequently overly complex in areas which are unrelated to the subject in addition people who work with software development should expect to look further if they aim to add to their toolbox	0
the least comprehensive course i ever took it needs very good prerequisite about computer vision and the demostration was very poor	0
very good course for the beginner	4
peer grading worked well good explanations	3
it was excellent	4
no useful info for me	1
really very good 	4
this is a great course for those who study not for not studying shows many good and practising methods for being better learner and improving yourself psychologically sometimes it is better be psychologically efficiented than educationally i graded  from five only because of this is not mathematical course nevertheless i am appreciated team who made this course thank you and good luck  	3
unable to do assignment wo today is last date	0
i was a little lost during projects there no extensive videos for languages but on the other hand there was good materials and refereed links that could help	2
there were mistakes in the quizzes	2
the tests are a little too easy	3
it could be easily compressed in a twoweeks coursesometimes interviews are too long for what they need to explain	2
this good course but i have none of those cards as i can do to pay the course	3
too little substance though i do expect the rest of the series to be good as i take this as a setup course and my expectations for those are high having said that perhaps it would be wise to charge less for this initial course or even offer it for free	2
too much surface not enough depth	0
the course was very shallow as if teaching english literature	0
this course need a serious reworkfor the moment i finished it biggest problem was very unclear grading of programming assignments and lack of learning materials	0
the course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting todaybeing a basic course it is very easy to follow and finish quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesnt make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocatingthe videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors spark white and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it which was downright infuriatingit still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism but needs serious improvement	2
great course	4
this course does go over some of the basics of graphic design but i expected it to be a lot more rigorous the assignments are incredibly simple and i think that there should be no optional assignments in the class the reason im taking this class is because i have a hard time motivating myself to learn on my own so i need something that will really push me i only spent about an hour a week completing this course and i believe that you cant learn something by only spending an hour a week on it also whats the point of having mentors if they dont engage with you i know i could have contacted them if i had a question but i didnt because it was so easy i wouldnt mind getting feedback from a professional graphic designer though if theyre available also seeing how many students misinterpret the assignments it makes me nervous that they are the ones grading mine	1
i need more practical example related to mentioned theories and concepts in lectures	1
the wieos are not targeting online students the videos are long but not teaching many things the course is too gneral	0
a class on modern american poetry and ezra pound was only treated secondarily crazyas well much of my time on recommended reading was spent looking for the poetry why are there no links to the poetry we are learning about	2
i thought this course would teach art appreciationbut seems geared towards teachers	0
amazing course very helpful and clarifying about productivity changing and learning	4
the theory explained and the exercises are not at the same level	0
loving the course short and scientific videos with very useful information conducted by lovely lecturers what more could one possibly ask for	4
minimal video efforts not enough content and long readings definetly not a good course to get a verified certificate	0
i didnt learn much new concepts or working tips that i didnt know before taking this course	1
great course to start a happier life	4
concepts are explained in clear and efficient manner however more emphasis should be laid on problem solving	3
instructor is clearly reading off of cards or a prompter that doesnt face the camera so hes constantly not looking at you which is frustrating the feeling of each lesson being so scripted takes away from the feeling of a professor teaching material with which he is comfortable comparing this to uc san diego course videos is like night and day and really makes you realize the importance of quality productionnatural flow of teaching	0
its a very good course perhaps the in the practice code before jumping into the problems they can provide a couple of simple examplesquestions such that the main ideas are learnt	3
wonderful tools were taught good course the presentation of the tools was appropriate to get started quickly with these tools thank you instructors	4
good for novice developers trying to learn java not good for experienced developers trying to learn java	2
it was a good course but it doesnt worth the money paying  is just too much for this elementary course	1
there was a lot of questions on the tests that were never covered in the videos	1
it is best to have a strong statistical background before taking this course lots of statistical calculations and procedures if you dont have a strong background in statistics  there is a good chance you will get lost at some point in the course there is no questions that the instructor of this course is an accomplished mathematician i just found it hard to follow his lectures as he got deeper into various statistical aspects of the course	1
the best course i have taken so far in machine learning lots of insight on algos their resemblance their limitations when to use them or not and some rough intuition to present them	4
the professor certainly knows a lot about this subject but his delivery is stiff and dry if he shared his passion for the subject with us it would be more enjoyable on the plus side i admire how he shares the greek language with us so capably and combines art with his lectures	1
it gives you another perspective of your brain that youve never imagined recomended	4
good for an introduction class	3
i found this course well strucutured	4
it was a great course thank you so much	4
thorough introduction to regression the assignments are demanding and the teachers very engaging it would be nice if a wider range of applications and examples were presented	4
the software video tutorials need to be updated for example mac users need to use different programs which raises all sorts of different questions on where to go and where to find what dr t is working with for the lesson  second this is for beginners we would like to know why we are typing certain commands and what they do  he has a good attitude but explanations need to be a little more detailed on what things are what they do and why we are using them for any mac user you will be better off using parallels to install windows and use this lessons with the programs he is working on like visual basic which is only for windows 	1
the content of this course is interesting i liked the examples and the material gave an interesting overview of different aspects of machine learning from that perspective the course is as advertised but where this course goes wrong is value for money  it is very superficial and not worth what is chargedas noted by others this is not a course for learning so much as an advertisement for the instructors own pay software and their other coursera courses im not against that per say if it was entirely free but charging for an advertisement is ridiculous in my case i thankfully started with the free model so i didnt lose out but i could see others being dissapointed i strongly recommend starting the material with a free signup and only pay if you really want the extra gradingmy other main problem was with the pace and detail in the course i would have liked more detail but i recognize this was intended to be a high level view so ill live with that level of detail the material covered however does not need  weeks worth of lectures this course could be  as long cover the same material and be a much better courseother small problems include some poorly edit videos there are a lot of examples of simple stumbling in the videos that should have meant they do another take very short videos maybe a person preference but the number of  minute videos here is annoying especially when theres a second standard video at the start and end of all videos all in all theres just a lot of wasted timewhen signing up for this course i was really excited for the entire specialization  now not so much ill probably try the second course in the series for free to start to see if things improve but ironically this advertisement video has if anything turned me off their other products	1
the first and the last week propose basic but selfexplaining inputs in an uninteresting manner nevertheless there are some quite good take aways out of the four courses of the specialization managing talent is the weakest	1
one of the best courses on coursera	4
woderful and useful	4
very intetesting and complete would love a follow up didnt give  stars just because i think the course could have been even more specific about young readers target audience thank you	3
interesting course but lacks details and practical knowledge	2
presentation is poor not very engaging	2
this was a nice closure to the specialization but a little too complicated to the point where there were almost no students around to get feedback from or give to	3
interesting and usefull course	4
very poor content on java script if you just started js do not take this course it will be too hard	1
an unexpectedly disappointing and in fact downright awful course the lectures waste a good share of time as in places they barely scratch the surface of what is further required to be implemented in the assignments the assignments themselves inherit the nice modular spectest driven spirit of the first two classes however the instructions are mostly quite vague or even misleading occasionally dropping some hints which are often either not helpful or just offer to copypaste a quarter page of code the tasks are very and by very i mean extremely long tedious boring to tears and to the point when you start to wonder if the authors are trolling the students how about a  yes that is fifty three pages of assignment for the d week to be fair not all of this is the task statement there is a lot of test code as well but you know even one third of  is an impressive volume for a  weeks course you get reenrolled if you fail to be fair took me  hours of pure coding time according to wakatime to finish the course i have passed tens of courses on coursera and this one is by far the worst that is taking into consideration that i would not rather call any other course of those i have taken a bad one i suggest saving time and money by buying a book on mongo and another one on rails instead i do believe though that the course is very green and certainly has to undergo some refinements and i will be happy to see future reviews shadow this one as obsolete	1
i was so excited for this course but it failed miserably i am a complete newbie i didnt know one thing about iot before engaging in this course i gave it one star due to actually learning a small something in spite of the fact the prof is extremely inarticulate the course is extremely short and vague there was no care in detail or discussion or presentation theres no forum to ask questions or to even start or engage in a discussion	0
the course could be improved by cutting the repetitive materials avoiding the timeconsuming drawing on the slides and be more precise on the wording	1
its way to easy to be a separate course it should be part of r programming	2
bad one most of the time he was only giving what is their in the course mooc   etc etc irritated	0
i like the whole experience but there are some gaps between sessions and weekly projects i think this course can be improved with adding small tests between each session and providing several exercises as complimentary material for understanding many topics i watch many other videos on youtube till i grasp the concept	2
not enough implication from the instructors in the course students are left alone with the material without any answers to there questions on the coursepeer review process subject to personal interpretation and leading to frustration for the studentsthats quite unfortunate as this provides a bad experience whereas the course might have been good without that	1
really great things taught in this course are useful	4
abstract and uninformative stories about some photographersbut not about the profession of the photographer or the technical side of the workthank you for the opportunity to get acquainted with the course	1
this course was difficult to follow and the free trials offered seemed forced upon us lexalytics isnt available for a mac so i couldnt even use it i think this portion of the specialization would be much better if it focused more on the value of these tools rather than trying to get us to install them it might be useful for some especially those in bc or willing to play around with the tech but it was a waste of time for me i would have preferred to just take a look at some proven case studies linked to the tools	1
this mindshift course should be on the top of your todo list if you want to broaden your passion and enhance your career personal life and learning experience	4
good context however long videos didnt catch my attention	1
a great course not too complicated for beginners it effectively got me started in learning programming	4
very very broad with no real depth basically a very light summary of what cybersecurity is you could watch all of the videos in  min probably the real course comes from the reading and peer discussions	1
its very boring just someone reading off slides one could read from a book instead no examples or explanation to the information on the slides	0
the title of this course is paradoxes of war one of the paradoxes is how little paradox there is in war after reviewing and reflecting on the lectures and the reading materials	0
content could have been boiled down to about  lectures most of it was common sense the high level over view of the life cycle of data analysis projects was interesting and overall this was a good introduction to the field	2
this course is great if you listen to the advice from this course take notes and actively implementing this advice as you go along it will become much easier for you to notice results very quickly this course has helped me change my mindset towards learning and studying  i noticed my old ways werent working as well for me and learning this course helped me not only becoming aware of the techniques one can use to master their leaning but also allowing me with a plethora of different learning methods to experiment with and see which one works for me i highly recommend this course if you want to continue to learn in life and get ahead much faster	4
its not on architecture for iot as name suggests its general software architecture course	0
pretty good intro you can kind of use the exact same code on each homework though so there is not as much learning going on	3
it could have been more dynamic  the interviews were boring and there wasnt enough content	1
i really enjoyed following this course thanks a lot for such a rich and pleasant content i am definetly recommending it to my friends	4
it was a great course	4
this part was good but it would have been much more informative if bit more is added	3
awesome course is interesting and engaging cheers	4
lack of information and clear direction i could have produced a more cohesive document if all of the deliverables were described from the beginning	2
omigod youre kicking this off in rstudio and teaching the whole course from this interface could you at least use a pen with ink that we can read when youre not in rthis might be the last straw for me in this specialization nothing about this subject matter is easily digestible for a designer and im okay with that im also a webjs developer so im used to intense struggles with really abstract stuffwhat i cant get over is that this is part of an interaction design specialization that teaches design concepts but whose instructors almost never practice those concepts in their pedagogy do as i say not as i do seems to be the prevailing mo the whole effort seems totally halfbaked and nowhere more so than in this coursei might not be so harsh if there werent such great examples of well designed pedagogy elsewhere in coursera and for material thats at least as dry as statistics	0
a great introductory course into the field of epidemiology covering all basic aspects of the field the educators are very well organized and the work load per weak is very manageable it is to be noted though that the exams can pose some difficulty in first two weeks as some may consider them to focus on trivia other than that a great course	3
very eay to follow and an excellent profesor	3
another very good class in this specialization	3
thought this course couldve been much more effective the content felt very random and esoteric at times especially the programming assignment on cached results i get it im a programmer at heart but this is at the margin of usefulness how about a segment on running regressions or doing some real data analysis	2
good course	3
wont teach anything to anyone with the most basic computer science background and knowledgethe most useless assignments in any coursera course ive ever seen that require no useful or any knowledge to complete	0
the lectures were too wordy and the lecturers tripped over their words too often which wouldnt have made it so difficult to listen if the lectures hadnt been so wordy there was too much focus on highlevel details of the course project and too little attention paid to technical details this rendered the lectures simplistic boring and sometimes a waste of time this felt like an introductory level course made more difficult through poor teachingalso the slick web interface was slightly difficult to navigate in comparison to other coursera courses	1
its a good course where i come across bower and css how to use the function for the ui frameworks	2
poorly designed assignment on data modeling did little to expand my knowledge on the topic which is a shame since the individual lectures were well done and very interesting the pink flamingo peerpeerreveiwed exercise needs to go	0
a good course to understand the fundamental change which is happening in the field of marketing and communications a must for beginners	4
exceptionally goodgreat experience	3
too long not enough concrete materials too much focused on us	0
the first three weeks assigments were way too easy and the answers could be found in the materialthe last assignment was very poorly described and the material was very limited in explaining oop that meant it took a lot of time figuring out what exactly was needed to complete the assignment and how to do itdisappointing after a great first course hoping the next will be better	0
one of the best course on probability i have ever taken period	4
unfortunately this course consists of the professor reading his notes very quickly with rapid listing of concepts and very little time spent explaining complex topics the quizzes emphasize the terms for various elements of the analysis rather than teaching how to work with the tools to analyze data there does not seem to be anyone monitoring the course forum and mistakes in quiz questions and questions asked on the forum are not answered or replied to by anyone i was committed to working with the course but by week  it was unfortunately impossible to absorb and there was no way to interact with anyone to get help im sure there is room for improvement on this course and i hope the instructor does work to improve with the course but currently the course is disappointing as a learning experience	0
excellent course i learned a lot but i think it should have some peer reviewed assignments like a little research on some topic so that you have to look for information and learn a lot more in the process	3
great course for beginners 	3
content needs to be updated	0
awesome however was a littler dificult to follow i think it can be betther by a step by step practices	3
its a good course by the standards of when it was made which going by the overview looks like  the lectures are based on eclipse while the video teaches how to install android studio some of the examples are not compatible with android studio and work only on eclipse being updated with the more recent material wouldve helped more having said that the teaching style is really conducive to learning for newbies its a good introduction to the world of android development	2
the instructor was great  the assignments were good and helped me learn a lot	4
pretty good overview of how to build some types of machine learning models through the caret library in r but not much in terms of the theoretical underpinnings or why one method is better than the other or where it is most suitable	3
it should be less repetitive and full of useful informations about applications	2
many question in the quiz wasnt covered in the video lectures i enrolled in this course looking for refreshing my info about the  subjects and hopefully gaining new indepth info about them but the information presented during the course was very trivial and only covered few parts about the main  subjects	1
the course material is ok the lectures are fun and interesting but to pass the course you need to submit an assignment that is subjected to peer review and you will need to get approval by all of your peers however the act of subscribing to a mooc alone does not make people suited to review other peoples work	2
this course is very good it gave many new ideas to me and my students	4
its a good course and has helped me understand time management better than the motivational books ever did	3
i thoroughly enjoyed this course it was very insightful for me it gave me a more rounded understanding of what appears to be driving infrastructure investment debates as well as political and economic decisions both globally and in my own country	4
a bit boring  way too basic and i expected it to be a bit more systematic  simple and quite fragmented examples around one case could be a bit more	2
generally i like the contents of this course i particularly like that insights are provided in terms of what aspects to consider when designing a recommender system pros and cons of different approaches however im also extremely bored watching the videos because looking at the lectures reading the scripts most of the time with very slow speed is one of the quickest way to send people to sleep id hope the lectures will improve their presenting skillsanother comment is the honours track assignments should really be put into more thoughts i passed them with  credit but i didnt feel i gained a lot useful knowledge through this exercise generally it felt to me that the complexity of the implementation is much much more than needed in relation to the complexity of the problems eventually this assignment became grinding with javas verbose annoying syntax and unnecessary computations designed in lab instruction for example in the first programming assignment why if the modelprovider object already computed the entire map of ratings and the map is directly needed in the recommender object the model object only provide api to retrieve individual rating but not the entire map isnt it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map so i doubt the structural design of the program is sensible or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications also i think java is just a really outdated bulky language to work with in this kind of task it really makes the assignment experience awful	2
pretty solid course for an online format solid grader and i enjoy how you can input derived equations in the homeworks that makes it feel more brick and mortar class this beats other class approaches i have used in other platforms that use peer grading very comprehensible introduction and a satisfying course i wish the course work was a bit more challenging i know this is difficult in an online format st offering but when i compare this homework to their actual class websites for oncampus students it is obvious this online format was given the easier problems to solve	3
it is a very useful and interesting course thank you very much	4
instructor is really good giving lectures history suddenly seems full of fun and power	4
not really a course should just be week  in course 	2
i have learned many thing by attending the class which is good for helping me find a job	4
not to much of interesting but interesting	2
unable to even start it click on videos of week  and nothing happens	0
if youre a somewhat experienced programmer looking to start and hand on learn how to build apps this course is not for you	2
rather basic nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with r mostly concentrated on applications of the r caret package	3
could use more hands on coding	2
excellent course its easy but inspirational in nature	3
this course as the previous one needs some improvements first learning only relying on videos is not very effective there are no lecture slides neither consistent addtional resources to grasp seriously the materials also the way quizzes are designed is not  in my opinion very well planned the videos alone do not give consistent background to approach seriously the quizzes also  again in my opinion i didnt saw a consistent approach to the materials neither the examples given made any sense in the last video there is a mention to the business world and how to apply this savoir relier approach but in contrast the videos and examples show as examples a situation extreme with an avalanche use the hec mba program as example i simply dont see how this can relate with the business world as a consistent comparison i think you should reflect on this	1
i enjoyed the class but was frustrated when it came time to get my slidify to work on github since rpubs wasnt publishing them correctly i had to convert it to rpres which was easy thankfully in order to get my project submitted in time	3
great course	4
great course and great instructors	4
nice for basics	3
this is a really nice course it has actually help me grow in the way i write a story there are many things i am taking away key tips and suggestions one thig that could be improved in this course was the assesment noone has assesed my work becase of which my course it said to be incomplete that could change otherwise awsome	3
excellent business and financial information	3
i dont understand how come this course can get such high reviews my experience with this course is horrible first of all most quiz are poorly designed lots of mistakes for instance there are  qs in week   of them have mistakes wasted me tons of timeslectures are also difficult to follow instructors usually just give formulas without further explanation i forced myself to go through them until week  i finally give it up i feel like it is a waste of my time i need to find a better course on this topicmost coursera courses are very well designed this one is the worst i have ever experienced	0
to lock a quiz for payment is mean	0
i had many problems with the final two programming assignments with running spark in the vm and there isnt a lot of help available online	1
the pace is perfect for beginners ive done a fair amount of programming in the past but i definitely appreciate how the tutor goes through the material patiently the assignments were fairly easy for me due to my background but i thought they were challenging enough for any firsttime programmers	4
not actually much useful course but still provide some interesting information	2
i will be great if you provide learners with additional material worth to read	3
too short to get any depth of information too expensive for the content provided	0
i would have liked the class to be less theoretical with more frequent explanations linking concepts to practical applications in daily  business life in order to keep interest and motivation high and facilitate understanding and memorisation it sure would help to enter this course with a certain background of probability those memories were too ancient in my case 	1
excellent tutoring and lessons	4
it was ok but ara	1
ive been enrolled to this course for over a year already i abandoned it after the first couple of classes presented by extremely boring teachers i wouldnt say that their way to deliver the message about efficient learning is motivating	2
while the content of this course was presented in an engaging way the assessment task lacks context to then be asked to peer review others based on this is particularly disengaging	1
there are some incorrect answers in quizes and some instructions for the ssigments are qiute unclear	2
i liked this course i had a lot of interesting things to know it is good opportunity to use it in my work	4
i was quite disappointed by this course after several delays the course stated months later than originally planned the videos are badly edited and there did not seem to be a lot of content within this course	1
you cant do assignments using the lecture materials need a lot of time to finish this course	0
good course need more contents	3
course content good but labs difficult to work with as no offline unit tests were provided which made debugging painful	2
i found it to be enjoyable the teacher lectures where well understood and i also enjoyed the test i had enough information that also helped me to take down notes i have recommended few of my friends thank you all	3
nice one perfect for complete beginners	3
it was a bit repetitive in parts that was a irrelevant such as what were gonna see next mooc but not repetitive in the actual content	3
nice but not understood some topics	3
really gained some valuable knowledge on the history of strategy and the current strategy being used by the corporations	3
how to change the world is a good introductory course to create awareness about some of the most important issues of our world nowadays the lectures leaded by prof michael roth showcase interesting conversations with other experts about their attempts to make positive change in the world and the weekly assignments are a good way for students to synthesise the learning of each weekas a downside i found very little participation in the discussion forums i would have liked to discuss more about the different topics of each week also the lectures while interesting were sometimes a bit longwinded and i did not like the fact that some conversations were divided over several videosin general i have enjoyed the course and doing the assignments and also reading and reviewing my peers work i would suggest reediting the video lectures in a bit more synthesised and selfcontained pieces and perhaps to spice up the discussion forums with some initial threads by the moderatorsfinally i would like to say thanks to prof michael roth for its incredible effort in bringing together all the guest speakers and for making available this course for everyone in the worldmiguel r c	3
very nice quick  dirty introduction to different methods of machine learning thanks a lot andrew	4
this course and its related courses are rough around the edges things are not always intuitive	1
im sorry but i dont like the way this course was presented since this is about the science of happiness i would have preferred a more clinical approach	1
not as much practical as the other python courses provided in this series the coding assignment is quite easy since the code has been already written the only thing you have to do is run it	2
this course is very enjoyable and highly stimulating i intend to use the learning techniques as i journey into retirement german is a language i will learn to enhance my attendance at oktober fest  thanks loads for the information	4
badly taught	0
too much focus on databases and database operations rather than data sciencethe assignments are too difficult for a  week course	1
wonderful experience ymust try	4
this is a great course that is very informative it brought many performers to my attention that i had not heard of before or that i had not appreciated before and has enriched my appreciation of music the course focuses mainly on the history and development of rock music rather than the technical side of the music itself it is a pity that the course itself only discusses the music but does not feature the music itself i suggest that you keep a streaming service such as spotify or deezer open in a separate window on your browser so you can pause the lectures and listen to the music as you go along	3
great course learned a lotwould have liked more practical exercises rather than premade scripts that we edit	3
an awesome experience with the team a big thank you	4
this course was little more than a haphazard ambling preview of a tiny bit of swift there was some useful content in the class but the organization was poor and there was almost no evidence of course design or use of the teaching techniques i expected to see from a major university the best section of the course was week  where they syntax of objectivec and swift were superficially compared that section did give some clear opinions on why swift should be chosen over objectivec for new development the other sections just contained too many confusing unrehearsed diversions into esoteric topics to be of much use i ended getting more out of the apple documentation on swift than i did from this classhowever the instructors have received ample feedback of this nature and they do seem genuinely concerned with improving the course assuming that they will make major improvements for the next round and noting that courseras infrastructure is excellent dont be scared to take the class the email reminders from coursera about assignments etc kept me on track and kept me in the class	1
just three stars for the topic chosen grainger a bit to complicated and sometimes not straitforwarded tasks	2
great beginning to data science	3
has good collection of resources for improvement of communication skills	2
really good	3
this was extremely useful it contains much needed structure you can apply this to anything you want to accomplish and it will get you there	4
very well structured course i would really appreciate if there are more video lectures for someone like who is not from cs background selfstudy topics can get really difficultapart from that loved it	3
more difficult than part a but also more rewarding thanks prof dan	4
i was able to grasp the overview of the course the instructions are delivered well and the flow seems in order however my lack of background with the topic discussed cause me to stop watching everything plus i cant do the said assignment because i am a beginning on this topic it seems this is not a course for me to rate based on content however i will rate it in terms of the aesthetic organization or structure of the slides the organization of the content of the slides needs to be properly organized long paragraphs are a pain to read further when comparing two concepts it is easier to comprehend when they are in table form for instance in frontend javascript framework overview video it is better in terms of organization and aesthetic to show library vs framework in table formalso the volume of introduction to angularjs video is too loud though i can adjust it and lower the volume but sudden high volume sound is discouraging when the next video has normal volume causing me to adjust it againi was only able to watch few of the videos but they are good just a little improvement needed	2
very difficult with lots of math not properly explained whats the point of learned all these formulas by heart if you cannot use the properly because that is not explained well	2
a great way to learn how to focus on what really matters for starting a design project 	4
very good course	4
excellent introduction for the basic understanding of the machine learning very good structured easy to follow and understand course for anyone whose has previous exposure to linear algebra using matlab and octavethe mentors appear to be very active and hence should not be trouble for anyone without very strong background  read prerequisite like linear algebra especially for the assignments the assignments are self explanatory enough that i did all of them in just  weeks thanks to my  years of coding in matlab and linear algebrathanks very much prof ng and the team	4
ive enjoyed the materialideas in this course and the way kris plachy presented the information i do like her introductions before content and then ending each lecture with her summary and definitely enjoy her podcasts during the course they are very valuable and reinforcing i also appreciate her signature chuckle  gotta love it  m	4
each concept nicely and neatly explained	3
pros the course content covers a lot of relevant topics on database management things like basic sql queries database normalization conceptual and logical databases and making er diagrams are covered in the coursecons prof mannino is a bit robotic in his reading out of long sentences and the constant pace of talking there is tons of repetition of sentences and words mere seconds after they were just spoken the lectures seem to be a collection of bullet pointsthe assignments and the peer review structure is really a low point theres no specific grading rubric  so points allocation is random and based on your peers assessment i had many instances where my right answers were marked as wrong there is nothing you can do to correct it moreover the questions are iterative and thus the same apparent error carries on and you get multiple wrong scoresassignments need to be submitted in documents separate documents for each question  at times even a oneline answer needs to be in a separate document pictures of database diagrams need to be pasted in said documents it was a bit frustrating to take screenshots all the time especially when you make a small correction and have to take screenshots again then paste it again and upload again summary take the course for its content and use the assignments as good practice dont take the grading seriously also focus on the content rather than the delivery by the professor and you will still be able to get some value out of the course and the specialization by extension	2
thank you ive learned a lot from this course the flow of ideas from a topic to another was very smooth the cost model was very helpful 	3
covered many topics which are complementary to skills im improving or i wanna improve also usability is always something relegated on software engineering so its valuable to find a course to learn more about it	3
well structured course great presenter really interesting materials overall the whole  part course is well worth doing the bonus videos that the presenter does on real life examples are excellent and ive watched some of them multiple times the course is useful not only aa good introduction to pm tools and techniques but also to reinforce what the role of the project manager actually is	3
this stage of the course i feel could be summed up to just one week worth of work it mainly revolves around zmot and best marketing analytics and data collection techniques and rawly around  minutes of content and the last week was more of a lets sum up compared to the first stage where every single week had a new subject with lots of content this one i feel just didnt cut it i do feel i learned a lot from itand i plan to finish the specialization but this one should be aided as part of another another module	2
no translations available despite what subtitles and transcripts say	0
good but not enough 	2
its ok that the instructor always talks fast but he stammered a lot wish he could speak everything fluently	2
great course really explain in a real way how can i save a lot of time for important projects thanks	3
exercises need to be reviewed and corrected as they contain many typos and inconsistencies in not at pwc standard	2
all the complexity of the course is concentrated to the last week	2
very interesting to learn the basis of chinese  very simple and clearit is also a good basis to prepare the hsk but in my opinion it would have been interesting to have also the chinese characters writen in order to learn both at the same time	3
very interesting material but also very light instruction requires some matlab intuition	2
dont be fooled by how detailed and clear the first weeks videos are the second thru the final weeks are lacking details and explanations and found myself lost during most of the videos there were even a few typos and errors be ready to do a lot independent research and learning from other sources in order to complete the weekly quiz i was unable to complete the final project of this course due to the lack of knowledge provided by the lecture videos and some of own research i was hoping to complete the specialization for this but it doesnt seem like this course provided me with enough to proceed the use of excel on the weekly basis was poorly integrated with the flow of the course	0
i am trying from last  days to start my enrolled course but error message is displaying everytime kindly solve my problem	0
wonderful course excellently explained	4
it is an excellent course with good resources the only problem is that you need to know java to pass this course it should have better assignments to evaluate us	3
it is a great effort to try to explain writing an academic paper i appreciate it and unfortunately these guys have an awful english accent it is almost impossible to understand moreover their sentences are so long and complicated that makes it impossible to get it nice try but it doesnt work best regardsdr furkan	0
without any discussion forum and at least a mentor this course has nothing new to offer than a you tube video there are some inconsistency in the materials as well alluring student by the name of uci and giving the students the worst is hypocrisy	0
a must attend course for all students	4
the course was very interesting it touched upon all currently employed techniques in good detail the labbased videos were the most interesting however the lectures were too long it would be a brilliant course if the lectures were cut short and made to the point	2
extremely boring teachers	0
good courseunfortunately the last weeks worth of material wasnt particularly insightful or useful	3
among my registered courses in the specialization this course is the one that should be invested with more effort from creators in order to give students more practical lessons regards	2
the material is good but the format of the case study submission has allowed numerous cases of cheating and plagiarism	3
intro audio for each video is incredibly poorearly course videos have too much animation its distractingvideo  at  says certain jobs and tasks that are not value added are more easily outsourced but critical functions that are part of the companys value chain or the critical functions that give the product or service value to the customer should really be outsourced i assume that was supposed to say not be outsourced otherwise it doesnt make senselesson  the link to the irs page isnt hyperlinked you have to copy and pastemodule  final quiz questions arent worded wellmidlecture question pop up in the middle of sentences and sometimes even wordsquote from video  did you know that over  of candidates are now using mobile technology to look for jobs then the practice quiz question what percentage of job seekers use their mobile device to search for a job once a week or more and the correct answer is listed at  there is no mention of  anywherevideos often go silent for several seconds for no apparent reason these could easily be edited outweek  quiz q  improve employmentoutcomes  somebody forgot a spacepractice quiz  q  tell me about a time when you made a mistake is what type of interview question  answered behavioral but system marked wrong but under the answer behavioral note says behavioral tell me about a time so obviously it actually is the right answer	1
lack of insights and practical information	0
course has great material and i do like how the teacher explains the topics i wish course was fully free so i could have the chance to write my essays and get them reviewed	4
for a course that requires you to work on your own project it still forces you to follow a code skeleton outline this limits the freedom with which to tackle the projects issue there is not much guidance or support from course organizers which makes this course not very educative	1
excellent introduction in both theory and exercise thanks to this course 	4
this course provides a nice insight into the gaming theory do not expect to make a dive into video game analysis this game focuses on the fundamental ideas behind gaming which includes all games however the assignments revolve around building board games so you do not need to worry about not knowing any coding to make video games assignment criteria could use some polish as the rubrics focus too much on mechanics is it one page long rather than content elements the delivery of the content is interesting the instructor has gone to great lengths to bring in features that will help you focus better there could be a better  integration between the material in the videos and the assignments as sometimes you are asked to use only a tiny portion of  minutes of videos for the week and that can make the videos less useful or the assignment not as educational	3
this course will enhance and give knowledge to everyone	4
not a lot of practice problems and somewhat superficial information	2
i found this to be an excellent course both the instructors are excited about the work they are doing and do a good job of teaching the materials i dont have a statistics background and college calculus is more than a little fuzzy i was still able to understand most of the course	3
i learned so much however the lack of support when i got stuck made it a frustrating experience i would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips even then it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have im glad i took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level if the discussion forum was organized in a better way it would have helped  i had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes sometimes the question requirements were oddly or ambiguously phrased and i misunderstood the expectation for the function being tested	2
very good course with basic but extremely important concepts	3
very bad course	0
slides were informative but the lecturer did not add anything to them one could complete the course by purely reading the slides	2
on the bright side lab based videos are excellent for visualize the techniques nevertheless choose all that apply questions in the quizzes are very ambiguous these questions should contain an explanation for prevent confusion at the end of every unit	3
explains concepts very clearly anticipates and deals with possible stumbling blocks for students quite excellent	4
i will be using in my projectit is really important to articulate the various areas of my organization with the data censors can work transversally	4
pretty average and way too shortfast paced videos felt like it was put together on the fly i dont usually review but this was not great the reading material they linked to was the best content overall	1
in my opinion the sound quality is quite low and this makes it difficult to follow the lectures smoothly and i found the current response in the fqa section of the course to this problem very unusefull and discouraging i am guessing that the course is not really meant for absolute beginners and some previous knowledge of programming and such is needed i did not have any knowledge in those areas and i found it hard to follow everything mentioned in the course so i switched to another course on a different platform to be able to make the best of my time	1
the materials in this course were great but some of the math was not properly explained enough for the individuals to be able to see how the formulas were derived  especially some of the basic calculus and the regression materials i believe it would have only added  more minutes in one or two modules to do so since there were so few examples given this could be covered in subsequent courses within the specialization  i am not sure yet as i will be taking course  in the specialization starting next week otherwise this course was a great overview of the types of models used	2
very interesting	3
excellent helped me so much in my studies and in life in generali know it seems cliche but everyone should do this course i saves so much time and has so many extra videos that i found was really quality content	4
good course but the project of map isnt so clear	3
poorly designed executed and instructed too much is left off the materials	0
the slides are unclear and very very ugly and old stylethe assignment is very specific to linux based machineonly one programming assignmentmore theory than practicesthe qcms dont really help understand they are just about remembering valuesi woudnt recommande this course since it is more like a book then it is like a course	0
too much unnecessary videos content of lectures is poor tests are too easy	2
language is not good and lack of info	0
this course is divided into  weeks the first two weeks are about css and html i started this course as a beginner and was able to keep up with it for the first two weeks week three material isnt explained at all and for a beginner it is very difficult i wouldnt recommend this course to a beginner at all what i did like about the course was that the material is organized but that doesnt help if you dont understand what is being taught i dropped out of this course at week  good luck	2
assignments should be evaluated for all users unpaid ones as well like it is done for other wharton courses	2
it really just touches a lot on different machine learning techniques and really just sets the stage for the higher courses unfortunately some of the chapters especially deep learning are so brief that it is really frustrating trying to complete the quiz and assignment also the course doesnt use open source tools but a trial version of a pretty expensive library	1
a very very basic but complete introduction for anyone who just wondering what ux is or who want to structural hisher own practice in a logical and systematic mannerit also shows ideas if you want to understand deepertook me one day to go through the whole course fyi	3
i think the text of the programming assignments could be improved the minimum that should be done i think is to do some serious proofreading i found a lot of mistakes in language and english is not my native language	3
so far the best course available for matlab for young beginners	4
the course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff i gave it  stars for two reasons the videos are deceptively short in mooc instructional design you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an inperson university student however in this course even though the video is short it is really  times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself so the timings are not truly accurate if you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly in this case i wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching i would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible the hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science decomposition algorithmic thinking etc i was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python its poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment it would be ok if it were an accidental mistake but this seems to be purposeful this happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in midroll videooverlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown this was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying midlecture problems to no avail it cause all the timings of the course to be off  caused the video timings to be severely off and  meant that the course assignment estimates were hugely miscalculated good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment for some reason that was avoided again and again in this coursegreat material though i loved learning i just wish it were better structured and supported and that i learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something	0
quick primer of what management and supervising is about	3
overall i enjoyed this course but it gave just a bit too much information on cognitive studies in other species and it left me still wanting to learn more about dogs the last  weeks were great the professor was engaging and his work was very interesting but he said ummm and ahhh so many times that it was a little distracting the quizzes were good but some of the questions were worded very oddly so i just couldnt get them right without several attempts i didnt feel like he covered dog emotion at all i thought there would be some discussion of facial expressions the meaning of different tail wags and the extent of dog emotion for example how they grieve and how long they grieve after a loss	2
the material is very poorly explained precoded stuff isnt good either as its very hard to comprehend even with the professors explanations which also dont seem to be aimed at beginners	0
answers to week  are wrong no forum to discuss it submitted a case over a month ago  still no reply	0
too many lectures specialized audience with huge competition not accessible by novices of philosophy and only assessed through a single peerreviewed assignmentessay	0
the course is too boring i am not sure if it is because of the language or the lectures	0
was very frustrated with this course does not have a strong emphasis on excel skills and the statistics models provided seem to be randomly chosen and poorly explained quizzes were interesting but timeconsuming because of the necessary extra research outside of provided lectures	0
concepts on prospect theory is not explained correctly	0
great insights	4
should be lecture by professor instead of bs studentthe content was not well organizedalso should prepare slides and explain the swift for more detailsmore exercises needed in each weeks lecturehopefully this course should improve next time	1
great theory and practices	4
fantastic topic on itself yet delivered in a rushed manner programming assignments are of uneven difficulty the second assignment is all about a testing framework usage not really aimed towards functional design at all feels like the material worth  weeks was crammed into  weeksyou can still learn some important conceptions so it is not a total waste of your time	2
this course wasnt good many of the assignment instructions and questions were poorly written and students clearly had trouble understanding what was asked of them the assignments also werent very deep or imaginative and some of them requested very specific answers relying in keywords from the lectures rather than ensuring that the students had really understood the concepts the design principles were introduced at such a surface level as to be just silly rather than useful this was kind of a waste of my time	0
my issue with this course is the lack of depth most videos are shorter than  minutes the instructors race through their bullet points without developing the ideas enough the pace is frantic and the content is superficial i understand the topic is massive but that only leaves me baffled as to why there is room for  min videos in this course	1
very good course	4
only   because of technical issue that i faced in most of the videos are not loading properly  they will stuck somewhere and only audio will be continuing  so i couldnt finish the course apart from that teaching is really goodhope you guys work on it to fix it	1
this course is great for people like me who know almost nothing about the topic lectures are good points are clear understandable and not too long only thing i actually didnt like is amount of lectures the course is planned to be completed in  weeks and for me it was over in few days i would like to add that ive listened the lectures from work and spent  hours a day on it all in all im glad that ive started from here and plan to continue with the rest of the specialization	3
a basic course but not for the ones who dont know anything about java or android not made for the beginners also the submitting projects work is complicated and should be made more easiernot recommended for the starter	1
the assignments are well thought out and explain the algorithms stepbystep the subtitlestranscripts are a disappointment   full of mistakes sometimes to the point of being useless or even worse  saying the exact of opposite of what the lecturer says since the lecturer sometimes is unclear  this is problematic as usual  graphlab create sometimes crashes however there are explanations how to run the assignments using scikitlearn	1
i really enjoyed this course professionally done and very well structured never boring or too much info for a single week just perfect for my busy schedule thanks a lot ive had my introduction to chinese and will most likely further pursue this study	4
the subject is interesting but the presentation is dry boring in monotonous tone feels like somebody is reading a text book no pause between thoughts no animation of any kind i am sure the professor is a great scholar and authority on the subject but as a lecturer he is not that great it is unfortunate because i was eagerly waiting for the course	2
i was skeptical about the course at first the presentation seemed pretty oldschool although interesting as the course progressed and i applied the theory and methods from the course i started learning far better and absolutely love the course perfect for anyone and everyone who embraces lifelong learning	4
very thought provoking great class	4
week one starts with interesting material that relates probability to data science unfortunately as the course progress the course material and videos become less and less helpful ultimately the student has to visit other web sites and youtube to actual learn the expected material the course notes are next to useless and the video are equally unhelpful i am sure the teachers know their stuff but they have no idea on teaching it clearly based on the material presented in this course avoid this course and head over to khanacedemy and complete their probability and statistics program and you will actually learn all the material in this course with a ton of examples and top class videos	0
i think this course is great i like everything about it but i cant say the same about the quiz format it is rigid and nonstandardi gave up on the course many times because of thishow do write sqrt for instance  x must be x or it is not acceptablei am sorry this is pretty bad	0
nice introductory course very clear ans structured	3
i really enjoy this course since the learning materials mostly came from real life cases and it offer many insights regarding growth for private businesses	3
content regarding variable selection is kind of rough	3
great course i recommend it to anyone	3
very easy but probably helpful	2
good course but no statement of accomplishment certificate	1
a bit difficult to understand the language for non native speaker nearly impossible to complete works	1
its good	4
i get lost a bit too oftenthe teacher sometimes explains easy concepts and omits the difficult ones eg exponential distribution is explained as for example if you are waiting for a bus that comes every ten minutes and then he tells you how to compute expected value and moves on but he does not say what it means  is it the probability that i will meet an oncoming bus is it probability of waiting ten minutes for the bus is it the average waiting time is it average number of buses that come every hour  but there is detailed explanation of what a squared means in lesson two the teacher often makes me confused as to where he got the numbers he is plugging in the formula or what answer the formula givesbut i take it as a challenge and i intend to finish the course despite all of that sometimes it is fun to decipher the mystic equations and maybe it is me maybe i was not born to be a statistician maybe there are people that find this stuff easy and understand it right awayi really like the quizes they are hardone last thing wearing white shirt and using white marker makes it impossible to read what he writes but i take it is part of the challenge 	1
this was a very informative course thank you for the opportunity	4
i found the pronunciation of the italian lecturers very difficult to understand at times and i am english if i hadnt had the transcript i wouldnt have been able to complete this course to the level i like to perform at even those had some very unusual sentence constructions some of the questions in the quizzes were very badly worded and i had to guess the answers	2
this is already very very helpful with mastering the use of ableton understanding how the io functions work and polishing a track to the mastering level great program and very intuitive	4
i was very excited at the beginning of the coursebut when i figure out that i must paid for unlock some important lecturei really felt disappointed i thought i should only paid if i want to took the certificatei had been wasted some time at this coursenow i have to search for another course but complete one this time	0
this course was tremendously helpful in providing powerful tools to fight procrastination which is one of my biggest problems in learning the course also provided interesting insight into the workings of the brain and how we learn i now use what i learned in this course to realize when i am procrastinating then employ the tools from the course to fight it	3
i did like this course however it is very very basic i think it should have been merged with course  as the course contents are as good as one week work	0
i cant complete the course without passing the graded content but i cant complete the graded content unless i pay money and upgrade not the purpose of thes courses	0
great course	3
i think the course is really interesting	4
nice introduction but actually very little content	1
absolute genial curse really interesting for adquire new conceps and probably new ideas from this course the teacher is really kindly and explain the things very very good very friendly and easy to learn another important point is the data the techer leave at finish of each class very interesting papers for read and learn i liked a lot and i hope this techer and university will do another training similar to this thanks to all team for this impressive and interesting training thanks	4
very good course entertaining videos that keep your attention throughout and clearly outline and explain good practices for mentoring teachers highly recommended	3
fantastic course	4
its a good course to learn about data structures for beginers	2
very elementary introduction of key concepts some of the material is a bit dated toooverall it was structured nicely and not terrible	2
in general the instructors seem to think its a better learning experience to give the bare minimum in r then have the student hack their way to the answer using online forums etc while i get the motivation i think itd be better to give a more experiential learning platform  more swirl type exercises but deeper  to guide the student to the most efficient path to competency	2
very useful course i learn quite a lot thank you for the knowlege i now have much more selfconfedence in learning	4
bad learning experience materials were reasonable but the slides for the course were not made available no one answered questions on the discussion forums related to the course content and the only additional resources provided were to buy a book from the instructor	1
this course is better than statistical inference and i think it is as useful non credit excersise are still very good at helping with understanding in practice what is going on	2
too difficult the lessons go too fast	1
a great beginner course if youre starting out from scratch	3
very fast	1
i can access to some contents videos and lectures but i can not send quizzes or assignments and to get feedback without paying a fee for this course very limited 	1
very basic course	2
there are quite a few issues with the final assignment of the getting and cleaning data course i feel this assignments lacks quality in contents suffers from a flawed process and lack of attention by the moderator	0
adequate information to grasp on learn something useful but the videos are a bit boring that sometimes i have a hard time to carry on hope to share more interesting video examples and reading materials good effort but spice up the video a bit with salient stuff instead of pure talking and notes would be good	2
very informative	4
not practical enough	2
this course is a bit repetitive and provides only a few real life examples as well as this the evaluation of this course is based on the result of a single quiz of  questions which is not enough to prove any knowledge at all i think it should focus on a more practice oriented course in order to master the price optimization process and see how it fluctuates in real life exampleshowever this course gives great insights and useful concepts that are of huge importance to the application of the revenue management activities	2
the course material itself is enjoyable but the quizzes dont work properly the feedback given to the same responses between retakes is contradictory	0
exam questions are designed for raw facts instead of critical thinking and resoning sorry maybe its my poor english regards	0
waaay too basic and simple for a comprehensive principles course one or two concepts is not enough to gain an understanding the power behind online learning is that if it takes you three views to understand it all you have the luxury please beef up the videos and the assignments the assignments had no feedback mechanism so i could easily plow through them without any knowledge of whether i did them right	1
all the lectures are not clearly explained and a fresh person cannot understand few things and even in the assignments not mentioned properly what has to be done and if not how to solve them and how can you imagine the learner knows all the terms related to web or the particular language you need to explain the new terms which you use in the lectures and the lectures should be elaborate and should stress more on the basic things like abcdefg here you need to explain a in detail b in detail c in detail so on then after in the next lectures you can move fastlynot satisfied	1
quite easy but i learned a few things	2
great course and valuable information but frustrating autograder	3
not up to my expectations compared to the previous modules in this specialisation the lectures are dry the presenter is not focused and slides are sometimes mixed up the reading material is great and a definite plus is that it is free but the lectures should be more practical not just the bullet points of the book and the weekly assignment should not be a chapter summary question the course developers should have taken the time to develop a case study for each topic like in the first module in this spec i highly recommend reviewing and improving the content	1
this course was really informative and the lessons were concisely executed i recommend the course to anyone looking for a beginners introduction to coding htmljavascript my only criticism is that id like to have more peerreview projects to do because i think letting other people check someones work is a good way to see how they can improve	3
good introductory information	2
really enjoyed learning much more about how to understand what target market searches for and connecting with top influences of target market	4
not good enough only run run run and less participation than courses before add some wrong code to correct may be better	2
material is intense but the instructor does a great job explaining and simplifying a complex topic into a easy to understand course the projectsassignment are challenging but fulfilling and ties back to the course materials i highly recommend doing the assignment to get a full understanding	4
only theory no practice i dont need math at this point as i dont know even how to build simple machine learning program programming assignments come with no explanation it is not possible to finish this course without learning from other sources on the web materials attached to this course are not enough to understand the subject i have trouble understanding what the teacher is trying to teach from the very beginning of course	0
the course itself is very informative and enlightening the way coursera structures the submission of assignments though need to be seriously reworked to keep the numerous learners with creative unethical behaviors at bay	3
i found the course videos quite dull and uninteresting the topics covered could have been taught a lot better i finished this course only because i wanted to get through the specialization course i found that the course fundamentals of graphic design did an exponentially better job of explaining image making techniques and composition the assignments in this course are reasonably good but the instruction videos can definitely benefit from some additional indepth material	1
this a basic course and covers the collaborative style in some depth the case studies are the clinchers i would have loved to have more on the other styles as well	2
a terrific course	4
so far this is the poorest course in ds specialiation coins and dices all the time brian reads to the camera it is just like reading a book a very boring one examples from real life could boost interest	0
i wish the last week were more explanatory although overall now i do have an idea its a good course 	3
after about one hour the only things i learnt is to do stuff in different way too vague concept and the basic of photography	0
good insight into serious games learnt a lot of examples for serious games and the importance of the whole concept also how it can be combined with gamification towards the endmet a lot of people with some really great ideas for serious gamesgood lectures and interesting reading articles enjoyed the coursethank you 	4
very useful for me  a small farm manager	3
its a good course for anyone who wants to start learning basics of webdevelopment	4
this course is complete and does offer very good information on the music stories and art of the american south i really enjoyed the blues music information presented to students	3
quite good introductory course on script writing enjoyed writing my first pilot episode of my series	3
the gap between the lecture materials and programming assignment is enormous so much of lecture seem to be on the history and theoretical of r programming that it completely fails to cover the material needed to actually completed the programming assignments incredibly disappointing	0
very awesome course the professor is great	4
course was good for any beginner may be more technical details would further help	3
it is a good short course to get an idea about cloud computing big data and cdn points to the gentle instructor please try to elaborate more outside what is written in the slides and the other point please revise the cloud computing quiz as it focused on dates and history rather than focusing on the core of the subject	2
very basic knowledge	1
im learnng a lot and in my own waygracias coursera	4
where is the course study material and are you providing a book on this subject and excel you have me lost	0
a little propagandist but interesting with that in mind	1
every single step you need to complete succesfully a negociation	4
i am really sorry that a course with such a good content is ruined by the unrealistic assignement of week  that assignment will at least take  weeks to do and that should naturally lead to course length of  or  weeks which would be realistic so if you pay money for it start the course and do it till week  than pause and do the assignment and restart at a later date in order to comply to the necessary tasks the creators of this course did not react to our cries of help within a week poor support from them  the coursera team tried to help but obviously in vain what i learnt for future courses i will look into the detail of every assingment before starting and paying unfortunately in some courses you cant even look into the assignments when you havent paid this should be changed because i consider it a trick to lure someone into an interesting course and then making it impossible to finish it in the given timeframe not being able to see what will be demanded prior to paying may also be a coursera policy problem so maybe there is a better platform than coursera that lets you to be clear of what is ahead of you for a learner this is of great value honesty transparency and realistic information  because i have to plan and schedule how much time i can take for learning	0
great subject and some very well presented videos however there were several which were incomprehensible either because of the quality of the video or the very heavy accent of the speaker especially to a nonamerican viewer one doesnt always want to read a transcript but to listen and concentrate if all the videos had been of good listenable quality i would have given the course  stars	2
excellent content  but weak language commanding with a strong accent	3
it is cool but it does not give any certificate of completion at the end as other courses do	2
great course covers a lot of areas things do get quite advances particlarly later on in the javascript modules so you might have to watch it a few times yakoov does a great deal of explanation in order for you to understanding but somethings might not sink in straight away the assignments are a great way to troubleshoot issues and their is great support on the discussions fourm would recommend thank you	3
this is great course for both beginners and intermediates alike thank you	4
good course but the problem set is too small they will be much better if they are more	3
sound is too quiet	1
this is an excellent course for giving beginners a feel for how css works the projects are pretty interesting and fun too	4
the course was good exercise and martin does a very thorough job of covering the topics of the course i do wish the course focused a bit more on the assignment problems there were some interesting problems to work on and i dont think the discussion forums are a very helpful way of covering those topics	3
absolutely too perfunctory just a very slight notion of the subject	1
very comprehensive it also introduces to behavioral finance as well awesome 	3
its great to have the chance to learn this course	4
i was really interested in this course and i think the information is useful but i find it boring it didnt get my attention	1
this course and the specialization as a whole is poorly structured and a rather cursory overview that is unlikely to satisfy serious learners if the material is completely new to you then it will likely leave you confused as it does not adequately explain the concepts if you are already somewhat familiar and are looking for deeper dive into r and programming you will be disappointed as the courses just dont have the depth of material needed to gain mastery over the subjectyour money and time would probably be better spent on a couple of books by wickham	0
while the course is basic the tests dont test user concepts for example the order of the  step design process is asked  times through the  modules	2
nice form shallow content simply too simple beware upgrade  fee required for last two exams	0
excellent explanation and transition overview of how economics are growing however i was not from proper economic background and so faced some difficulties in understanding special terms used such as crawling peg anchoring etc worth it if you can do handwork and have a spark to learn global perspective of emerging market economies 	3
i was disappointed in the lack of explanation for the tools since everything depends on the ide and there was no instruction about the ide i found it difficult to do the labs in the course of trying to the ide somehow managed to corrupt my hard drive after that i pretty much lost interest in the course	0
you need to simplify it a little more	1
it was good insight into problemsolving in companies	2
tres bon merci beaucoup	3
this has to be the poorest educational experience ive ever had virtually nothing is explained the instructor says time  time again that shes not going to bother to explain in detail and that we should go out  explore all these free resources if we want to learn so why did i pay for this class honestly save your money this is nothing but a ripoff and i am shocked that an institution like u of m would allow such a sloppy lazy product to be out there under its brandto make matters worse we are instructed time  time again to go out onto the discussion board and ask for help when she doesnt want to bother explaining a concept everyone else taking this class is confused too  how could they possibly be of any help to me the staff who comes onto the boards are just about as rude  unhelpful as any ive ever seen they literally say well did you watch the lecture ummm yes i did  it directed me to come here for helpi feel duped this is a scam and i can only say i am sorry i paid my money for this if you really want to learn css get yourself a good book on the subject andor utilize the free material out on the internet this will absolutely waste hours of your time and way too much of your money for what they are providing	0
good overall but the content uses library and other content that make it hard to apply the technologies to the real world an emphasis on orienting the content to from scratch development would be duly appreciated i think nevertheless interesting and well presented over all	2
course content is quite interesting but it is a real pity that the english is so bad sometimes the lessons were very hard to follow and the quizzes often made little sense	1
very helpful for the freshman	4
course was informative and a useful refresher but could have done with more worked examples in the tracking area specifically around value	2
having to pay before you take the course is really disappointing not many students to interact with because of this course was very basic also not worth the money coursera offers many quality courses which are much better than this one	0
doesnt show the videos	0
the lectures videos are available intergrally on youtube whereas on coursera there are some parts that are missing the students answer on the blog are not answered from coursera staff	1
very basic its like reading the table of contents of a guidebook how to become an entrepreneur	1
a difficult subject made easy and interestingi wish there more exercise to practise home in order to master the concepts	4
this course is a total scam in doubt sign up for the free version and go watch the videos each video is only  minutes long so you can watch all  weeks in half an hour  speed  o i forgot they also include a link to a  years old ted talk fun but not really relevantthis course is a disgrace to coursera it ought to be removed	0
unfortunatelly i did not get anything from this course the course was based on a few obvious tips you get from any selfhelp or management book	0
very interesting course material however i do not recommend anyone to pay for the specialization	3
the videos have very little to do with tests	0
a bit too commercial promise the cure for finding a job  but what did you learn  this course might help you on awareness on your own abilities	2
the relevance of this course material for a common indian household is not much as our basic meal have almost all the component of balance diet but the growing trend of busy life in big cities has started the dependence on fast food in india too so somehow this will help people to remind the importance of home cooked food	3
this course content is very good but i got stuck sometimes because some program installation is very annoyingex bower	3
a great introduction	4
good course in general but it could use more exercises and solutions for those exercises it could be a great course in futurealso sometimes its confusing like you are asked to download code and write it along with the video but the files already at least partially contain the code that you should write and it looks quite different from the video	2
nice one	2
course is interesting but sometimes its so hard to perceive the information with such accent  im not lazy to read the subtitles no but they also from time to time work improperly and its not feasible at all to conceive the information  plus its absolutely inconvenient when you provide one huge assignment for several weeks at once why couldnt you make it a few smaller to every week i think ill disenroll	2
great course	4
motivation for guys like me to learn online which by the way is the best mode of study	4
good lecture and content	3
helpful but most of the information was general and could be found on any social media advice blogs while the instructor was funher videos could use more graphicspowerpoints or some sort of visual instead of just straight up talking	2
great	4
with acceptable technique using in data mining andrew did give us some intuition in ml although it need to further learning on some bayesian rules and math but its really worths it	3
i hope i can get scholarship and get a better job after complete this course	3
many outdated instructionsinexperienced tutors who almost never explain why things are done in a certain way	0
i find far too theoretical too dry no examples no exercise guidelines its almost having someone reading the slides to you still useful for someone like me that never done financial engineering to find all the concepts in one place hence the two stars as oppose to one	1
its great to know our emotions and make a better life	4
just read the slide the presentations add very little since the presenter is stumbling over just reading the text on the slides	0
i think it would be better if the professor had covered markowitz theorem and showed how capm is derived from the theorem i think the first two courses in the series are too basic and should be combined they are only useful from people who have no background in finance	1
for a practice course i found that was full of theory	1
no new learning during this course working on the capstone project is practically optional	1
i think this course could have been more interesting it was very dry with just slides and majority of the examples were not explained well especially the one about the marketing plan was not about plan but about presentation skills this course content definitely needs update	1
too long too academic not practical	1
really well structured course	3
theres a lot of great information in this course and its presented in a very good way however like the excel course in this specialization most of the material isnt about using tableau  week is about running a project  weeks are about using tableau and the final  weeks are about presentation if youre interest isnt mainly in tableau i would recommend the course however if youre taking this course to learn tableau i would suggest not paying for it	1
story telling module not really useful for iot purpose	0
too many obvious things	0
overall good course although at times narrow understanding of right answers	3
pretty simple overview of data science tools	3
awesome teaching technique used kudos to the team	3
hard work but i feel that i am working for something and learning a lot	4
great starter course was challenging at times as i started with a book on python  and this course covers  but overall very well done	3
good introduction to the material	3
excellent course thankyou	3
the course is a bit of a show maybe thats good for teenagers and millennials but not for me	1
this course probably deserves  stars in a better maintained form but the entire specialization is not maintained the lectures have no production values basically its a money pit that coursera is keeping up cynically its a real shame because the syllabus correctly addresses a gap in most data scientists skills	1
needs way bigger scope and a bit more going into details the full stack web development course is somewhat like that lectures are good and easy to understand both visuals and speak are nice and clear hopefully next one remains great quality but with more content 	2
audio on videos was sometimes unclear course content was interesting	2
shame that the format was changed and the quizzes and assignments were not open teaching was as great as the first  courses and slides were useful	2
lectures clear and wellorganized homework needlessly complicated and with large gap from lecture material grader did not give enough info when rejecting submitted work weighting last problem at  of final week was unpleasant hosted platform allowed importing re and iostringio but grader rejected them hosted platform had consistent kernel failure on my last solution but it worked on another system and grader accepted it	3
after going through each lesson week by week and thinking i was really learning something but i cant pass the first exam even with my notes and google and almost had a panic attack when i looked at the second exami feel like i wasted fifty dollars and hours of my life in order to get what little belief i had that i might have actually learned something come crashing down	0
this course is a short introduction to javascript their is some useful information that is very very interesting and easy to understand but it is too little to understand js	2
not worth the time and energy	1
absolutely useless random unexplained list of facts and advices that is thrown to a learner without any attempt to give a systematic approach pure waste of time and effort can only be suitable to those who already know the subject well and can use some additional facts that are randomly presented in this course	1
good introduction	3
not bad the professor is very comunicative but i expected a bit more of contents	2
dont put your irrelevant politics in games	0
what are you talking about	0
learned a lot of the fundamentals of objectc	4
interesting learning course you need to stick to follow the videos may seem a tedious by moment overall a good average course	2
great course until now	3
i am almost done with the course the course is a great intro touches on some of the important subjects but it lacks the depth required to cover the topic appropriately would love to see a specialization in this topic with more hours and content covered	2
i didnt really care about the stories from the students or seeing the space for one whole lecture video its clear that ultimaker is the sponsor but it felt like a commercial i want to learn more	1
not much of a course i understand why it exists but its basically just getting setup with the environment almost not worthy of course status	2
great course for learning swift	3
boring	1
too much history	2
it can be better however i learnt useful tips	1
the explanations are not clear the course is very theoretical theres just one obligatory programming task its one of the worst courses i have ever enrolled in	1
the mix of materials from different courses hurts the structure of this course	1
very good course still in the beginning but liking so much	4
knowledgebased no skillbased work at all which is weird since the capstone is skillsbased	2
if youre unfamiliar with how big data is processed and what makes it unique from regular data this is a good introductory course it provides sufficient detail to understand the key concepts programs and methodologies around big data	3
too elementary i would recommend this course for nontechnical managers or securitycoding beginners under the age of 	0
excellent i really enjoyed and learned a lot thank you	4
the only reason for enrolling is to complete the data science specialization though it may make you reconsider continuing with it the instructor and provided materials fail to adequately explain the concepts this course is supposed to cover and do not prepare students for the quizzes or assignments if you dont know statistics you wont learn it here if you know statistics you dont need this course	0
the course is far too much introductory and the practical assignments are not challenging enough yet it is only an introductory course for the iot specialization	2
very poor never expected this from coursera the person is just reading the slides there is no learning action taking place	0
the lectures and swirl exercises are extremely easy to understand and follow but then the assignments are incredibly complicated and difficult the assignments ask for techniques that arent focused on or even covered in the lectures the tips offered by al warren in the discussion forum make the assignments possible to do since the tips are so critical to understanding and completing the assignments i think al warrens tips should be incorporated as part of the core course this course needs more time to be covered in depth  its a lot of ground to cover in just one month	0
interesting lecture series the lectures are largely america centered with courses on presidential war powers the functioning of governors in this lectures the main focus is rather politics than policy although very interesting the lecture series does not really live up to its title	2
peer reviewed assignment not a well planned marking system grades can be to vary dependent on fellow students for pass not most ideal	0
very nice course with good demonstration and practical assignments	4
good course for introducing to fu	4
simple  clear  handsome teacher	0
it gives a good idea about this market although some of the ideas could be more systemized and clear	2
not much is taught here but i guess should be a good beginning for the specialization	2
this was an extremely elementary and thus disappointing course while the importance of usability was rightly emphasized the representation in terms of examples case studies etc was simplistic i appreciated having my attention drawn to the pitfalls of hci design and the consequent failure of the corresponding systems however the solutions were presented as if  there are always correct interfaceusability choices  the correct choice is all thats needed for the system to be optimally functional and  there is never a tension between usability and effective functioning of a system that cant be resolved with correcting the usabilityit is irresponsible to suggest for example that a user selected memorable password is generally adequately secure without also covering ways that an interface can guidenudge the user to create a secure password wide recognition of the importance of this may be more recent than the studies covered in the course there is nothing wrong with studying old seminal research even in this age of internet time but i wish i wasnt left wondering what if any developments had occurred in the decade or so since that research took placeas for tension between usability and security it absolutely exists for instance pgp encryption is a reliable way to secure information yet making it usable remains a challenge this is not even mentioned in the entire course in fact this course would leave an otherwise uninformed student believing that there are usability solutions waiting to be applied to every cause of info insecurity if the techies would just look i wish the course had at least acknowledged that there are cases where a slight compromise on usability might be necessary for the sake of appropriate securitylastly for those designing an hci for security it is important to understand threat models this concept is also missing from the coursei reviewed this course above immediately after i finished it i am now in the rd week of software security the nd course in the cybersecurity specialization and am realizing that  stars was a generous assessment based on the prerequisites of the software security course the usable security course in its current form is too elementary to be appropriate for people who have the experienceknowledge required for the rest of the courses in this specialization as i explained above the course relies heavily on decadeold research but does not cover any developments since for instance the usability issues covered in the studies are for ancient versions of browsers with no discussion of how the browsers and our infosec vulnerabilities have changed since those studies were published another example is the instructors eschewing of password managers while many knowledgeable folks in the infosec community today recommend their use the usability challenges of password managers and a discussion of how they might be mitigated would have been more appropriate	0
too expensive to be that simple	1
ok really good	3
a bit complicated for a beginner	2
best short and brief video as well as presentationsit helped me lot to learn new styles and approches towards negotiations which is part of daily life these daysthanks to the team and coursera	3
pretty basic stuff	0
there should be more than just lectures i find the overall content to be very exciting but at times the lectures get a little boring and monotonous maybe	2
not worth  considering you could take away very little from this course	0
its ok the lectures are good the book needs updating and more exercises would be helpful to practice what we learned in class	2
its really help me a lot to build up my basic concept and now data wrangling is quit bit easy for methanks 	4
exercises in the course were very poor simple and did not require coding just changing one or two lines but topic was interisting	2
peer reviewed assignments are a joke assignment was not verified which is not possible seeing how before you submit you have to verify assignment	0
an amazing courseif you are reading this please dont miss the opportunity to learn important tools that will develop not only your capacity to learn new things but will also in deepen your self knowledge by giving you an interesting insight of your brain and how it works	4
the final exam was way too difficult compared with the knowledge provided by the lessons	0
really superficial overview i suppose its good for just familiarizing oneself with assigning the appropriate model but to shallow for any real carry over to the real world	1
thanks very much thanks to this course named work smarter not harder i found the way which manages effective time	3
simple and clear explanations to solve problems	2
quizzes are useful exercises but need to do a lot of self studying	2
the course material as presented appears to be at least four years old history has proven many of professor sheltons conclusions to be wrong having professor shelton read his powerpoint slides is a very dull way to convey information i expected more from georgia tech	0
great	3
very good but should be longer	3
it teaches an interesting topic but its a bit hard to follow the teacher i learnt from the exercises mostly	2
too basic	1
informative	4
the best teacher i ever met in  year of studyi wish one day i can meet you thanks for your wanderful teaching	4
 usd just to be able to submit peergraded assignments talk about greed	0
for beginners is wary good 	3
this course was an interesting introduction to positive psychology it possess a strong resemblance to my beliefs concepts and ideologies from buddhism i would certainly recommend this course to my colleagues and friends kudos to the team	3
great introduction course in python	4
great coursegreat instructori now have great new data manipulation skillsthank you	4
videos fine quizes impossible to understand unless you take previous courses and have time to go through forums and more extra staff it takes a lot of time not suggested unless you have it	1
i will review this course appointing its pros and conspros the instructor he is a captivating person it really seems that he like game development he make jokes and try to make the course interesting so hes personality is makes the course less boringcons the course name when i saw design in the course name and the icon of course page i thought it would be related to graphic design or history telling and so on but no the design means project so i think a better name would be principles of game project although it might be just me who thought this way because in my language design means something totally different the course content this course should be at the end of the specialization it is too much abstract and in some aspects very obvious i will not say it is completely useless because it is not it gives us a structured view of the stages of game design and its documentation but i think it would be better if it was like a case study the assignments probably the worst part of the course they very very complex to be sincere none of the assignments i reviewed were full i gave max grades to many because i think the person tried really hard to make it imagine this situation you are not a programmer not a graphic designer not a writer and with a week you need to make a prototype of the game idea youve been working on course this prototype must show the game mechanics and aesthetics should be playable and can be non digital come on we are here learning the concepts of developments digital games and the instructor says that we can make a non digital prototype some people did it and i can say for sure that i couldnt imagine the real game i made a digital prototype using the knowledge acquired from the first course but as you can imagine it is not enough to make our game ideas come true the peer review system the grading is completely non sense as i said before the assignments are complex so it is difficult to show our ideas clearly in a document without the abilities to make concept arts or something in  of the  assignments  of the  people gave me max grades and  gave me bad grades and did not left any feedback one of the assignments when i first submitted it i got  then when i resubmitted it without changing a comma i got  so i think this system must change maybe the mentor should do itif you want to do all the specialization ok go and do this course but if this is not your objective do not waste your time	1
great	4
the lecturer and the course are great perfect for beginners	4
not good for people who would like to learn from basics	1
the lectures for this class are incredibly weak later lectures by the same professor are reasonable and decently structured these lectures need to be redone the quizzes are either outoforder or expect you to do a lot of research on your own beyond the class notes and topics the class project is unbelievably simple and the final metric for the class project includes duplication and one portion of the grade assigned simply if you feel the person youre grading tried	0
too short	1
would vastly prefer if this was taught using sckitlearn and pandas given their broader use	2
this was a simple and interesting course i would love it to be a little bit broader and present the information in more context but still excellent course	3
i thought she was a nice teacher but didnt teach the basics steps into speaking  learning chinese if she had started with abc alphabet how to write  speak the first week then taught to sound each letter out in different pitches of volume week then to sentences building rd week so on it would had been much more helpful i believe i sad that i had to leave the course bc it seem and look like a great obertonty  but it went to fast didnt cover what i expected it would 	1
the course was great in that it moves you to write i actually completed a pilot script that i was very proud of my only criticism of the course would be the peer review for the most part the reviews were weak and lacking substance i put a lot of energy into reviewing classmates works but i cant say that i got back what i put out this may be improved with a video teaching students what kind of feedback is expected of them other than that its worth the time	3
unfortunately i found this course to be the least enjoyable so far in the specialization im not sure if i was just jarred by the change in instructor but i found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling im not sure if shes a mother or not but thats the way she comes acrosslike shes trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten yearoldsa majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class and she would often list things she was going to talk about and then ignore one of those items entirely in fact one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map something that was mentioned in the lectures but not gone into in depth at all i tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logicalultimately im very disappointed with this part of the specialization i dont feel like it was worth my  and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning ux designer to learn and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth	1
one of the absolute worst final exams ive ever seen vague questions coupled with synonymous answers form a frustrating experience that ruins an otherwise decent entry in security topics	1
this is a very exciting course i have always admire the simplicity and beauty of koreans alphabet with this i can hopefully find way to interact with koreans someday im really thankful for this thanks again 	4
the content of the course is good and i feel it would be beneficial for beginners or those who want to top up their technical  academic knowledge on the subjecti found the terrible editing of the lectures distracting though and it felt like no one bothered to oversee the final version that was published i also dont think the fact that one has to pay so much to access the assessments which many other courses dont do at all is conducive to creating a strong engagement in the course i wouldnt for example be encouraged to take another course from this series not sure if one is offered	2
learned a few things from this course	2
the syllabus is well framed understanding the wide audience the format and the duration wish the course was in english it would have star rating from me thanks	3
excellent course for starting web developer i feel that i got solid foundation for learning more advanced front end frameworks this course also introduced important development tools and good tips for using them effectively	4
decent coverage of the basics but some of the data tools and approaches used are out of date by  years which is particularly troublesome in the fastmoving social space for example they rely quite a bit on data from  and  and from social tools and reports from ibmfor someone completely new to the social space this could be a great starter class just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure youre currentafter grading assignments by other students it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat most either didnt invest in the assignments or didnt understand the materials while i have found the discussion portions of other moocs to be equally interesting to the class material i didnt have that experience in this session	2
pretty great  specifically g	4
thank you all instructors  teachers 	4
ok you can learn a few things getting into this course and its still available for free on the platform so thanks for thathowever and most of all you can sense that this is more of an advertising campaign for axa im than an investment course per se during the  modules youre basically repeated over and over again that active management ie investment managers tend to overperform and that you should have one managertheres even the overall st part of module  that is dedicated on how to select a managerthere are some great insight related to portfolio allocation but not much explanations a major point that i would have liked to hear about is how to come up with the risk aversion criteria many parts of the course relate to external videos available on youtubeif youre going to advertise on such a platform as coursera please dont make it too much about the advertising and more about learning for example melbourne university specialization	0
great instructions and overview of portfolio and risk management	4
it was a good basic intro into the statistical methods of epidemiology quite basic	2
a very nice warming session that stirs awareness into food nutrition and health	2
too basic and superficial	1
maybe the pace is a little drawn out	3
not aligned to pmi should be ideally directed towards helping prepare for recognized certifications like pmp prince etc	0
wonderful practical course	4
as other reviewers have noted this course is not for beginning programmers unless maybe you are a mathematical genius with total recalli have a little background in programming html and css but i found this course to be an absolute nightmare it would be interesting to find out if any of the rave reviews came from real beginnersmost of the problems have already been noted by other reviews so i will only mention a few that i did not see mentionedthe course requirements should include hardware and software essentials in particular the student has no choice but to use android studio if their system is not running a bit os at  ghz with at least  gb of ram it can literally take days for studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment codethere is a desperate need for a glossary the course dives in with more acronyms than the military and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on apis sdks etc not to mention many other technical terms interfaces  if i asked the average programmer to evaluate the mt based on comparisons with the complutensian polyglot and codex alexandricus the effect would probably be about the sameanother glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each conceptskillas for weve organized all these topics into units that represent roughly  hours of work each that is absurd if you multiplied that by  it would still be a stretchi have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors though there are some errors in a number of the instructions and im sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn the root problem seems to be what professional communicators call the curse of knowledge  a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is notmy recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else take a good introductory course in java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the android environment i am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer but i have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner coursemy recommendation to the faculty is to completely reengineer this whole specialization they should have a separate set of courses truly designed for beginners and they should get help from qualified instructional designers who specialize in online adult education might not be a bad idea to get the vu english department to review the lecture text as wellmy recommendation to anyone is to never believe anything coursera tells you about a course audit the course before you pay any money this is especially important if the course has not actually started this course started two months late and i could not get a refund before the course even got under wayafter taking nearly  months to wade through a little over half the course requirements i decided to look at the rest of the assignments and project this removed all doubt that to continue was a hopeless waste of time so i decided to end the nightmare and im glad its over	0
absolutely useless at least in the free version	0
excellent introduction to a beautiful language	3
very nice course concepts are covered very clearly	4
not very motivating way of talking about the topic also its getting old hes lecture is sometimes colored like a stereotypical texan his extrapolations as flawed as those of the eia which by now can be seen with hindsight	1
not very useful somehow general	1
the topics are really interesting and advanced however theres a lot of talk in chinese due to questionsanswers from teacher and students and the quizzes are a bit too easy i learned a lot though	2
i wish the duration between each week was a bit more and there was an option to chat with the faculty directly	3
this is the worst course online ive done so far i would not recommend it to anyone as it stands regardless of the students background this course is just poor and lackingthe premise of this course is a promising one the topic is still in its infancy and seems very interesting having said that this is about everything positive that i can say about this coursefor starters the videos seem good at first but later it becomes very superficial and monotone the content is many times just rushed through and its visible that the lecturers at several occasions have difficulty even to read their own slideshowever the worst part of the course are the quizzes there are  graded quizzes in total to pass the course you need to pass all  of them to make matters worse the minimum passing marks for each quiz is  that wouldnt have been such an issue if most quizzes had  or more questions which is not the case most of the quizzes have  or less questions this is such an unreasonable requirement if you miss only one question in a quiz with  questions theres already no chance to pass the coursethe content of each quiz is also very troublesome we are essentially being graded for trivia a considerable number of the questions are very superficially related to not related at all to the subject of each lecture instead of using the questions to delve deeper into the topic at hand they only create confusion with futilities a little example the topic of a subject was about the mechanical properties of using multiple templates and a question in its quiz was about an electric circuit that is never shown in the question itself only briefly shown in the lecture video for about s minimal information is given without any explanation of what they mean and we are asked to enter a formula as the answer for which also almost no information is given about which notation we should use for the formula itselfthere are other cases where there are multiple choice questions which have incorrect answers accepted by the grader in one instance two of the options available are contradictory to each other however the accepted answer was the one involving both in another instance there was more than one solution available to an answer however the grader accepted only one and there was no information in the question itself to narrow down the possible answers to the desired onefinally there is no active community by the ta and professors i have never had a single answer form a ta or professor only sporadical replies from a mentor who has no authority to fix any issue by him or herselfall these issues just point to how poorly this course was designed it had such high hopes but they fell short flat in doing this course i found myself reverse engineering most of the questions just to try to find an accepted answer and try to understand what it meant the imposed hour period between attempts at the quizzes only hindered my progress i was focused and engaged in studying for each quiz however after  failed attempts i had an imposed break period that makes little sense in the end this course only made me feel like the very object of my learning a roboti am really disappointed with this course	0
useful tips for writing	3
i thought the content layout for courses  and  were okay however when i got to course  using python to access web data i was extremely disappointed this specialization is advertised as one does not require programming experience course  however introduces a variety of computer science topics that i believe cause information overload for a beginner a student is bombarded with information about regular expressions the http protocol web sockets urls html xml json and apis in fact the video lectures spend the majority of the time explaining these concepts while spending very little time explaining how to use python to access web data the corresponding book python for informatics was of little help understanding the assignments like the videos the book lacks sufficient numbers of examples the few examples that are given lack adequate explanations of the code they contain i found myself on many occasions asking what exactly does this line or block of code do and could not locate the answer if not for the forum i would not have been able to complete th	0
very interesting and compelling course and i liked the questions every few minutes during the lectures as that helps me to retain informationmy only complaint is that the lecturers manner of speaking is very rhythmic and repetitive and that makes it kind of hard to lose track of his words	3
this is a reasonably thorough introduction to the principals of functional programming in scala but to fully grasp the material presented i found it necessary to include supplemental material such as the functional programming in scala book by paul chiusano forward by the course instructor funnily enough one point of frustration however was the near total unavailability of the course tas or instructor also because the only forum for interacting with them is entirely public its impossible to receive any formal code review apart from the automated tests they run when you submit there were multiple occasions where i wanted feedback on not just the technical correctness of my solution but also to know if there might have been a more idiomatic or generally efficient read tailrecursive way to express some peculiar bit of logic	2
this course is incredibly good it is helping me to learn how to learn but also has give me a new passion for neuroscience and some related topics the teachers are excelent i think that im going to do it two times	4
an insight into pwc way of doing things the course was worth the time effort and investment on top of all it has pwc to ensure its value	3
one of the worst course ever	0
bad for the projects	0
very short course	2
this is really bad structured as analogy  imagine a cookbook that says in chapter  youll learn how to cook pies but here in introduction let me tell you how to add baking powder in them it is not useless information it is just very out of placelearning some git commands was the most usefull in the course for me though again why would you first show the commands and just after that explain whats the tool for and where to download itand by the way it takes half a day to cover all  weeks material listened through all videos installed the tools which is not bad just of other users information	1
i would recommend the coursera online training session need more improvement please look at this youtube video this will give you some fair idea what do i meanhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvawyzvmfduring the session speaker need to be visible on top corner and they need to present with more examples during learning this will help and learn fasti struggled a bit following your videos going backandforth with the given materialsi also struggled solving the assignment due to confusing questions not much clear what is required to solve the problem it would be helpful to provide some hints for each assignment	1
it is great for medical student	4
everything was either super basic or else more advanced but so niche that it doesnt really apply to everyone and we dont need to learn it in that depth would have liked to learn a lot more about how to determine what kpis you should be measuring in different businesses what kinds of metrics are important etc the very large majority of this course will never be applicable to me	1
too little content for the price	1
this is a joke right minutes long videos with questions after it shall teach me effectiveyou guys are ridiculous	0
loved it	4
i cant reach the course contents because of new deadline that coursera has invented	0
nice introduction to problem solving and decision making	3
interesting intro to some powerful ideas	3
very poor even though for the most part i found the videos engaging the courses overall structure doesnt help to read the novel together as is stated in the title the quizes are poorly written even for me a native russian speaker it was often hard to understand the questions and sometimes its plain guess work on the opinions of the course authors often a required number of answers to pass a quiz is the same as the total number of questions in that same quiz the essays topics rarely correspond with the actual reading of the book for the very first week the essay required knowledge of the book that hasnt been read yet by the participants or it should be stated that one needs to read the book prior to taking the course then again that would require the change of the courses name	0
i have really learn a lot through the participation of the course and would like to sincerely thank the people conducting the course to make the course so enriching and also interesting	3
the programming exercises should not be optional i still intend to do them but now i passed the course with a  mark but only  of knowledge	1
the course was clear i had difficulties to find course materials especially examples were used in the video class i wish they had been put in more obvious places	2
great course everything is broken up into manageable pieces and the assignments are challenging im up to week six and am learning a lot	4
the course is a very good introduction to python for data exploration and managementthat being said it focuses too much on categorical data analysis and i felt the transition to quantitativecontinuous data was not very well donemoreover some more explanations about several python functions or coding choices could be better explainedbut its encouraging to see this type of statistical course for python and not r again	2
bad content and instructor no logistic in place if you are planning to pay to get certificate i would suggest look else where my  are stuck in here and they dont reply to forum posts	0
i am a teacher and i found many useful tips for my students and their parents in this course	4
needs to cover more material in a more engaging way felt too lecturebased and observational possibly storytelling itself needs to be anchored more to specific usage occasions	2
descriptions was not enough for me the bmc concepts could be more elaborated by giving examples and explaining different types of businesses	2
i couldnt take the instructor seriously there were too many comparisons to harry potter and various three and five act formulas i wanted something that would be practical and adaptable to the ideas that im working on this just wasnt the right course for me the assignments felt like they were pointless as well	1
the course is not interactive enough its a waterfall of dry information id expected more based on the generally good reviews say more examples better videos think twice before buying	1
same as the theory class not much examples or case studies	2
good content	1
the technical support of this course is just terrible just like many many other students see the discussion forums i have experienced serious difficulties to access the databases platforms we need to learn and to complete our assignments i can only echo the innumerable complains from my costudents about the lack of efficient support and technical reliability of this course many of us are very unhappy about this especially as they have paid for this course  and what is coursera doing about it by the waymy advice beware before enrolling in this course and even in this entire specialization and search for alternative options there are many not only on coursera but also on edx and others 	0
low on actionable content was looking for some specific tactics to use but even though the course syllabus refers to tactical information on influencing people it lacked any specificity to make it useful	0
it is necessary more examples for to understand more clearly the topics	3
the course is too much focused on the us	2
came to know some basic research strategies enjoyed the assignments good course catered for grad students but undergrads can also benefit from the reading material provided	2
the content is really interesting and useful however the way in which the lessons are organised id say is confusing the professor explain you complex concepts like entropy or binary classification to continue with an excel worksheet its here where the issue relays the excel files are filled and instead of learning by doing you have to figure out how the prof made the file in consequence the solution is always availablein my opinion itd be better if a raw data set is given and you build the model step by step from the scratch	1
very good explanation	3
the pace is two slow	1
such a boring course no challenge at all no meaningful example and in the end seems that everybody grade without any reason i dont think ill finish the specialization its too expensive for such a poor quality	1
very useful course	4
good introduction to what can be done with google cloud platform	3
easy and pointless	1
too much material to get done in time frame given for fulltime working parent	0
prof taylors lectures were clear and easy to understand the course taught the basics of planning pretty wellthe teaching staff unfortunately was completely unavailable the solution checkers for the matlab assignments were very brittle and wasted a lot of students time there were several queries about the assignments on the discussion forums most of which did not elicit any response from the teaching staff the students ultimately figured it out by spending several laborious hours figuring out the peculiarities of the solution checkers and by helping each other this certainly soured my experience with the course	1
expected more technical details of this course seems like it is more for managers to understand what the techies are talking about	2
it was very nice to get my skills expanded i would be very helpful if the professor included handouts with functions definitions and instruction eg on how to create a histogram this way it would help to review something later without the need to open the videos again and searching for the content one is looking for	3
this course targets mostly students audience but not people with the aim of selfdevelopment who passed their academic study long time ago therefore information concerning learning process somehow too much basic but at the same time can be quite useful if you are not aware of all these facts what didnt also suit me is a lack of structure and a bit confusing videos explaining different concepts of brain structure and functioning that seemed too much scientific in the frame of this course but what really hit my interest is enthralling optional interviews with different scientists and just talented people they were really motivating and inspiring	2
i would give it a  with the extra  because of the great interaction ease of use and clarity of progress it was pretty hard for me and i barely made it in under the deadline jumping session to session to complete you definitely need some r background by the end for the project i expected to get more in information in using r for inferential statistics too though there was a presentation and each lesson had followup for use in r great use of examples for each section that helped me a lot	2
absolutely amazing a musttake course for machine learning introduction	4
i saw two main issues with this course  dated lecture videos oftentimes with r code that cant be replicated using uptodate packages and  lack of thoughtful design example after example after example after example doesnt really teach you anything	1
excelent teacher	3
very very exciting i recommend 	4
good introduction but the professor could have been more descriptive about how to use gitgithub these are new concepts for people so it may be difficult to grasp right away	2
a lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course many were passed onto look this up yourself which is fine but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong the group_by stuff was especially tricky as it was unlike its sql counterpart and could have used a better example eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns other than that very interesting overall and very neat datasets i would encourage having students check out kagglecom for extra credit	3
theres a little bit too much in the way of buy organic when theres no evidence to recommend that but other than that a very nice course i would recommend that they retool it to be more accessible to people on the lower income brackets i got news for you almond flour is not something most people are going to spring for when it costs several times what wheat flour does	3
the title of this class should have read programming for anybody that already knew a decent amount about basic programmingcontinuing with python	0
the lectures and assignments dealing with ionic were useful and informative but thats only the first half of the course the androidios portion felt extremely rushed for all of the hassle of setting up my android environment i get one week of lecturesexercises out of it and that only covers rudimentary functionality	0

any course that requires a webcam is not serious what a bunch of ridiculous crap is this for adults trying to learn or teenage girls trying to chat	0
i really enjoyed this course as it made me stop and take the time to not only make art but to have fun with it this course made me think about different ways to blend art and text the different elements within a typeface and font i learned a lot of new and important things to consider regarding graphic design and i really enjoyed the instructors way of teaching thank you for taking the time to make courses like this so easily available to individuals like me who do not have the time or funds for traveling to a formal college	4
not clear illustration many problems are not directly related to the content covered more importantly it sucks	0
should include recent material a reference book from  is very out of date especially in the software world	2
although it gives an introduction to r however the structure of the course overall was not up to expectation or objectives of itthe videos were very much theoretical and boring introducing too many concepts although basic was not related to the programming assignments i had to google almost all assignments its arguable that this is one way of learning and more of realistic but on the contrary as im paying to get the knowledge i shouldnt be wandering around to understand something that shouldve been taught in the lecturesmoreover i think that the videos need to be updated the mentors need to be more involved in the forums and the way the slides are presented within the videos should be more interactive or dynamic rather than being just captured lines of codes	2
fantastic course wish i had taken this class andor read dr oakleys book when i was an undergraduate in college andor in graduatebschool so many wonderful trips and tricks for getting the most out of your education and learning experience i enrolled in the course to learn new and effective methods for absorbing and applying information more quickly in my professional working life while also balancing the demands of running a startup in the evenings fivestar course	4
explanation could have been more clear especially for polynomial multiplication	3
good course but paid i cant submit the task	2
i think the course requires some basic statistic knowledge which i do not know anything about it is tough to keep out if providing some basic reading or keynote before hand would be really helpful	2
i have seen reference to the previous second course on the specialization functional reactive programming in scala comparatively this one looks much easied down i am hoping to find the excluded content on the third course sessions by erik surely are a  pertinent and consistent within the full syllabus they were conceived for but inserted here they break a bit the overall discourse in my view got the feeling that the exercises cover only a little part of the theoretical content exposed in the lectures	2
extremely generic and a but to much of selfpromotion	0
fantastic initiation to spark thanks heather and the whole team at epfl  coursera	4
excellent course very interesting and fun i recomend it	4
the whole waste of time and energy	0
i only dislike the fact that wasnt very clear the instructions for the final project every work i reviewed and also mine were very different i think that everybody understand a different thing and that wouldnt happen if the instructions were clear	3
im not a teacher but found many aspects of this course very useful to better organize at work or in my free time	3
very boring the professor is just reading with a bad english the illustrations are also very boring	0
excellent introduction to ruby on rails	4
first of all i expected something deeper first of all this courser is less understandable than the swift programming language free book from apple before i join the course i have read a few chapters and from my point of view book explains material much much better the second point  it looks like tutors invent examples during the lesson on the fly this is bring a mess and last thing about this course that tutors commit an gross error during lecture please have a look at advanced swift lecture i am talking about closures the teacher said that closure captures the copy of outside variable but this is completely wrong closures capture the variable itself not the variable value	0
outdated materials theory is taught and then praxis is tested course needs an update to materials and either teach and test theory or teach and test praxis i passed this class by switching sessions multiple times in order to use the time to learn the practical skills in data visualization i needed to pass the testsadditionally the presented materials and the lecture format are very uninspiring	1
the slides are excellent and instructions are clear and to the point but that point is very limited the main negative about this class is that there is absolutely no studenttateacher feedback and youre pretty much on your own learning	2
the answers to the test questions can be improved significantly most of them can be both justified or refuted	1
several mistakes in the programming assignment	3
really good introduction for anyone who doesnt know probability nor rif you already know the basics of both maybe this course is not for you	4
wonderful course very interesting and very well explained also the teacher is a very kind and helpful person at least in twitter p thanks daniël	4
very superficial and too few insights could have been delivered in  hour probably ok for people with no knowledge at all in it or finance	1
this course can be a bit dry at times but still very informative	3
enjoying the course	3
i think everyone should take this course although some of the lectures are hard	3
the only reason i passed was because i ignored the lectures and asked others for help once i did that finance became a lot easier to understand	0
i really enjoyed this course it is easy to understand and it motivated me to use what i learnedimmediately	4
very boring not many real life advices mstly theory	0
it seems that all these types the course is based on are not quite scientifically proven also the materials are very proamerican culture like this link httpmentalflosscomarticlemyersbriggstypechartspopculturecharacters not very helpful and inclusive	1
this course is just pulling the knowledge without basic logic i have no idea what i have learned	0
this course could do with harder assignments this last one was just run my code and screenshot stuff learned a lot though	3
really disappointed you have to pay to be able to do the quizzes i thought the whole point of coursera is to enhance our skills for free and chose to pay for a certificate if we wanted to	0
fun learning 	3
the course is excellent but there is mistakes in quiz and the forum participation is null professor nor your staff reply the forums	2
the videos were helpful but too fast not a lot of time is spent on any of the functions of f swirl helps but not a lot	1
have fall in love with negotiation	3
very useful ideas and concepts to use in everyday life	3
the instructor speaks too slow teaching concepts that are not valid anymore eg prefer inline over function call const vs define declaring variable anywhere in the code etcthe topics are too small and too much time is devoted to them	1
found it boring and pretty irrelevant i was hoping to lean more on metrics especially in the digital marketing section pretty let down and  waste	1
above the average score	2
seemed like a filler nit are why this was included	1
a nice little course which i felt has changed my perspective on how to be an effective learner certainly i will be experimenting with the techniques in the course in my own learning	3
no ta staff or instructor presence during the whole course students are left to their own devices	1
difficult to understand not a good explainer	0
grate class for any beginner with no programming background or python knowledge helped me to understand key basic concepts will be nice if you guys provide more exercises to practice and tougher questions	3
this course was a really good surprise a nice way to end  and start  i was scared cause of language once im not a native speaker so that was an extra challenge for me but everyone here helped the mentor was great and always ready to help the peers were nice and always giving tips of how i could improve the script and now i dont look to celtx program like a seven heads monsters anymore actually it is really easy to work on it im really glad i did this course	4
amazing and very useful course for any part of live	4
too simple and boring	1
the course was interesting and low maintenance the lectures could have been snappier and more to the point	3
professors need to undergo a presentation and instruction design skills they were talking a lot and everything was going over my head the reason was there were not visual prompt for the examples specifically in the last week	0
the course laid out the concepts pretty well but if one had access to the materials the lectures were not really necessary to understand the conceptsthis was because the lectures were pretty much a rereading of the materials and more importance could be placed on creating scenarios where the processes would be applicable this would be a far better use of the lecture time than trying to combine the two and not doing a good job of either	2
it is too hard to understand what he is saying his accent is impossible to follow besides the lectures are not dynamic it is just him reading the slides with the most monotonous and boring voice ever i took the first course of the specialization with david and this is the complete opposite i would love to see the whole  courses with david and not only the first one	0
i already have an masters degree in archaeology and this course provides a great course and insight in digital archaeology the one thing i missed from this course was several weeks with photogrammetry	4
i got more out of this course than i expected to and it was effective in introducing me into the basics of html our instructor colleen van lent did a fantastic job of explaining the content and encouraging the class to study and practice individually and collectively	4
short and crisp course on design thinking  a good crash course and introduction to a few design thinking innovation tools that can be applied in practice almost immediately after the course is completed practical but it can do with some more case studies and deliberate discussion questions every week to keep the discussion board focused and engaged	3
cyber security is miniscule in the topic mobility poses severe cyber security threat and syllabus is talking about mdm which is for compliance and cyber security	1
unclear assignments unfit for an international participant base	0
i really enjoyed this course it threw me at first that the whole course was only lectures  no videos or readings  but so much of this course will be applicable to teaching biology that its useful no matter what i also had a small problem with verifying quizzes on my phone	3
too short too simple too theoretici found of little interest the slides partially interesting the swirl exercise interesting the programming assignmenti would like to have a longer course with more practical examples	1
great course	4
ive done a few online courses on various and for me this is poor the content is gratingly simplified the delivery worse the instructions for the assignments are impenetrable at best unfortunately i cant gain those moments that ive spent on this course back	0
the information in the videos was very interesting and well presented i feel like i learned a lot however the quizzes and tests seemed to be of a very different level and often covered material that was hardly discussed in the lectures i understand that students are expected to do independent learning of material but the gulf between lectures and test difficulty was extreme if others were interested in learning about the basics of music theory i would not recommend this course	1
better than the data scientists toolbox but not a great introduction to r when im learning a new language i dont want to know about data types and for loops a detailed example showing the strengths of this language would be better	1
this is less of a university level course and more of a long infomercial for michael pollen books with a cooking show at the endthere is no interviews with nutritionists or scientists in fact there really isnt much here in the way of science at allthe cooking videos are fun with some good recipes	1
very watered down	0
i think its too little amount of material it is very shame that there arent any exercise after each week	2
extremely basicthe assignments would be easy except that the provided code has bugs and some of the assignment details are wrong making it very difficult to pass the test casesthere is also very little information on how the work will be graded	1
awesome course on ethics of journalism and also describes how to gain the trp news channel or websites etc sensationalize the news	3
good explanations by a teacher that knows a lot about the subject it was a big learning for me	4
the course gave good beginning to r programming it will be good if you can add more examples use cases real time scenariosexplaining where that function can be used when you teach assignments are of good standard they made me to learn more about r overall it gave a good exposure if possible add one mini project kind of thing along with assignments	3
the first  weeks are really good  stars weeks  and  are way too light week  has no programming assignment and a short class and  has a weak programming assignment and no class	2
in my honest opinion the quality of this course is not that high you can expect to learn some basic syntax of swift and thats about it there are very little material each week and then you get a quiz which is not the best form of examination nor for learning i do not recommend this course	1
loved the pace and check in quizzes like a classroom	4
this course is not so good a lot of things are just come from the instructors head without correcting reference from high quality literature he can say whatever he think is right but i would not say all animals do not have complex language systems or we have one single origin of language i would also suggest the instructor to interview more worldfamous linguists not just play simple ask and answer with his studentsthe examples of different languages in the later weeks are interesting but somehow i expect some better understanding of more aspects of languages in general i would say it still has so much space for improvement i would not recommend anyone to spend time on learning this course	0
i wouldve saved a lot of time by knowing the r commands used in this course it took so long to figure out things and i i didnt like the course because of that	1
all this course justified one class at top	1
short video but the content is comprehensive and easy to understand highly recommended for those who want to understand the ways of the music industry	4
very nice overview of what can go wrong in a data science project and what to pay attention to	3
nothing really new very good for newbies in the field short and easy to handle presentations and topics	1
waste money and time do not explain very well	0
excellent course talking about the fundamentals of machine learning definitely worth the time and effort i would have given it a  if it had any information on how to handle non numerical data like categorical or text features	3
great introduction information for newcomers  thank you	4
the certificate is paid it should offer a free version of some kind	3
it was interesting to a point but there was no application of the knowledge gained it was merely a regurgitation of facts	0
very well planned course	3
good start with tableau you will also get a license that is good for a year license worth 	4
only one star as it was not made clear you could also get  points in assignments noted as ties but no further explanation i dont think i will bother with part 	0
teacher has difficulties speaking english and is really distracting that has bad audio in some of the lessons poor quality overall	1
the assignments in this course take much more time than indicated feedback from staff is minimal if you are not a good programmer think twice nevertheless the lectures are interesting and well taught so if you do not want a certicficate i recommend this	1
even though i would have liked something more handson this subject matter doesnt come naturally to me i was able to complete the course and obtain a certificate i appreciate all the efforts that went into this online course and recommend it to other computer programming newbies	4
more about the study of terrorism than about terrorism	1
awesome course thank you for putting it up together	4
the interviews are excellent this is a very thoughtprovoking class however all of the assignments are written and there is one very week might not be the ideal workload for busy people but the lectures are worth taking the course	3
i managed to complete this course but that was because of my four years of mooclevel programming experience and duckduckgo google not because of the course material videos are dull readings of the pdfs with many ummmms and annoying lipclicks examples are useless explanations are often vague or even incomplete the assignments are relatively hard in that you dont get all the necessary info from the course sometimes even rs own manpages arent enough which is a shame as youd expect a course to teach you how to use the tools you will need for the assignmentsif you have no programming experience stay away from this courseotherwise if you want to learn r look for other resources and save yourself some time and money	0
this course is very greatit has more knowledge but through the course is fun that me make me concentrate during learning with out boredom	4
the topic was interesting  but most of the questions need to be rewritten	2
for a beginners course i would expect more exercises about the different control structures and builtin mechanisms in python this course did not really provide a good story to follow through but jumped around between loops inputs number conversions file io and so forth	0
its a  week course thats not particularly difficult or creative with the assessments	0
it was very hard for me to learn i am not good at javascript	1
in my pointofview this course is an excellent introduction to the field of machine learning  this course will be really helpful for the people who are eager to know what machine learning is like thanks to profandrew ng  the tas for making it possible for everybody in getting to know about this great field called machine learning	4
much more emphasis on statistical analysis than on experimental design seems out of place with the rest of the specialization in terms of both length and subject matter course assessments seem to test indepth knowledge of coding in r which isnt gone over in sufficient detail in lectures rather students are told to look it up in more detail on their own however the class is already longer and more indepth than all the others in the specialization more so than experimental design or statistics should be less detailed or split into multiple courses or at least should have an introductory lessons or prerequisite course on basics of how r works  i found it extremely frustrating trying to learn about and conduct statistical analyses in a system of which i had only minimal working knowledge	0
this is not for beginners at all	0
too much statistics too much coding and inadequate instruction this is not a coding specialization and if i wanted to learn coding i would have taken a coding course this  weeks course has been a nightmare	0
the course is excellent for beginners	4
this is by far the best online learning course i learned so much from prof andrew ng i really appreciate it could have been better if we wrote all the codes from scratch but that would have taken longer time much informative next is to learn python and the sckitlearn libraries i prefer octave and matlab because you actually see and understand the algorithm and the basics of it its not widely used though but very powerful thanks again	4
very good and hight quality video  more exemple step by step i like this cousre	4
overall not a bad course needs some tidying up though for example the assignments seem to assume knowledge of functions not covered in the prior lessons same applies to the textbook eg page  refers to the subset function but it is not actually covered	2
very fantastic class for zeroexperienced studentsmr professor is very humorous which makes the course even more interesting and easy to learn	4
excellent course for beginners and specialists alike i have worked with students with learning difficulties for over  years and still found the information presented in this course to be up to date practical and very informative the tutors vincent and jenny are extremely prepared and knowledgeable they make the information easily accessible and relevant for those who work with students with difficulties the course staff is quick to respond to any queries i highly recommend the course for anyone interested in specialist work or supporting students	4
i wish that the videos were longer	2
fantastic course thank you	4
just reading there are not videosyou are not allowed to submit the quiz if you do not pay	0
nice courselearned new thingsprofessor describe all things very well	3
excellent class with a rich variety of instructors from multidisciplinary array of fields lots of extra information and pretty much any question answered	4
moderator answer in a very short time i was impressed of that i think the course should add a video to explain more in details some concept as variables many of my issues were coming from deep doubts i had about this maybe explain variables on hardware and variables as pointers	2
interesting and educative course recommended for every management staff	3
its a very dry course the material is very limited and the coverage has to be more lively with some some relevant examples	0
poor quality and even worse presentation by the teacher	0
the course has been very structured very focused yet has all the depth of a very complex problem bravo	4
aimed at those needing to get services  in a spectrum of family living too much on california systems not enough on direct coping with daytoday	1
the course materials and the topic of interest is fantastic dr erickson does a great job explaining the fundamentals of power switching technologies and the homework greatly tests a participants knowledge of the subject matter and forces the user to really digest the material my only critique is i wish the homework solutions would be shared after the homework due dates so that one could learn from	3
good course for me but area need to be improved is the course navigation	3
i like this mam teaching	2
one suggestion i give to you that please level of difficulty increase in a way that the learner not face to much thing in a single assignment so create assignment like that learner learn less thing but accurately for example in this assignment you only build a relations between classes and marker on a map for only citymarkermapjava class and in the next module you implement landmarkerjava and so on so please this is my request in the future make assignments in a way that the learner less thing but efficiently and accurately	1
a good handon course to initiate you into the world of social digital marketing	3
quiz was not well structured and title suggested a different idea than what the course was really about its a teachers guide	1
poor presentation unclear points not a detailed walk through about the specific tool	1
very short not good it doesnt give anything about entrepreneurship	0
very well structure the quiz was admirably hard but satisfying to work through and solve you made me think outside the box excellent	3
most of the lectures were very rushed and brief they quote facts and names and rarely bother to elaborate on them the interviews that often serve as a second lecture for the week mostly repeat the first lecture average duration for both   minutesalmost no reading materials in englishthe translations in english isnt very goodthe peer review processes for the final assignment is flawed since you will be given to review works in spanish and english with no option toskip to an essay in a language you understand the grading criteria is also flawed for example the required length of the essay does not seem to be obligatorythe staff rarely bothers with answers in the discussion forumall in all it is an interesting topic and a good starting point for your own research sadly it is one of the worst courses i have taken part in	1
great course	4
do this course for the assignments and to have something that keeps you on schedule but be prepared to do your own research on topicsthe professor goes off on pointless tangents forever c is also supposed to be a prerequisite but then he ends also ends up explaining basic c prefixing his explanation with you should know this he then goes into these very specific typical academicstyle examples that he spends time talking about them again pointless and then very little time is left to explain the actual new c stuff and he explains it assuming you kindof know what hes talking about so youll have to stop the video and look up the topic online	2
short and impactful videosextramaterials of each lessons are very useful and helpful	4
the course was very informative and interesting  i had a tough time doing the assignments but it was worth learningdefinitely a interesting insight into the building blocks of a computer	3
im leaving because i cant keep up with an  week course given in  weeks and even less if the course keep on refering to the  weeks time frame a pity i loved this course	2
it is very interesting course for those who wants to know about entrepreneurship from scratch the practical examples will enrich you to get the right concept worth studying	4
this is my first experience with an online training program i found that the way the course to be very well structures and well documented to allow for learning and assimilatopn of the subject dr charles make this stimulating and motivating to go deeper and make the whole thing fun and productive	3
very unclear in the way it was presented and the subject that are being talked about and not very interesting partly because it was to easy for me	0
a very challenging course for a beginner but if you are ready to invest time and effort you will definitely manage it a point that should definitely be mentioned is that the course is not selfsufficient so to speak you will need to do a lot of additional research googling ask questions on forums and maybe even take additional courses in parallel in order to make it to the end but once that steep learning curve is overcome you will enjoy all the benefits and above all will be wellarmed to continue in the specialization	3
a lot of info is packed into this course i have some javascript background so it helped if you have none you should start on an earlier course loved the exerciseschallenging but not out of reach would take another course from this instructor	4
great course i learned a lot of valuable information i can use in my work the course is not for the beginner best if you already have exposureexperience with htmlcss and javascript still then youll need to do your own online research  stars 	4
the instructor just rambles on and on there is no structure to the lectures	0
this is a good course a thorough introduction to ruby on rails	2
the course seems to be useful but the tasks become hell you need either give more information and examples or decrease the complexity of the questions and tasks	1
good introductory course provides hands on experience with toy examples that helps to better understand the content light on math so should appeal to a wider base i completed the course in a couple of days lecturers are very good with clear exposition of material in most modules the weakest part was discussion of deep learning but it is hard to fault the course providers since their aim was to provide an overview of the field really looking forward to rest of the courses in the specialization to gain more in depth understanding	3
good course but not good from coursera to not give honor certificate like it used to giveedx still givesvery disappointed with coursera	0
a very well taught and approachable course i highly recommend it	4
excellent intro to statistical molecular thermodynamics	4
great course	4
provides fantastic understanding of how the brain works in relation to learning	4
thanks for providing this wonderful course	3
very basic rather simple	1
sometimes i dont understand when the lecture gives some examples of an abstract concept	2
the lectures are excellent but do not take this course if you are not already proficient in a graphing package whether its r python or something else much more sophisticated than excel otherwise you will be faced with the painfully frustrating task of learning a package while trying to complete an assignment all with a short deadline	0
this course fills a gap that is rarely taught by explaining biological origins of musical experiences the material is very easy to follow i wish there were more practical exercises or home works to play with the concepts	2
great coursemr lagerstrom thank you very much for giving us your insight about special theory of relativity and more generally for your learning initiative 	4
very good level excellent teacher	4
i am just over half way of this course but already convinced that this is the best introduction to moocs i could dream of not only is the subject clearly explained by barbara oakley and her team the way your progress is measured and presented helps students to stay on track i would have given five stars if the mooc offered more formative tests and a wider variety of questions and assignments	3
its a good course those who prefer to study onlineit gives a basic knowledge about the data tools which are going to be used	3
there are no clearly defined learning outcomes at the start of each video which are cramped with stats and facts and statements such as you will learn more about this in mooc  and this will be talked about extensively in mooc  as a learner its confusing to know what to take out of each videothe extend to which students are used to promote the course by prompting them to tweet about the videos is a concern ones or twice is okay but every timethe assignment is a miss  students should be given a choice whether they want to focus on marketing their professional personas or marketing their businessi can summarize mooc  in one sentence social media is big and therefore business must change the way they do marketing	0
very good practical just to the point with lots of quotes and evidence on studies that suppport course affirmations really enjoyable	3
its a very interesting course demands study and it has some real life examples that may be really useful nevertheless it could work on more actionable tools for the daily management	3
capstone was great although i would have learnt stuff better if there was a small battle from the deadlines and the curriculum in particular this was a fun specialization and am looking forward to graduate soon thanks dr chuck cheers	2
this course taught me how to program	4
trivial course this week course can be easily completed in an houri learned nothing from this course that i did not already know about pythonthis course is strictly for beginners	0
this course is good but too far from the real content this specialisation look for or at least i was expecting	1
i quit this course in the th week and i hope my following points are seen as constructive and help the owners to improve the experience on the plus side this course presents some nice correlations between bible and babylonion sources quizzes are too hard if you miss a single piece of information you cant complete it due to a outof selection question every week which you have to answer correctly after reviewing all videos of week  twice i quit lectures often lack a continuous thread to follow back and forward jumps in time are common timelines at the end sometimes help but are shown too late the forum is abandoned to the point of time there are three  posts in the forum and none of the forum operators no one is taking care of it the lecturers english is not good but understandable sometimes with unusual choice of words	0
good first steps in project management	3
the lecture was very abstract and difficult i could pass the course somehow by writing the code presented in the lecture but i must say i understand less than the half of the course contentsresponding to question from the instructor i clarify the comments abovei found the whole lecture difficult this may be because the subject is not something i have even thought about it was difficult to understand the difference and importance of key concepts such as trie suffix class etc overall i learned that the tricks somehow work but my comprehension was not as deep as i can think about the extension or applications i guess more examples or providing intuition would help me to digest the material	2
although very interesting this course seemed too short for meprofessor kofman is an expert in the filed but he mostly reads thewords on the slides and shows little or no passion or interest in sharing hisideas and work whatsoever	2
cool very complete introduction	3
as i feel basic courses should be open and free whereas advance courses can be chargeable it is not worth the money to pay for basic course it should atleast be open in audit mode if it cant be made completely free	4
i requested for a refund and i did not receive it i guess i wont get it until about  weeks i want a refund because its too easy this is stuff i learned in freshman biology its nice that it offers resources and links however i wanted to take a course and get a certificate in one at my level to prove that i can learn beyond a high school biology level and the course says its for educators but it doesnt go into much detail on how to actually teach the information i guess this is good if you want to be a substitute at a middle school or high school but its not for me i was looking for something that was more so at a college level also on the important information they sort of skim over sometimes im  im not in school because i dont want to waste thousands of dollars on stuff thats elementary so i dont think i could get any special benefits and get courses for free but thats also the reason why im on here but im disappointed to have wasted  dollars if they arent going to refund me i can barely afford  dollars im unemployed and no one will hire i wanted to take a course in something that would at least get me some kind of job or volunteer work within my field of interest seriously not even these minimum wage jobs will hire you if you didnt go or arent going to college just wanted to feel like i accomplished something suited to my level	0
i truly enjoy this course because i am using the knowledge i acquire during the lectures and applying it to complete assignments instead on relying on quizzes along to gauge my understanding the assignments are based on real world examples	4
the teacher lacks the ability of mathematical description including clearing defining concepts describing everything in mathematical languages and showing math formulas of ttests she hopes to hide everything behind the canvas and just show how statistics are applied but without enough mathematics nothing she said makes sense i have to search on the internet to get to know what she didnt teachfrom a math phd	0
its complete and very helpful to get you going and familiarized with the unity editor	3
this is the best course that ive ever taken and i highly recommend it prof andrew ng is a fantastic teacher	4
very good course	3
i enjoyed learning about how to create a vitamin rich unit of fiction and the importance of specific words	3
it is so usefulespecially the professor will teach you how to cook and i felt so hunger when i was watching	3
really loved the structure of the coursejohn kellogs lectures are even though they are a bit boring in the initial stages they are very important and they create an life long impact on you if you try to focusi love the way how berklee professors just carry the whole course just sitting with a black backgroundit needs great skills and experience to have such confidence in presenting a lecture like thatim always thankful to coursera for providing this educational courses coursera and berklee college of music for life	3
this session was too long and a little boring could be shorter with the related contents	2
it is good but for an introduction its too long	1
this course is mostly theory based and certainly not what i am expected	1
needed more depth	2
one of the worst courses i have taken on coursera i have been in it for  years and expected a lot more in this course there were a couple times that the instructor was inaccurate about a some of the concepts he was teaching	1
the classes are sometimes extremely boring and some things are not clearly explained	1
a very good class for english language teachers	3
i am dropping this course dont email any more for this course how do i unroll in this course	0
i wish programming assignments were a little more indepth otherwise a great course exceeded my expectations	3
pretty good course for a beginner	4
simple but informational	3
i had a great and much needed introductiontiffany b	2
i think most of code should write enrolled students how can you learn something just copying lines of code and making minor changes or just running already wrote code like in the last section	2
presenter is very bad lecturer she seems to be reading badly from a tele prompt rather than lecturing the quality of the slides is very poor not the level of a reputable university	0
very informative	2
i thought this was poor it was basically a rehash of the previous module with slightly different tasks given that i had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready i found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks dont waste your moneytime on this particular module	0
poor compared with some of the others on this specialisation the lectures are too fast and high level with no allowance given for people who are unfamiliar with this area and attempting to learn it	0
very useful and thought provoking course	3
never thought i would be interested in philosophy  that was the start of my adventure	3
difficult one but made it	3
so close but yet so far course concepts are interesting and the programming assignments are fun but the presentation can be greatly improvedcriticisms includei the course isnt self contained physical concepts like resultant moment inertial and bodyfixed frame and torque are used without definition mechanics is not listed as a prerequisite but it should beii lectures are very mathematical but proofs intuition and good problem sets are all missing listening to a math lecture without doing challenging problems or deriving mathematical results to build intuition can be a waste of time check out john cochranes asset pricing  and  or tim roughgardens algo  and  for great examples of thoughtful problem sets and intuitive derivationsiii way too much powerpoint speed reading a static powerpoint slide overloaded with dense mathematical formulas without using pointers or animations to focus the students attention is a recipe for confusion and frustration i find hand written derivations even when the handwriting is a little sloppy much easier to follow than a static page of formulas plus a sound track hand written derivations impose a natural pace and focal point to the content check out gilbert strangs linear algebra sebastian thruns artificial intelligence for robotics and andrew ngs machine learning for examples of good derivations of mathematically sophisticated materialiv the programming assignments while fun were somewhat ad hoc and disconnected from the lecture material specifically the main task of every single assignment was to hand tune a pd controller no systematic approach was ever described for performing this task	0
very interested information but i thought that the focus was for other thing instead a guitar amplifier	3
it is an excellent review of breast cancer field i enjoyed it very much thanks very much to everyone who prepared the course	4
this will probably be the worst course in the specialization and for good reason the entire course is designed to overload you with terminology to get you up to speed for the follow courses as a result this is a pretty bland and boring  weeks the assignments feel like tedious filler an a lot of the questions in them are very poorly worded the saving grace is that the course is just  weeks and can be completed in a fairly short amount of time	1
i like the course and really enjoyed studying	4
very bogus and boring content the monotonous voice gets me	0
the content is good and easy to follow but lack depth	2
i learned very little from the course the tests were easy but thats because there was little to be learned	0
this was a decent overview of fp principals but a poor introduction to the scala language in fact the requirements should just come out and state that you must have prior scala knowledge to most thoroughly appreciate the course the last  assignments may have been ok for  hours doubtful for someone with scala experience but they really should be marked more appropriately for time for those of us new to scala id say  hours easily more than that for the last assignmentalso no slides or related handouts are provided if you remember seeing something on one of the slides shown youll have to look back scanning through all the videos trying to find it this is a very poor way to manage course content  forcing students to rely solely on the videosim left feeling ive only learned a smattering here and there of scala and dont think ill take the remainder of the specialization as i had intended	2
thanks dr matthew youre the bestmr marco i didnt understand anything from you and i stopped the course because i dropped this module because of you im sorry	0
very interesting but i found it a little bit confusing	2
amazing insights on how the new world of digital is evolving	4
great start good examples and a very nice way to crash into data sc	3
there is no instruction with this course if youve never written a script before youre not going to get a lot of help here other than researching things yourself which you can do without this course not to mention the feedback is minimal and not all that helpful for example if ive never written a script what value am i to someone else who has also never written a script and what value is their feedback to me i signed up to get some experience and to also get feedback from those more experienced than i im less interested in what my peers have to say and more interested in the feedback of the instructor who has years more experience than most of us to pass assignments off of  or  peer reviews is worthless theres no value in that what does the instructor think would he pass us he occasionally drops a line in the discussion forum but no direct feedback to the studentsi think this class should have a cap on enrollment so that the instructor can actually review and provide feedback to the students jokes on anyone paying  to essentially teach yourself this guys just sits back and moderates when he canthe best thing about this class is that it does force you to write but beyond that its not helpful at all truly disappointing	0
while i really enjoyed the first module i was less impressed by this one have the course is very basic while the rest is just too brief and not practical enough i will however continue with the courses and expect the next module to build on the one reviewed here	2
great course 	4
a very good and thought provoking courseit is a rerun of an archived course and sadly a number of reference materials that had been on the dashboard are not reposted with it also there are references to discussion forums that dont exist if the missing material and content were up to date it would be a strong and complete course	1
not interactive enough	2
nothing new and no challenging exercises it could be more interactive	0
i wish it could be harder and have more challenging quizzes than simply arithmetic and multiple choice	2
i didnt know how to make cashflow assumptions also instructor jumps from one lesson to another without enough explanation how did he reach to the solution	1
not upto the marknot meant for intelligent students	0
arguments that sound very unconvincing and unscientific	0
the only thing i had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python  code to  as thats what im usingpresentations didnt add much towards the learning either definite downgrade from previous courses especially from the first three	1
great course it would be better if the course provide more problems that is not directly the implementation of what is taught	4
the programming assignments are very well organized and give a good sense of the working principles of the algorithms also the course enforces the reflection on how to potentialize the application of specific algorithms	4
good content but the communication is not so great	2
its a excellent course all the content and the teacher excellent	4
unprecedented high speaking speed	0
the course was good but what disappointed me was that the assignments were more focused on java script and less iot also the lectures were short and fast at times the instructor would move thru the demos so quick or show pages and not provide a detail description of what we were looking at making things very confusing at times for example i would look at the screen he was showing on the services running or docs and i was like where do i find this in bluemix and what does all these nodes services etc mean none of that was explained and if they were it was at a very high level the assignments were not honest with the time estimates not sure about the others but i must have spent countless hours and nights working on these with little guidance or direction which would have saved me countless of wasted hours the forums were not monitored frequently and when i got responses they were late as by that time i figured my issues or some of the suggestions offered were cryptic not giving me any hints or letting me know if my approach was in the right directioneither way this course is very hard to do while also working on a full time job and travelling with those aspects i hope that the forums are monitored by the instructors for a quick feedback loop and the lectures are updated to be more detailed the only way i was able to finish this was because i worked  hours each day and late night and all weekends trying to make sure i finish by the end deadline the last thing i wanted was this being monkey on my back for the next few more weeksthe positive is that i learned about bluemix offerings and lastly i can play around now with the raspberry pi and do some real iot and less java scripting	2
final quiz is too hard to take  too much questions haha	4
im honestly quite pissed the material itself is fine but i have had a terrible experience working with the instructors i dont think i will continue taking these coursesi dont appreciate the amount of time and effort given into the programming assignments only to receive practically zero help first of all i dont know why im failing the test cases i just am your program runs through maybe  tests to ensure correctness but somehow the instructors decide you should only see the first  but then i try posting on the forums to receive help only to have it removed quite frankly i have spent well over  hours at this point on a single problem and ive created my own tests and i have looked at all the very vague hints given in the forums and i still have no clue what to do i have school a job and yet im losing all this productivity because im running all these damn tests hoping on the offchance that i catch whatever weird bug it is thats failing my code all i want is real concrete feedback	0
should cover a lot of dfificuties when the model assumptions are violated and should be for a longer time or having a second course about this theme	1
not too good because in assignments session they doesnt know what the right ans is as in first assignment the ques is about circumference of circle as in google the exact ans is what they wronged it	0
it was too basic for me	0
some good information but very much a political course not much of an economics course stating as if it is a given late in the course that there are times when it is okay to introduce a moral hazard erroneously defining fiat money early in the course stating again as if it were a given that deficit spending is naturally the right answer to a crisis when politicians and their pawns develop a course should we be surprised that the answer is always more government intervention oh if only we had more tools to stop this never realizing their role in creating the crisis	1
it seemed like the assignments didnt really follow the videos and such im coming from a python background and am totally new to cc i spent close to   hr days trying to figure out how to code a simple readwrite to eeprom  this specialization really needs to spend equal time on the programming aspect	1
this course is definitely not for beginners you must have intermediate to advanced knowledge of statistics and math i had to resort to google and khan academy extensively just to grasp the concepts in this course this course also does not teach you everything about excel let alone master it you just refer to pre made excel sheets for quizzes thats it good luck figuring those out	0
this course should be taught as a requirement at all universities to all language learners please learn how to learn do not waist your time on silly strategies this is the way i should have been taught all along thank you for this opportunity	4
worst course of the specialization	0
a lot of information and very well presented may need some updating to reflect the quickly changing landscape of terrorism thanks for a great course	3
the content is simple i think the course is just for watching during the break	1
i loved the elaborate structure but they should provide a certificate	3
too easy very basic	1
i thought the lessons were really boring there are some interesting aspects about it but its hard to concentrate pat pattinson couldnt get me hooked up all the time	1
the whole course is basically a short topic based phrasebook being readout and overexplained in english since i already speak english this isnt very useful the course contains no dialogues or any real situations where vocabs being reviewed i found the exercise nitpicky and confusing and theres no indication nor review of what actually you did wrong better just use an audiophrasebook and repeat it using the same time	1
if your goal is to just get a certificate to put on your resume this specialization will check the box the assignments are poorly thought out overly rigid for requiring very specific methods and mediums and the peer review system is kind of a joke if youre sincerely interested in learning ixd and creating a high quality portfolio piece this course is moderately helpful toward that end but youll need to supplement it with lots of outside reading and in person coursework to really get where you want to be if youre weighing whether to attend an inperson course or program or go with this specialization to save some  just know that youll get what you pay for	1
this course is very useful i recommend it for everyone i love it	4
no technical support is provided for vm issues	2
very very introductory course	3
when you finish the course you wont be able to print out your certificate so dont even waste your time with this bs website i am beyond pissed rn and im reporting this to everyone this a real comment about this course too	0
almost a useless course  ml overview using knime which gives no insight whatsoever	1
prof ngs approach shows us how world class universities can help anyone to scale up easily i would like to thank you prof ng mentors coursera and stanford university	4
great course strongly recommend to you guys to take	4
a little bit tediousmonotonous course it has some useful tips and tests for beginners in personal time managment	1
not a positive act to make people pay to be able to participate in the quizzes the other audited classes allow everyone to participate in everything we just do not become certified if we have taken the class for audit rather than credit	0
kind of basic about the writing stuff i wish it work more about audience and characteristics of each age very useful the second part of the course about editing	2
i enjoyed the topic the lectures could be augmented by breaking them up into more pieces particularly for instrumental variables and double difference it would have been nice if additional optional readings were listed to give interested students more direction i also would have liked to see topics added to the course such as propensity score matching	2
assignments are not well prepared forms are not helping either people accomplishing the assignment or the people reviewing their workwe have to go back and forth to review the question answered in both cases when fillingout or reviewing and sometimes notation criteria are not clear upfrontplease review the assignments and improve them because it was really frustrating	1
excessive use of graphlab create which is not an industry standard	1
i cannot spend  per year package just to learn this course sorry i am off	0
i would have liked the course to have been more hands on i would have also liked to have seen other platforms utilizedexhypothetical situations to apply course content togroup assignments with real time chatbetter formatted supplemental readings to compliment the lecture videosalso i feel like the instructors failed to explain some of the business jargon used which wasnt remedied by referencing the dictionary	2
it very useful for me i can link presentation with myself	3
there is a lot of selfteaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions in addition the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding at times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code this is definitely not a beginner coder course and i do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before	3
just like other university of maryland online courses  boring	0
useful as a necessary step towards finishing the specialization only	0
this course is not well moderated the material is confusing and the quizzes were not tested before uploading them onto coursera this specialization is definitely not on par with other specializations i have donebluf there are better uses for your money and time	0
good in depth knowedge	2
nice high level overview of the motion of robots i would have liked to do more programming modeling of robots controllers etc in the course and have the lectures tie in closer with the content of the quizzes the tas were very active in the forums and helped clarifyfix any problems that came up	2
this course is very good to start algorithmic coding	4
course advertised incorrectly this course is more on the electronics and embedded systems end of iot as opposed to a highlevel perspective	0
i found the course rather difficult with respect to the other courses i did on coursera in my opinion part of the reason i found it difficult is that the material is not explained very well hinton is certainly a guru in machine learning but i found him a bit boring as a teacher and often i thought he was explaining some details but failing to give the broader picture i must admit i did not read the extra material provided with the course the long articles but only focused on the videos slides and tests perhaps had i read the articles i would have struggled less i also did the course in  weeks instead of  but i did watch most videos twice so i feel i did dedicate some time to it i much preferred andrew ngs course and i strongly recommend doing that one first i am also loving the university of washingtons machine learning specialization but since i have been wating for the next course in that specialization for a while i did hintons course in the mean time that said i did find this course useful although i often felt somewhat frustrated	1
not a course for beginners	1
the material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging but the course is not well prepared the assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials eg downloadable slideshandouts available to assist in learning	1
i really enjoyed this course an interesting mix of history philosophy and psychology i enjoyed the written assignments as it made me think harder about the course material than just passing the quizzes reviewing others work was fascinating too as it made me consider things from different points of view though i do think the reviewing criteria wouldve benefitted from being just a little bit more detailed to better reflect the huge variation in standard between submissionsim very much looking forward to the next module	4
like the toolbox and this casestudy pattern	4
this course successfully covers the mechanics and control topics of quadrotors the course also points to some resources in order to extend your study on uavs however there are some issues concerning the assignments which i didnt like at all big gap in difficulty between assignments of first three weeks compared with the assignment of the fourth week the difficulty of the assignments of the first three weeks just relied on sweeping somewhat smartly a  or  dimensional parametric space i guess that real uavs engineers are not paid for this in some assignment i had to edited a file which i was not supposed to edit in order to pass it the last assignment was quite frustrating for the following reasonsa really long running times to test if the parameters work fine i would sacrifice the fancy realtime visualization to save some time apart from long running times i guess that uavs are not solving odes in real time on board so i think is more interesting a more practicalrealtime approachb search in a dimensional parametric space some parameters are equal but still you end up tunning  independent parameters which influence each other come on is this useful i am sure that uavs engineers dont spend their hours in this kind of crappy search you could explain at least some existing heuristics when having so many control parameters to tunec even though the drone trajectory seems to fit perfectly the planned trajectory you might not pass the exercise and you would get some clueless messages telling you the final positionvelocity is not correctd the assignment guide is very unclear in some partse a lot of typos in the formulas of the last part of the guide i decided to completely ignore it and develop my own strategy which turned out to be far simpler and easier to implementf the submission program tests the whole exercise regardless you passed some sections or not which make the waiting times even longer	1
complete idiot he doesnt have any critical view of his field which is unfortunately full of crappy studies also i hope he didnt choose the logo from his university its a good metaphor for the course though shiny but absolutely ridiculous	0
a little bit too much generalist need more precisionand unlimited attempt for quizz is not a godd idea because quizz dont mean anything	2
very helpful and inspiring course dr mcgarrity with a great sense of humor give all the support needed to get over your fears to stand up in front of a lens and to deliver a selfconfidence speech but more important he gives a great example and guideline on how to prepare it highly recommended mooc	3
simple and direct just the way it should	4
good introductory course	3
well it is a fairly good introduction to chinese its short and easy however i expected much more from the course	2
the quality of the presentation is very low and way below the quality in other courses the assignments are very poorly designed this is not a subjective personal experience this is based on discussions with other learners in the forum who have expressed disappointment and frustration	0
total disappointment this was only clipping through a tool not a real capstone project	0
typography is an important part of graphic designthis course will give a brief introduction to the historical context of typography and the evolution of typography in this modern computerized agea great course for those interested in graphics design and can be used as a refresher for the working professionals	4
difficulties streaming	2
very basic i hoped for a more advanced level	1
professors accent very hard to understand week s lesson should be reviewed as may have no place in class	1
positive approach to the topics is solid readings are very valuablenegative some videos in week  and  have audio issues course should had a template with the course objectives learning outcomes and grading scheme  out of  quizzes didnt allow to see which questions were right or wrong social media resources such as a linkedin group for the specialization would add value but the most negative aspect was not having the slides a lot of the topics covered were presented very fast and not having the slides to review the materials made my experience in learning very frustrating i note that also the course critical perspectives on management had the same problems with the quizzes and also did not provide slides what was somewhat frustrating also also if ie is making an effort to become more relevant in this online space it should allocate human resources to monitor and interact in the discussion forums in my opinion there are a lot of opportunities to improve the student experience what i found somewhat because being this a series of courses in marketing a lot of these issues had to been fixedaddressed before the course startednonetheless my critics  which i expect to be considered as constructive critics it is important to thank ie and coursera for continuing providing online coursesi wish you luckricardo j oliveira	2
this course is excellent i really like the stepbystep approach and i find the explanations behind each notion extremely helpful	4
instructors tend to talk too fast and read off the slides verbatim instead of thoroughly explaining the topic	2
assignment  was absolutely ridiculous in the sense that the implementation of pandas functions depended on data cleaning in the first step for which there was no help  no response from peers or moderators on my queries had high hopes when i joined the course i feel cheated now because of some issues with the data cleaning step all my following answers were incorrect and i couldnt pass the course in time	0
interesting content but explanations are less clear with respect to the other courses of the ml specialization	2
somehow simple presentations	1
very good course cover the necessary topics	3
a little bite long regarding the concepts number developped in this course	2
this course is bit disappointing because of the way it has been presented ideally the speaker should focus on detailing the points highlighted in the slides but in this course the speaker is just passing on the same information which are there on slides without adding much value although i was deeply interested in this subject and would look forward to the revised version of the same	1
too many bugs with coursera issues occur with submissions system indicates submissions were successfully submitted then when you log back in it indicates your assignment is over due now i cant	0
really great course to pursue  robert has explained each concepts in great detail	4
poor content clearly filler material for the specialization 	0
gave basic introduction to design principles but the assignments were very engaging	3
much less technical than i had anticipated much more policydriven disappointing	0
it is a very good course however i must admit that is discouranging making the course because when you do the course free you do not have the opportunity to make all the excercises despite that it is very good	3
too little detail but nice course as an idea	2
very good introductory course to r programming	4
i think punctuacion is the main topic	2
nice course about eating suggestions and good recipesit could be useful giving details on how making a diet for children with information about calories they need and so on	2
this course covers very interesting topics but there are some serious shortcomings in the lectures too much information is just omitted or taken for granted some of the lecturers are rather inexperienced reading or reciting mathematical expressions in a monotonous voice without actually pointing to the visual representation of the lecture material makes it very difficult to follow better care should also be taken with the quizzes  if one looks at the comments or questions posted by some learners it is clear that we simply dont understand the question or a question is answered correctly in essence  but the quizz expected more or less precision without stating so  finally for some reason the support from technical advisors was also lacking in the specific session that i did contributing to my frustration and rather negative experience of what could be a very good course	1
outstanding way to understand our cognitive function some obvious stuff but still worthwhile	3
good and very nice	3
the course offers just a simple running of interesting and useful code but doesnt put the student in the situation of thinking and creating ideas and code	1
you dont really learn what you need from lectures while i agree part of the experience is having to search and figure things out yourself this goes beyond what i would expect i have a technical background heavy database data warehouse sql and coding and it was difficult for me i can just imagine if you didnt have a technical background	1
terriblecant believe how a quality the course is embarrassing	0
peer review is suboptimal	2
coursera does not want to give me a certificate ive got  for this course	0
good course	4
it needs project based exams not quizzes these project exams should be a combination of automated programming tasks like the kind you find on hackerrank or codeforces and peer assessment based projects that asks students to evaluate the readability of each others code as it currently stands this course is a joke	0
very good cours	4
inadequate student and teacher participation on forums leaving students to figure things out without assistance or collaboration insufficient explanation of math concepts required to fully understand lectures	1
really useful course covering the fundamentals of pricing and the common concepts in that field using both quantative methods and qualitative ones	4
the professor is very good however pictures and graphics mean a thousand words these lectures rely too much on words it makes it how to visualize the concepts hope to see more pictures animation will be the best	2
this is the rating for the whole specialization some course are nice and well done but probably only  of the  the entrepreneur one is really well done but most of them are simply useless its too long for the same amount of knowledge i could have done just  well done courses most of courses are just things people read in front of a screen without any passion or interest and the concept are so easy i am wandering if they need to be teached at all the exam are just sloppy even a monkey that didnt watch the video could answer them sometimes i try to do the same and it works if i already know what you will ask me which kind of knowledge are you supposed to teach me about this project the instructions are messed upin the end i finish it because it was my first specialization and i was lucky enough to do the interesting one at the beginning so i feel compelled to end it but really i am not sure it was worth my time	1
it uses mixed material from other platforms meant for pure python programming learning jumps between sections in the external platform going forward and back so its pretty confusing to find problems involving content that you have no chance to know if you do not have previous experience with python i would not recommend this course for beginners in programming	0
could add a lot more exercise specific information	3
i wouldnt never recommend this course the teacher gives you all inforation without normal explan you have chanse to understand html and css but js  js leguage need more deteils exemples and explaining who i didnt find in this course the first course is a basis for late courses and so weak teacher i took the next series of course coz i saw that there are other tacher	0
therere some errors in subtitle around the integrals weeks	3
took the free version of this course to learn some basic building blocks of android app dev and to dive back into programming already having java knowledge from long ago for my purposes it was a good intro for a totally new coder this might not be best as there isnt deep explanation of the code itself but for the rest it allows you to quickly dive in	3
good explanation of few design ideas and technics	3
it most be more effective	0
very helpful for beginnersinstructor teaches every details you need to start as a web developer	4
great course	4
excellent course you can go into great detail in understanding the intricacies of the sonatas or you can simply come away with a deep appreciation for beethoven his works and what goes into playing them	4
the course content was not very appealing explanations were not that engaging what i really missed was the actual practical aspect where you dont work with command prompt but an much more user friendly interface that is more up to date with current standards	1
thanks for your effort to make videos but this is the first time find a class that i can not submit my answer to check if it is correct or not before my account is upgraded disappoint to coursera and duke	0
interesting overview on the topic	2
great course a complete introduction to this language teacher is very capable and clear	4
nice course but need more detailed one for those new to statistics	3
of course its a nice course but the calculations were little more for me to understand as i am a medical doctor i enjoyed the course thanks one and all for helping me to understand the course	3
this was the worst course i have taken with asu on coursera feedback was minimal and the system had many technical issues videos didnt start properly and there was no help or feedback from the instructors or the peers i have wasted a lot of time resubmitting my assignments due to technical issues waste of my time	0
packed full of real world case studies and concepts we had a very good idea of how to apply these concepts as well there were also welldesigned assignments to trigger our thinking and knowledge synthesis	3
good course providing more analogy to concepts will make it more interesting	3
good course with valuable and relevante examples and explanations	3
not much useful if you want to learn about iot but helpful if you want to learn historical development that lead to iot	2
this course relies almost exclusively on self learning of the details of pandas it would be greatly improved by examples of how to use pandas to solve problems similar to the assignments	2
an interesting course even if you dont complete the assignments because you can expect to get around an  even if you fully grasp the subject matter due to the peer review requirement the course would be much better without that requirement	2
assignments are not always relevant or clearly explained more resources on how to complete them properly for example suggestions about how to do prototyping and what tools to use would also help improve this course	1
this course is supposed to be part of specialization unfortunately this is a second course and the first part doesnt provide necessary information on what we actually do with galaxy it felt like following instructions to push certain buttonsi would only recommend it to knowledgeable people with certain background that should be listed as a required knowledge i hardly learned anything except for that there is something called galaxy we do some analysis by pushing buttons using preconfigured tools i dont have expertise to analyse data on my own unfortunatelyas i applied for a financial help here i wont complain much 	0
too much focus on technicalities  not management based	1
the last  lessons did not have much content particularly there was no practical assessment on traveling salesman	2
good course to hone time management skills	2
theoretically the course is very lacking there is little focus on the scholarly work in the field except perhaps the first few lectures the content and scope of the course is too small overall however the content is good for a very basic introduction and	2
the course was very well organized but the main topics of the course were still covered the lessons needed to be more structured and not so adhoc the final assignment was peer reviewed but the feedback based on student feedback was not very useful	2
this course should be a  star course it is challenging and requires effort the lectures are well done but not up to the level of the quizzes the book looks like an abandoned project the errors and missed references to tables and equations from part one of the book to the other are too manyhaving said that i have never learned so much about a topic i attempted the problems in the book before i took the quiz that makes a huge difference a week covers  chapters in the book i started to doing the each chapters problems before moving on in the week this made taking the quizzes a lot easieroverall i am very happy for having taken this course	2
for a while thats the worst course of scala specialization all the parallelism is just obvious division of a one big piece on several small pieses and perfrom parrallel tasks on it its enogh to write merge sort with several threads to get the main idea which is proposed here you dont need to watch  weeks of coursera video and perform tasks to get it maybe im wrong but i expected something more than trivial division besides that i dont like the tasks and i hate the last one week very bad description of the problem it made me really suffer id like much more the first  courses which i rated as  and  accordingly but this one is fail besides that i like the theory about parallel and concurent programming and all the stuff about iron hope the th one course will be better	1
the videos just gloss over the materials no comprehensive lecture notes or standard textbook and lessons are too squeezed	1
a little succinct and could have gone in to far more chemistry detailsthe teachers are a little difficult to understand at times and a little repetitive as well but overall an enjoyable course	3
the course didnt feel as though it was aimed at a university level audience which is what i expect from coursera courses i i did appreciate the prompt that the assignments gave me to actually sit down and write but so far the feedback wasnt very helpful i think that there should be much more guidance on how to give good feedback to peers reading a good number of submissions from members of the course i didnt feel that this course gave them the practical skills needed for good prose but w	1
uncomfortable to watch and also a very outdated layout of the course feels like a bad s american talk show	1
great course for a beginner it is well organized and presented in a way that is designed to make you learn and be successful	4
i cant see the course teacher so it look like the all parts of course are the same	1
topics were basic but good but i cannot understand why a physics undergrad with no screen presence and mispronunciations was asked to lead this course instead of the mba professor who was advertised i found that there were at least a couple of places that were ageist and overly simplistic in talking about retirement planning and there were moments that there was a paranoid antigovernment vibe that i found offputting	1
very thought provoking and informative	4
i think it is really necessary to establish better the target auditory for this course the students with very basic level of english have to study with advanced nonnative speakers and with natives the exercises can be too challenging for the first category sometimes boring for the second and absolutely superfluous for the third	1
too theoretical without enough practical quiz and assignment	1
does not teach excel very well while tryng to apply the basic usage instruction to not too difficult problems the ability to interface with excel after some knowledge of pythonr or other programming languages would be helpful in the data science programming that is increasingly being promoted	1
so academic interview with students has no value and no point	0
great course it open ed up my eyes to how simple it can be to generate a workable mvc web application without having to dive too deep into the working of the application	3
the grading is kinda problematic because you can just grade with  or  nothing in between also for the assignments it is hard sometimes to figure out how to solve the problems and external materials are neededthe professor is really good though and so are the lectures	3
very very very basic intro the entire  weeks could have and should have been condensed into  week	1
awesome course	4
the course is wellstructured and the autograder really streamlines the coursei enjoyed dr chucks explanation and lecturing style very much i think it is a very good introduction to python and programming in generalhaving said that i actually already had experience programming with c  java and so its difficult to provide useful feedback regarding course difficultyps love the book	3
this is a really good one and of course i had a very good time during the course and really great thanks to the educators of the course and coursera	4
thank you	3
i am getting this message that i have excced time specify to submit assignment but it still remain  days i will like my account to be review and open thanks for providing this online platform	3
this course was basic yet covered many important elements for research design it helped me to better understand the parts of design the readings were relevant and the assignments were thorough enough to solidify main ideas the videos were interesting i would recommend the course for beginners	3
this is definitely a course for someone that has finished a higher degree if youve done that theres a very big change that you already know about  of the techniques presented in thous course	0
i liked this course  very informative the instructor telling industry stories helped with remembering details and none of the videos were too long it does get a tad complicated as it gets into commissions and copyright details but never overwhelmingi bought the instructors book but only used it once still its a good reference for the future	4
you really need prior coding experience to understand the training i also was very disappointed in the teaching we have an incredible opportunity to improve education and i feel that this course is merely an extension of current learning techniques it was extremely difficult for me to fully participate without paying i was using this course to make a specific android app to control my wheelchair i act as an analyst for my programmer husband so i fully understand code architecture but absolutely hate coding by hand this course glossed over coding however it is far more code intensive then i was led to believe	0
rather uninteresting presentation i found it hard to become interested in the course or kierkegaard after having high hopes of truly enjoying it the best parts of the lectures were when the instructor was taped at venues pertinent to the course the peer reviewers were not always fair in my opinion id spend my time elsewhere personally especially since this course was something for my own personal edification and not a requirement	0
the way this course was presented was quite unique watching a few people from various walks of life but most related to the university discuss various topic and exchange opinion and experiences about positivityi liked the material provided for meditation about loving kindness and i have been using it on a daily well  days a week basiswhy i gave only  starsthe material was overall rather shallow  after reading about positive psychology i still very little substance it has to offerin addition barbare is not the greatest and most charismatic speaker in the world although she did surprise me in her ted talkin general human emotions are operating on a scale from positive to negative positive psychology takes a onesided approach by looking only on the plus side that is about as incomplete as the approach of focusing only on the pathology to fully grasp a human being there must be a third way is it philosophy	2
even though i didnt learn anything significantly new from this course i believe it served as a great refresher when it comes to data management also this course could also be applied to data management in general and not just for clinical research	4
cannot believe charge me homework	1
too basic the tasks are pretty plain course just scrapes the surface without giving any understanding of working with js the course htmlcss and js by d rossiter provides a far better understanding	2
loving this course	3
great course for beginner	4
its better to watch the youtube videos to understand the concepts	0
handy tool to pull out data and analysis but the learner themselves need to practice m	4
this class required far too much independent study the instructor did not provide enough instruction or reading material to complete the quiz each week there was too much focus on the conceptual data with very little emphasis on practical application of the material	1
this course needs an overhaul there are mistakes in some code examples and quiz questions are sometimes ambiguous while i appreciate the work that has gone into making this mooc there are better courses available on coursera to learn this material	1
i thought the course did a nice job of covering the subject but it seemed to jump around from the original struct	3
poorly organized and managed each week of this course should have been broken down into individual  week courses i have  years software development experience and i can tell you this is too much information to cram into a single class	0
great course with excellent content	4
one would learn a thing or two but the course is very sparse compared to other machine learning courses and i didnt feel that it was worth the time and the cost	1
an interesting introduction to epidemiology i felt that the statistical concepts this course covered were clearly explained and the numerical examples helped further my understanding of these principleshowever from the course description i expected the course to talk more about concepts it covered this a little bit eg the bradford hill criteria and perhaps the state of modernday epidemiology than it did for example studies and successes from within the last  years i would love to see a followup module on that topic	3
very basic	0
nice addition to the competitive strategy course although not as interesting and practical as the first part cases and current examples would have made this section much betterprof tobias kretschmer   starscompetitive strategy     starsadvanced competitive strategy   stars	2
quite good the production is superb and the script also meticulous worth any minute	4
not so inpiring	2
this course is a nice introduction to scala	4
mostly disappointing i found only one week interesting and nonbiased	1
to be honest i dont think this is worth the money	0
very useful course 	4
very informative and practical coursethanks faculty and team	3
if you are not familiar with ai you can learn its basic ideas in this course however  no moderators or teaching assistants answer questions in the discussion forum  no slides are provided for preview and review  the lecturer is very good but the contents are basic more stateoftheart practical materials would help a lot  some vides are too fast to follow	2
great explanations and exercises	4
this course proves to be very informative and the quizzes push to discover new sources for course material however it is highly focused on the programs set by the un and could provide more solutions and feedbacks on what is being done very much oriented toward public policies good experience overall	3
a very organized and well guided course however the contents are fairly difficult for a preuniversity students	3
sometimes the teacher only shortly mentions things and then goes on with major exlanations about other things which is fine because i assume he will go deeper into the material later on but when we had to do the final exam for week  they asked questions about what happens if there are two commands in the brackets like this changeme changemeagain the teacher never ever mentioned that the first command is the most important one and the second is a kind of fallback for example and even if he did mention it it was only a kind of sidenoteand did not seem that important so all in all i really do like this course but instructions arent always super clear	2
it was efficient and effective	3
unsufficient information for the programming assignments	0
i knew r and was looking for an intro to python if you already know some programming this class is too basic	1
good to be able to apply the lessons from the individual courses in one single project but i missed having actual teachers to review my work as well	2
lots of material needs additional study from different sources as its only summarily explained much math without the link to the praxis 	2
nice beginner course	3
great course it gave me an overview of antibiotic resistance problems	4
just a collection of materials youd find in any museum	0
course is well presented and is very easy to understand	4
i learned many thing in this course it will be knowledgeable for all the web base students	2
good explanation good examples however i found some mistakes in tasks	3
interesting course but the lecture videos are too long	2
informative course it dispelled some myths about infographics if youre auditing the course you can only view the material not turn in assignments	4
this course contains too few solid content	1
good inntroduction to tcpip and ip v and v	3
the class gave me nothing nobody wans to waste tons of hours to learn nothing so i personally think this course is on of the worst classes among the coursera	0
a very dense and instructive lesson a bit sad that it is already over	4
too much bla bla bla very slowly very boring	2
i suggest to include more and clearer examples to solve problems	0
make the other courses free	0
pretty basic course with a lot of dead time not really learning anything about excel tutor should consider a few more advanced and useful topics	1
a good start	4
not perfect because in the video multiple times the lecturer mentioned external information or links that didnt exist no additional information was provided	3
great idea but unprofessional design and programminglooks like nobody doublechecked it before starts to offer it especially for moneyalmost every quiz and separate questions has programming bugswaiting for ver  asap	1
if you dont want to actually learn what anything means and just get walked through steps on how to do things then take this course but if youre a beginner to html css and java script this isnt for you he doesnt actually teach you anything he just takes you through the process they havent updated the course content to actually match what is on githubs page so from the start you have to go into the faqs to figure out where to go from there its really frustrating because he will just skip steps and because he doesnt explain why hes doing something if you miss a step you get completely lost ive taken a few coursera courses and this was the most frustrating course i have taken	0
not what i expected though the lecturer quite patronising and the exercises too juvenile did not finish the course so it may have improved after the first few sessions thank you	0
great course learned a lot thank you	3
i have never studied any online lesson that is fascinating like this one	4
this is very good and i would recommend it but it is quite short compared to other coursera courses that i have paid for i think they should add more content for the price they are charging	3
university of michigan is the way to go this course is very out of date	1
ridiculous  unscientific selfhelpie far below of even talkshow standards it gives bad reputation to any business school that endorses such course	0
good intention but the programming assignments were much much harder than what was covered in the mostly theoretical lectures and the more practical but not as advanced swirl exercises after reading other reviews of this course and struggling to complete the first programming assignment i canceled please do not advertise this as for beginners  i think people who have had some programming experience before would find this great but not for the newbie	1
thank you so much jeff iy was usefull course i think it needs to extend the material and learnings periodthank you so much	3
javascript part is not covered in depth	2
good introductory course on r language	2
bloody coursei am very much angry with this course	0
the course can use more visuals instead of videos of the face of the instructor it can also use more interactive examples as this is a more executive view instead of having scholar examples	2
when you are late in delivery they tell you everything is fine do not worry you have until the last week of the course to complete the activity get your note and end of the course theyll repeat over and over again in every week my course ended on may  but they have not let me present my last activity may  even before the final exam they have forced me to leave the current session still unfinished deadlines missing a single activity after two months of work and enroll again in the next session which still nor has begun delaying all the planning i had made for the entire course and all terms of the following coursesin short disastrous system to keep deadlines and complete the courses that make it totally useless any planning you have to do to set the course for the months that suit you which in my case at least may at risk which i can complete the full specialization before the deadline money thrown away	0
very pedantic course teacher just repeats the information on the slides verbatim an interesting subject is made quite dull would request more emphasis be put on presentation skills as the course material seems ok for a refresher	0
for a beginner it is a fair start but definitely many things could have been better the course does cover the main subject concepts in fair amount of depth and with decent rigor the course videos are sometimes kind of less engaging many a times i felt my interest waning off many a times the mathematical equations looked daunting i think more focus should be put on including more number of real world examples and solving them within the videosalso the concept of three professors for one course was hard to digest which led to the whole course feeling discontinuous and disconnected at several instances	1
the course material was useful however greatly disappointed with the organisation many quizzes had incomplete questions no figures and there was no corrections made i had to resort to checking through forums for the correct questions	1
from my perspective the individual courses that made up the capstone people customer accounting and operations analytics were both educative and interactive these individual courses contained data focused problems and gave a general overview of the specific fieldhowever the final capstone project was entirely disappointing and something i even plan to complain to coursera about after having a two month delay the course not only lacked any direction but seemed to be put together last minute without any real thought or plan the entire capstone was driven by hypotheticals almost all of which did not have any relevance to the past four courses an educated individual could easily complete this capstone without any knowledge whatsoever from the previous four courses the capstone provided a few articles and videos related to the issue yahoo ad blocker to help us solve the problem but clearly the course heavily lacked content i was expecting the course to contain hypothetical data for us to interact with and predict how the ad blocker problem and our proposed solutions would drive the data of yahoos business however the course merely was driven by complete hypotheticals that only required one to be educated about general business functions this capstone hardly related to the previous four courses and it is a scam that this course cost 	0
excellent teaching but its not actually free you must pay in order to access the assignments and the professors inbrowser python sandbox	0
overall okay course but the lectures are too focused on theory with some applications to the real world i think this course needs to be reconfigured and taught from an applied focus instead of  applied  theoryalso the new format is horrible and tas are nonexistent as are discussions in general on the forums now the tas were a critical learning component before especially considering that unlike on edx where course staff actually participates in the forums on coursera i do not think i have ever observed course staff actively participating in the forums	1
some questions in the quiz for module  are unclear and seem unrelated to the course work	0
not really helpfull	1
could use more content breezed through in h on x speed achieving 	3
i felt like the c programming parts were a bit too fast specially the enviroment setup but i loved this course congratulations and thank you	3
perfect	4
this class had a lot of good material and it truly showed how powerful gis is in analysis my recommendation would be for this class to be broken into two sessions to really practice everything that was taught in the videos however i plan on doing this on my own through the gis help boxes before i take the th class	2
i really didnt learn much too much code too complex too fast	2
not much useful limited in interactivity dropped out after a week and half	0
too basic and too easy but helpful content	2
fantastic course really mean that 	4
very relevant and without a lot of unnecessary information found the segment topics and lectures easily understandable and immediately applicable to my current worktwo thumbs up	4
i just finished the first week course its simple but concise	4
the best course for those who want to get introduced with the magic of internet and its working	4
very approachable teaching style	4
been asked to retake all assignments after paying for a certificate i wil never pay for a coursera course again and i would not recommend my friends to do so	0
it accomplishes the main goal help with the leap from c to c but its damn slow i had to use the x or x speed all the time and im not native english the format of the slides is really ugly eg those bullet points in the code no lecture notes are provided the references are to his expensive books instead no source code of examples is provided either graph theory is interesting but out of scope waste of time for those who already know it are not interested in and just want to learn c it would be better to provide references for optional reading or reviewing	2
very hard to follow needs to clarify more on its work	0
badly formulated alternatives in the multiple choice test	0
pretty good first introduction	3
great thank to jim fowler and the rest disagners of this course for outstanding course  this course discovered calculus better than a year of calculus in my university allthough it wasnt mathematition university topics was same as on the course	4
the code teacher used is out of maintenance students have to spend a lot of unnecessary time fix it even i have purchase it and finished week  i still chose to drop out not great learning experience 	0
as usually johns hopkins offers very disappointing courses because of their boring lectures and senseless quizzes	0
bad coarse unclear one	0
amazing i recommend it to all who want to simply be introduced into the complicated world of game development the videos and your classmates are a tremendous help so make sure to interact with them frequently	4
thanks a lot for a lovely course i rushed through it in  weeks in excitement this course is not only good in its content and rigor i also found that i was able to absorb mathematical concepts much better than i would in a pure math class i typically took about an hour per min of lecture and paused in the middle to really take in the maths and that helped a lot the nonacademic highlight of the course was definitely prof rao sense of humor only thing that could be nicer is the discussion forum which was pretty empty  all the more reason to join in and contribute	4
excellent material good organization and presentation but  too many demanding peerreviewed assignments for such a short course	1
great course	3
this course was good it was great to refresh knowledge	3
had a lot to learn from this course  thanks	3
handon exercises and intuitive explanations are those i like most in this course	4
got to pay but besides that its more about him talking less learning about anything	0
pretty nice course on par with the more popular coursera course cryptography i by dan boneh  more of an introductory course for applied cryptography while cryptography i is somewhat more theoretical useful introduction to dh and rsa purely optional programming assignments  	3
aside from week  i found this course to be little more than a commercial for various social analytics programs also theres a google assignment google wasnt relevant five years ago let alone in  theres some potential in this course but it desperately needs to be updated for  this course may be helpful to people just starting out as social media professionals but if youre already working in this field you will find this course incredibly dull	1
great course	4
the quality of this course is very low and the content are not interesting and useful at all	0
a lot of good information but i found it hard to retain most of it without a less dry style of presentation assignment were quite hard and instructions were a bit too sketchy	2
good corse	3
extremely useful info but the material is too shallow to be satisfying	2
very bad course no videos just an interactive textbook the course states all you need is high school level biology yet you require coding knowledge for the very first quiz there are side questions on the first week like does this algorithm runs in ok  l  x or oxllogk without any explanation i guess you can find much much better book about bioinformatics and as this course is nothing more then a book i recommend a better one	0
absolute beginners course quick and easy overview of the absolute basic features in python 	3
i learned very useful programming techniques but im a bit lost as to whether these techniques are good practices or if they are existing parallel programming features in java transposed asis in scala	3
course academy and historic	0
the course is very interesting and challenging but there are mistakes in the videos and too much mathematical theory with relation to examples	2
i like it as always chuck is clear and wise in make everybody undertand the contents of the course thanks	4
this course was full of issues related to the installation and use of pentaho pivot j and data integration the professors presence is resolving these issues was practically nonexistent coursera needs to do a much better job at insuring that their professors are offering a quality course and living up to the expectations of the students in the case of this course and the professor they failed miserably in addition it is practically impossible to get support from coursera when an issue exists and in most cases when contact is made the assistance is minimal it is a shame as the platform is nicely designed and the course topics are very interesting if you are considering taking this course be forewarned that the majority of the support of problemsissues come from the community not the professor or coursera in addition you are required to grade the assignments of your fellow students this is not done by the professor	1
bit basic for people who already know c or any other language but it is still effective	3
they do learn you about validation but the spoken language is not that great and the steps are way to quick to do this in practice yourself the help is also a bit shallow when doing the actual tasks its a good course if you want to learn about it and have a case as an example not great if you want to simultaneously validate your own startup	2
more challenging questions expected	1
truly rewarding class	4
very bad useless course just listing the names of the methods and practices	0
thanks so much for a solid course that covers all the main pillars for understanding the structure and philosophy of the union particularly important in those time of crises in which the raise of populism and far right political agenda is being used as a tool to assign responsibility to the eu to failures at national level lack of transparency and accountability in addition to a lack of leadership is the real responsible of this crisis of credibilityis for this reason that its essential to educate people around the meaning of the eu and this course fully achieves this goal only one point to take it into account that is regarding the feedback from peers in my case were not quite useful without almost no analysis and without understanding the meaning of the assignment in itself itd be good to further consider this aspect andor see other alternatives like the intervention of the facilitator	2
didnt really cover how to deal with messy data eg if you need to join to datasets and have orphans or you have no foreign keys between two datasets and you need to use fuzzy matchingbasic validation was also not covered ie making sure that your data covers all that you expect	1
thank you so much for the most interesting course ive had real pleasure taking it	4
too long videos you should make more short videos instead of one boring long video you speak too slow and that makes a  minutes video turns into  minutes video	0
great	3
a little disappointed in this course it would have been better suited for the first part to a larger course other than a week long introduction to th subject	1
module about codecs was greatthe rest was too easy an equivalent to reading manual on internet no value added 	1
what a great course thanks professor andrew so much for sharing the knowledge on machine learning	4
clear teaching but too much basilar introduction	1
the best course of machine learning i had ever taken	4
 of the course is amazing the rest needs some work the course feels as if its target population is lowerlevel undergraduates or the general population would love to see more advanced graduate level content included	1
there is a high disparity between lecture content and the knowledge required to complete the assignments it would be great to have a complete walk through of each assignment showing the different ways in which the same functionality can be created after having submitted an assignment this would really had helped me to better understand why something is done in a certain way and improved my understanding of how r works currently there is zero feedback on completed assignments which does not aid learning	2
this course does not meet my needs and expectations the content is very focused on engineering projects the exercise demands a lot of time to understand the document it would be better to slice it in many exercises associated with each week	0
a lot of reading is needed which on one hand is beneficial to the students but on the other can be exhausting as well anyway i had a great time and gain a better perspective on terrorism	3
the proof can be more precise and specific	3
i really wonder why this should be a course at an university its just some sort of factdump of android and ios which ist current but will be outdated within four weeks seriouslyso to keep up with this issue its just better to read some blogs about this or type ios vs android in google	0
too short interesting but far too short	2
program instructions could be more specific make it clear exactly what format the programs output should be	2
a practical approach on the topics weve been studying in all previous courses and an effective way to apply that knowledge	3
very well presented and explained	4
another approach but mathematical demonstration is probably possiblecoursera offer technologies to avoid classroom demos on whiteboard	0
i was pretty upset by finding out there will be no fran at this course but dariush is an amazing teacher too i love how the material presents and exercises and examples are very interesting  stars no doubts	4
its a very good course but when we get to the part of really generating the app i had a lot of problems that were not covered in the course	2
i like this series a lot i didnt like that the last assignment is peer graded though because now i have to wait for somebody to see my assignment and grade it  but otherwise this was fun and a good introduction to working with databases i learned a lot	3
presenter is reading the slides i feel i would have been able to learn as much by just reading the slidescdn course is a bit more visual with some maps and charts used during the course	1
a bit boring lectures	2
wonderful course	4
very interesting material covered and indepth views unfortunately a few technical issues in quizzes	3
a nice and flexible course in which you can explore the wide range of possibilities from the minimum basic level of subject to studying all the additional material and problematics rather interesting functional approach to the structure of philosophical knowledge for the foreigners as i am the english is quite understandable it is subtitled but the subtitles are not necessary if you are above b  ielts  level and at the same time sufficiently sophisticated to acquire also some useful listening practice for academic ielts  pte academic tests	4
this is an introduction course and no advanced concepts are seen i think it provides a good background that is all if you have a solid technical programming databases etc knowledge maybe you will miss more handons for me for an introductory and theoretical course i expected more resources for example additional suggested readings optional exerciseslectures are well structured intro and summary at the end but i have missed presentations from some of the most interesting videos week 	2
the course is useful especially for individuals who are trying to improve their writing skills	3
good course but scala understanding is required for this course so please register for prior course in the certification task to easily complete this course	3
a lot of conceptual stuff going on i learned whats a high concept document a game design document and the importance of prototyping	3
this course seems light in content  too much time is spent reviewing case studies instead of discussing different ways to create documents that enable reproducible research perhaps this should be a topicchapter in another course and not a standalone course	1
very introductory this material could have been compressed into  week	1
the course lectures were too sparse leading up to the final very important assignment of learning to how to create an etl package more time and energy should have been spent on the technical aspects of the pentaho spoon program rather than doing overviews of application pros and cons	1
excellent class  the professor is dynamic and really interesting thank you 	4
it is a great course i learn a lot	4
all on demand flow are bad difficult to follow and see where we are and what is left	0
great it was	3
thank you	4
i loved it everything made absolute sense and was explained perfectly	4
great course overall however it does not go deep enough into its topic would have been nice to have more challenging excel exercices	2
pretty simple and handy overviewing of js like it	4
i did not like the teacher but i did like the course material	1
mediocre not that helpful not the best i was urged to skip all the vids in wk 	2
the first three weeks of this course is ok the last assignment is very poorly structured with uninformative instructions	0
i was inerested about this course but i couldnt understand enough  the speaker talked too fast and ive lost the main subject trying to understand sorry	2
good vibe but way too easy even for beginners i am no beginner but i finished the whole thing in less than an hour not much learned	2
very useful	3
this course was a complete joke many practice quiz questions and even test questions had wrong answers marked as right so you had to rewrite test over and over until you guessed which one of the wrong answers was right also there was a theme of lazily worded questions and answers throughout the entire course there is always a way to write in non ambiguous ways it just takes some effort very frustrating to decipher the lazily worded questions someone should have proof read this course i feel like an idiot for paying for it	0
nothing to do with iot misleading title and waste of time apart from several incorrections in the novel narration	0
presentation is good concepts explained in a simple and clear manner missing interactivity which is very important to retain the understanding of the concepts explained	2
the exercises lead you to the edge of a cliff then push you off no guidance good luck if you dont already know linear algebra matrix math and matlab ill be looking elsewhere to learn about machine learning glad i didnt pay for this course	0
a very good course to get a head start in datadriven decision making and the field of business analytics looking forward to more such courses from pwc	4
awesome course designed by professorvery well explaining means why its need and where we can use it thats important because without know use of any technology it will be hard to understand but here i got every thing about ruby and rails details thanks professors	4
maybe quite basic but useful on the certification path	3
very interesting introduction to augmented reality	4
the course gives an overly simplified vision of management but is still very useful as an introductory course	3
i dont recommend this class jogesh k muppala has very labored english and his pace and verbosity make the lectures hard to get through ive turned in around  assignments and have yet to get a grade on anything the course content is poorly organized and executed peer grading is just dumb and clearly doesnt work since i have yet to get a single assignment back when you turn in assignment files they cannot be opened and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues questions about the class and submitting assignments went unanswered my advice save your money and dont take this class	0
not very proper explanation of how to use control key with mouse to set button propertiesno discussion forum	2
interesting topics and some good information presented on a variety of issues for many animals and situations however presented info is often vague and generalized some sections discuss very little scientific data to back up claims made and course is generally not very rigorous or challenging	1
concentrated on image manipulation which would be ok if you wanted to build visual websites for a living if you want to code anything like business applications like i did i wouldnt do this coursebecause pixel manipulation wasnt something i was interested in in the javascript section at all i found the course really boring but it was too late to pull out	0
this course tries to cover the many aspects around the games industry but the coverage in each of the subject is not deep enough to be useful for example the instructor talks about project management public speaking how to write a resume etc the instructor starts by talking about why they are useful and then followed by one to two  minutes long video lectures each of these could worth a full coursera course and i am sure the other courses have better coverage than in this coursethe quiz questions are not well thought and do not stimulate thinking at all some of the correct answers are personal opinions but you have to choose them in order to pass the quizthe third peer grading assessment asks students to post a video either to pitch himselfherself or to pitch the game the student makes however the specialization up to this point does not equip student with the skills beyond the basics unless you are already in the industry i do not think anyone can make anything impressive to be worth pitching in front of the audience	1
well presented lectures	3
too easy	1
loved it	4
to much math	0
a good refresher but did not get to know anything new	2
death by power point if you can learn from essentially listening to a pod cast and reading unix type manual pages then this course is for you if youre like the rest of the population then these lecture videos are useless the only redeeming quality to this course has been the homework but you can find them online or come up with them on your own	0
not very explanatory	1
absolutely wonderful i learned a huge amount and giacomo was a very friendly and helpful teacher	4
its a really great project but one needs to have studied mechanical and really advanced level physics to do this project but i really got help of the discussion forums to complete the assignments but am not yet clear about the theory of aerial robotics	2
too simple to be realistic	0
good but short course the statment of acomplishment is unaviable for short course is a big price	3
useful informations but not very helpful for practical situations	2
excellent course to know the basics of data science	4
a solid introductory course with some interesting course materials and thoughtprovoking questions	3
useful overview for the specializationnot sure its the best overview of software product management outside of that context	2
boring and cant make sense of the presentation  language and idiom use	1
good course that introduces the idea of metrics if you already work with metrics you will not learn much new	3
no option of completing the course without paying so why do you call your site free online courses and why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments	0
you guys are just trying to sell your book	0
videos are okay content and labs are great minus a issue with one lab where the supplied files were probably designed for a later version	2
the lecture is not so fluent taught than other coursers in the specialization	3
i think the theory is too dense but with a weak link with r i understood better with swirl than with the videos id suggest a more organized video with less draws and annotations they confused me sometimes	2
while i like the content of the course but i felt too much of topics were crammed into one single course i had to struggle a lot to grasp the concepts on advanced algorithms by just relying on video lectures so i had to look around in the internet for additional resources nonetheless it was a satisfying experience though it took me a lot of time and effort to complete the assignments	2
easy to understand and very useful	4
excellent course but should be more in depth	2
this course gave me fundamental definitions about how our brain works highly recommendation for everyone from all background	3
very good as intro	2
very informative but not very focused or streamline the lectures on brain plasticity and such i found largely irrelevant to the subject matter maybe an attempt to make the lectures a little less wordy i know this is buddhism which is notoriously filled with concepts and long winded explanations but i think a lot of viewers could lose interest i enjoy the course but i already have a great deal of familiarity with buddhism i was a vajrayana practitioner for three years maybe a course focused more on shakyamuni and the basics of buddhist teaching along with a few courses familiarizing listeners to terms might be useful as a preliminary to the following courses	2
what a great course	4
unfortunately i did not find the course overly engaging and only provided very basic information it would have been more interesting to look at a few things more in depth	1
its really interesting course i like it very much thanks for all your cooperation and your education methods and thanks to coursera	2
great course i am now mentoring this course	4
great introduction to the various topics of the specialization introducing each of these topics in a generic way helps to get a sense of what they are about and what to expect from the specialization it might be a good idea to be explicit about the fact that this course really only has value added in conjunction with the other courses and not really as a standalone module	3
good course very education	2
great	3
this course is bad i try to ask for help and then mentors only reply with i cant help you because of the honor code well tat doesnt sound like much of an honor code to me of course i am doing my own work duh i just need help dont we all need help from time to time i think coursera needs a lot of improvement i am extremely dissatisfied with coursera and this course but especially the mentors and their lack of mentoring education should be uplifting and positive and an area where individuals can ask question and receive help and not be scolded for asking help or asking questions like a beat down dog i mean really i think coursera needs to go take some hints from a real school or university and seek information on education and how it is best when students teach each other and if i can ask for help and learn from others and give then the opportunity to help me that whats the point of a discussion board do away with the discussion board or change the way the honor code is written yes i agree with honor and doing your own work but come on help and tutoring is a valuable part of education and necessary to learning please make the necessary changes to better coursera and make it a more positive educational experience i mean please i am trying the best i can with what i have got and no one seems to want to help me learn and improve on my skills and my understanding make changes and make them nowanother reason i hate this course is that coursera does not believe in people helping one another then the mentors cant even explain how to work through the problem the menotrs make things more stressful than they need to be because the dont give help or hints or clues people need to talk to people on the phone or in person or the instructor needs to give better examples so people can better figure things out on their own i just think coursera is crap and this has been a very unpleaseant experience for me then on the discussing board i see others struggling with the same things and the mentos dont help them people are pleading for help and not receiving any guidance or direction to help them figure things out things need to change with this program they need to change soon	0
difficult and kind of tedious subject professor knows his stuff but has a foreign accent makes it a little difficult at times	2
very informative well organized and well presented my only complaint is that the class was a little on the short side and it could have went into more detail at a couple of points i would still recommend the course regardless of length and have	3
overall i sincerely think this course was useful to me i did learn and that is great i got some good advice from the reviewers and i appreciated most of the videos especially the shop talksbut i wish the instructor or his staff were more present in the discussion area and i would have preferred a better written material the transcripts are not formatted they are completely raw and difficult to usefurthermore i dont think it is normal that people duly registered to the class have difficulties to get their  reviews too many people have to ask for it in the forumsin conclusion a good course with good video material but a lack of presence and organization	2
this is easily the worst course in the statistics with r specialization contrary to the earlier courses which were very competently taught by dr cetinkayarundel teaching quality is very poor in this course both of the main instructors are unable to explain whats going on there is vagueness and ambiguity which is almost impossible for the uninitiated to resolve all in all a very frustrating experience the course would urgently need rerecording as it stands it shows a huge disrespect for the students time and effort	0
this course is very important nowadays	3
robert schiller has given a good start to understand financial markets which the course provided are informative coursera is a great place to learn different subjects without borders	2
great way to understand how chords work  the ear training quizzes were very helpful 	4
i would not recommend this course to anyone interested in an introductory linguistics course while i understood the content of the lectures discussion videos interviews language informant videos and required reading the quizzes were far too difficult for a beginner course i found myself wanting to drop the course and the discussion forums show i am not alone in my frustrations throughout the six weeks	1
