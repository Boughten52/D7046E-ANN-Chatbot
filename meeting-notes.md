#### Participants: All
* Familiarized ourselves with the project description.
* Discussed which IDE and source control to use; decided on PyCharm/VSCode and GitHub.
* Looked at the GitHub project board where issues can be created and assigned to a specific person.
* Next steps:
  * Download preferred IDE and get the test code running.
  * Create small, specific issues and start working with them (pick any issues you like).
  * Structure the project and start migrating code from the exercises.
* We meet during the scheduled project sessions on Thursdays, ready to present progress.
* Booked Mondays at 9 am (CET) for weekly meetings.
* Use the Discord server as a discussion forum for all kinds of questions.
